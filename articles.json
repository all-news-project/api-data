        "title": "Kremlin drone: Zelensky denies Ukraine attacked Putin or Moscow",
        "content": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied his country carried out an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin, which Russia says was an attempt on President Vladimir Putin's life. \"We don't attack Putin or Moscow. We fight on our territory. We are defending our villages and cities,\" he said, speaking on a visit to Finland. The Russian president's office said defences downed two drones overnight. It threatened to retaliate when and where it considered necessary. Unverified footage circulating online shows smoke rising over the Kremlin - a large government complex in central Moscow - early on Wednesday. A second video shows a small explosion above the site's Senate building, while two men appear to clamber up the dome. The Russian presidency said Ukraine had attempted a strike on Mr Putin's residence in the Kremlin and described it as \"a planned terrorist act and an assassination attempt on the president\". Officials said two drones targeting the complex had been disabled using electronic radar assets, adding that President Putin had not been in the complex at the time of the alleged attack. But Ukraine has said the Russian accusations are merely a pretext for massive attacks on its territory and the US says it is treating the Russian claims with a lot of caution. Mr Putin appears to be one of the most closely-guarded leaders in the world. At Putin events in Moscow attended by BBC journalists, extremely tight security has been in place, including extensive checks and long convoys of vehicles with airspace closed and traffic halted. However if what the Kremlin is saying is true, it will raise questions about how well protected the president really is. There will also be scrutiny over the effectiveness of Russian air defences. In recent months, anti-aircraft systems have been spotted on Moscow rooftops in the vicinity of key buildings. They have been placed there because the Kremlin is concerned that Ukraine, or those sympathetic to Ukraine, may attempt to carry out aerial attacks on high-value targets. Whatever actually happened on Wednesday morning, the question now is how Russia will respond. Some officials have already called for tough action. Russian generals have warned many times of harsh responses to any strikes on Russian territory. But it is unclear whether Russia has the capacity to carry out meaningful retaliatory strikes, or whether this incident will lead to any significant escalation on the battlefield inside Ukraine. A Ukrainian presidential adviser told the BBC the incident indicated Russia could be \"preparing a large-scale terrorist provocation\" in Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak said attacking Moscow made no sense for Ukraine but would help Russia justify its own attacks on civilian targets. On Wednesday Russian strikes on Ukraine's southern Kherson region killed 21 people. Mr Zelensky said the shelling had hit \"a railway station and a crossing, a house, a hardware store, a grocery supermarket and a gas station\". The victims included supermarket customers and employees of an energy company who were performing repairs, officials said. Mr Podolyak added that any drones flying over locations in Russia were down to \"guerrilla activities of local resistance forces\". \"Something is happening in RF [Russian Federation], but definitely without Ukraine's drones over the Kremlin,\" Mr Podolyak said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he could not validate Russia's accusation that Ukraine had tried to kill Mr Putin, but said he would take anything the Russian presidency said with a \"very large shaker of salt\". Mick Mulroy, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence and CIA officer, told the BBC that if reports of the incident were accurate, it was \"unlikely\" to be an assassination attempt as Ukraine tracks President Putin's movements closely and he was not in Moscow at the time. \"This may have been to show the Russian people that they can be hit anywhere and that the war they started in Ukraine may eventually come home to Russia, even the capital,\" he said. Alternatively, if the reports were not accurate, \"Russia may be fabricating this to use as a pretext to target President Zelensky - something they have tried to in the past\", Mr Mulroy said. Russia also noted the alleged drone incident had come shortly before Russia's 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow, which foreign dignitaries were expected to attend. The parade will go ahead as planned, Russian officials said. Moscow's mayor on Wednesday announced a ban on unauthorised drone flights over the city. Several Russian cities had already announced they would scale back this year's Victory Day celebrations. Russian authorities have cited security reasons and attacks from pro-Ukrainian forces for the changes. Explosions and fires have occurred in Russia in recent weeks.",

        "title": "Missing Australian fisherman's body found in crocodile",
        "content": "The remains of an Australian man who vanished while fishing with friends have been found inside a crocodile. Kevin Darmody, 65, was last seen at Kennedy's Bend - a well-known saltwater crocodile habitat in a remote part of northern Queensland - on Saturday. After a two-day search of the area, police euthanised two large crocodiles and found human body parts. Police said it was a \"tragic ending\" for Mr Darmody. A formal identification process will be carried out. Mr Darmody was an experienced fisherman and a well-known member of the community in Cape York. The two crocodiles, which measured 4.1m (13.4 ft) and 2.8m (9.2 ft) in length, were shot dead on Monday about 1.5 km (0.9 miles) from where he was last seen. Human remains were found inside only one of the reptiles, but wildlife officers believe both were involved in the incident. The fishermen with Mr Darmody at the time did not see the attack, but reported hearing him yell, followed by a loud splash. \"I raced down\u2026 but there was no sign of him, just his thongs [flip-flops] on the bank and nothing else,\" his friend John Peiti told the Cape York Weekly. Crocodiles are common in Australia's tropical north, but attacks are rare. Mr Darmody's death is just the 13th fatal attack in Queensland since record-keeping began in 1985. A fisherman was killed by a crocodile in similar circumstances on Queensland's Hinchinbrook Island in 2021, and there were also fatal attacks in the state's far north in 2017 and 2016. Since a ban on hunting in 1974, Queensland's crocodile population has rebounded from a low of some 5,000 animals to around 30,000 today. A 2019 report suggested an average of 1.7 adult crocs living in each kilometre of river surveyed. Under Queensland's management programme, \"problem crocodiles\" are removed from areas where they threaten public safety and, in rare instances, euthanised. Those numbers are dwarfed by Australia's Northern Territory (NT), which is home to the world's largest wild crocodile population of some 100,000 reptiles. Despite publicity campaigns to be \"crocwise\" around rivers, there was an average of 1-2 deaths from crocodile attacks in the Territory each year from 2005, but none have occurred since 2018.

        "content": "An emergency radio service for Sudan is to be launched on BBC News Arabic on Tuesday, by the World Service. The pop-up radio service will be broadcast twice daily for three months, providing news and information for people in the war-torn African nation. It will include eyewitness accounts and news on diplomatic efforts, the BBC said, and help counter disinformation. BBC director general Tim Davie said the move was \"crucial at a time of great uncertainty\". The programme will be broadcast live from London, with input and analysis from teams in Amman in Jordan and the Egyptian capital Cairo. It will be available on shortwave radio in Sudan, as well as online, where listeners will be able to hear information on how to access essential supplies and services, the BBC said. \"The World Service provides an essential lifeline to many around the world where access to accurate news and information is scarce,\" Mr Davie said in a statement. \"The enhanced emergency service for Sudan will be crucial at a time of great uncertainty in the country.\" Fighting that has erupted in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country is a direct result of a vicious power struggle within the country's military leadership. The clashes are between the regular army and a paramilitary force called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Liliane Landor, director of the World Service, said: \"The situation in Sudan has escalated quickly with its citizens seeking clear, independent information and advice at a time of critical need. \"BBC Arabic's Emergency Radio Service for Sudan will bring vital live updates of the situation on the ground and inform listeners of life-saving resources.\" The programme will broadcast at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on 21,510 kHz and 17:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on 15,310kHz. The first programme will be available on Tuesday afternoon. Have you been affected by the conflict in Sudan? Please email us: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

        "title": "Terrified Sudanese on the run from Arab militias in Darfur - again",
        "content": "Fleeing for their lives from Arab militias on the rampage is nothing new for the Sudanese people escaping over the border into Chad - their exhausted faces encapsulate the devastation and suffering they have been experiencing over decades. \"We barely managed to return home and start a new life when this fighting forced us to run again,\" Mahmoud Adam Hamad tells the BBC. The showdown that erupted on 15 April between Sudan's two leading generals has triggered another bout of ethnic conflict in Sudan's western Darfur region. The UN estimates that more than 100,000 people have fled the current countrywide clashes, with the largest number fleeing to Chad, just across the border from Darfur. Darfur has been in turmoil for years with violence between its various African and Arab communities. When non-Arabs took up arms against the government in 2003, complaining about discrimination, the government retaliated by mobilising and arming mostly Arab militias. Known as the Janjaweed, they were accused of widespread atrocities. Many of those Janjaweed fighters morphed into the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group that is now battling the army. Arab militias linked to the RSF appear to be taking advantage of the security vacuum in Darfur, unleashing violence that has led to an exodus of people from the region. Some, like Mr Hamad and his family, have ended up in a temporary refugee camp in the Chadian village of Koufroune. An estimated 8,000 people are at the camp, having managed to flee with a few of their belongings and livestock, a valuable asset that could help ease the hardship. Mr Hamad made two dangerous trips last week across the border to bring his two wives and eight children from Darfur. \"I made my journey mainly at night. I brought them in, moving from one location to another with my family until we arrived. \"I was nearly robbed on the second trip,\" he says as he stands next to his temporary shelter made up of sticks and plastic sheeting. His village was previously attacked in Darfur. He lost his farm and animals and some of his relatives were killed by the Janjaweed. \"We were beaten and lashed. We begged them for our release.\" Mr Hamad speaks about how, at the time, he fled from village to village and crossed into Chad. He later returned to Darfur with his family thinking it was safe, but he now finds himself back again. He is now earning a little money in the camp by using his cart to transport the belongings of other refugees. He uses the cash to buy extra food. Ibrahim Bashar Ebra, 83 and his wife, Maka Naseem Tabeer, 70, sit in the shade of a plastic sheet flapping in the wind offering them some respite from the extreme heat. They are surrounded by their belongings covered in blankets to protect them from the dust. They lost their livelihoods in the Darfur conflict after their farm was raided in 2003 and their livestock were stolen. In a later attack three of their children were kidnapped and they have no idea where they are. \"I became destitute without a home and totally dependent on others,\" Mr Ebra says. What forced him to move a fortnight ago was a militia attack on his village that killed many people. \"The whole village was burned to the ground. I was evacuated by a cart and brought here,\" he adds, pointing out that arthritis makes it impossible for him to move on his own. His wife turns to him and asks: \"What do you think about our future from now on?\" \"There's no government in Darfur, only the militias, who are killing, raping and kidnapping. Only God knows what there is in store for us,\" Mr Ebra responds. He says he will \"never\" go back. \"I am safe here; I am happy fetching water from this valley to drink. What would I earn from going back? I am a frail 83 years old, but mentally tough.\" For now, they are being looked after by UN agencies, including the World Food Programme (WFP). Tens of thousands of more refugees are expected and there are fears that the fighting in Darfur could snowball into a full-blown conflict. Chad already hosts more than a million displaced people, including nearly 400,000 Sudanese refugees from Darfur. The race is now on to get support to the camps before the rainy season begins, WFP country director Pierre Honnorat says. \"This is very much needed because in a few weeks, the road to come and assist them will be very very difficult. That's really the issue, we have to have the resources to be able to support them,\" he tells the BBC. The refugees in Koufroune may have reached safety, but like so many Sudanese their future lies in the hands of two generals fighting over their country. They are under intense diplomatic pressure to negotiate an end to the conflict, or risk plunging Sudan into a civil war that could be worse than those in Libya and Syria.",

        "title": "Belgrade shooting: Teen made 'kill list' for Serbia school attack",
        "content": "A teenager who killed eight fellow students and a security guard in a school in Serbia planned the attack for weeks and had a \"kill list\", according to police. The 13-year-old was arrested following Wednesday's attack at the Vladislav Ribnikar primary school in Belgrade. The boy's father and mother have also been arrested. Of those killed, seven of the victims were girls at the school, but the motive for the attack is still unclear. Another six pupils and a teacher were injured in the shooting, four more boys and two girls. A boy who was shot in the neck and chest is said to have suffered the worst injuries, while a girl is in critical condition with a head injury. Officers in helmets and bulletproof vests cordoned off the area around the school, located in the central Vracar neighbourhood, shortly after 08:40 (06:40 GMT). The suspect is alleged to have used his father's guns, both of which had legal permits. He is also said to have gone to a shooting range more than once with his father before the killings. In a televised address to the country, President Aleksandar Vucic described the attack as \"the most difficult day in the modern history of our country\". He said the suspect would be sent to a psychiatric clinic. Under current Serbian law, he cannot be held criminally responsible as he is under 14. Mr Vucic has suggested that the age of criminal liability may be lowered to 12 in the wake of the killings. He has also proposed several other reforms, including an audit on firearms licences and a tightening of the rules around who can access shooting ranges. Police say the suspect planned the attack a month in advance and that he had carried a \"priority list\" of children to target and which classrooms he would go into first. Four of those wounded, three boys and another girl, were stable and conscious on Wednesday. A teacher injured in the attack was also reported to have undergone surgery and the health minister said on Tuesday her life was at risk. Most of the victims were born in 2009 - meaning they were either 13 or 14 at the time of the incident. A national three-day mourning period starting on Friday has been announced. The sounds of crying parents could be heard on the streets around the school hours after the shooting. Milan Milosevic, the father of one of the pupils at the school, said his daughter was in the class where the gun was fired and managed to escape. \"[The boy] first shot the teacher and then he started shooting randomly,\" Mr Milosevic told broadcaster N1. \"I saw the security guard lying under the table. I saw two girls with blood on their shirts. They say he [the shooter] was quiet and a good pupil. He recently joined their class.\" \"I saw kids running out from the school, screaming. Parents came, they were in panic. Later I heard three shots,\" one student told the Serbian state broadcaster RTS. Mr Vucic said the suspect had become friendly with the guard, who was described by one parent as \"a man who loved kids\". Mass shootings are comparatively rare in Serbia, which has very strict gun laws, but gun ownership in the country is among the highest in Europe. The western Balkans are awash with illegal weapons following wars and unrest in the 1990s. In 2019, it was estimated that there are 39.1 firearms per 100 people in Serbia - the third highest in the world, behind the US and Montenegro. In the deadliest shooting since then, Ljubisa Bogdanovic killed 14 people in the central village of Velika Ivanca in 2013, and Nikola Radosavljevic killed nine and wounded five in the eastern village of Jabukovac in July 2007.",

        "title": "What do we know about drone attacks in Russia?",
        "content": "Russia says Ukraine has launched a series of drone attacks on its territory in recent weeks. It accused Ukraine of trying to kill President Vladimir Putin in an alleged drone attack on his residence in the Kremlin on 3 May. Ukraine denied carrying it out. There have been a number of reported drone attacks in Russia and in Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine in recent months - none have been officially claimed by Ukraine. A suspected drone attack injured over 10 Russian soldiers at a military training ground in the Voronezh Region on 10 May, according to local media reports. There have been reports of drones being shot down on the same day in the Kursk and Belgorod regions of Russia, which both border Ukraine. An oil refinery in the Krasnodar region of Russia, about 200km (124 miles) from the Crimean border was targeted by drones on 5 and 4 May, according to Russian media reports. Last month, a drone came down in the town of Kireyevsk, about 400km (249 miles) from the Ukraine border, injuring at least three people in an explosion after it was brought down, Russian state media said. In February, a drone crashed about 100 km (62 miles) from Moscow, in what the local governor said was an attempt to target civilian infrastructure. A picture of the wreckage appeared to be consistent with a UJ-22 - a type of drone manufactured by Ukraine. It has a range of 800km (497 miles) in autonomous flight. Its range under directly-controlled flight is much shorter. In December last year, a drone attack hit an airbase 600km (372 miles) north-east of the Ukrainian border, leaving three people dead, according to the Russian military. Since the start of 2023, the BBC - by analysing Russian media reports - has tracked more than 30 suspected drone attacks inside Russia and Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. These have mostly been in the Bryansk and Belgorod regions in Russia near the north-eastern border, as well as in Crimea. Oil facilities, airfields and energy infrastructure have all been targeted. We counted five drone strikes on oil depots. One of these was in Sevastopol, the capital of Russian-controlled Crimea, which was struck on 29 April, destroying several of its oil tanks. Layla Guest, an analyst at Sibylline security consultancy, says: \"Ukrainian forces will highly likely prioritise targeting oil refineries, as well as railway infrastructure and wider Russian logistics, to cause maximum disruption as part of their strategy ahead of the impending counter-offensive.\" Drones have been deployed by both sides in the conflict, with Russia using Iranian-made drones on targets in Ukraine. Ukraine says it is rapidly increasing its production of drones as demand grows on the front line. In terms of range, experts say drones launched from Ukraine could reach deep into Russian territory, and as far as Moscow, which is about 450km (280 miles) from the border. \"Although Ukraine has not confirmed that its armed forces carried out the attacks, I think that the pre-emptive raids we have seen last year prove that Ukraine has the capability to launch long range attacks of that kind from within Ukrainian territory,\" says David Cenciotti, editor of the Aviationist blog. Drone specialist Steve Wright also said it was possible that a drone could hit the Kremlin having been launched from within Ukraine. But he added: \"My guess is that the drone was launched from far closer in than that, as this would avoid it having to run the gauntlet of much of Moscow's defences.\" Ukraine's Minister for Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov recently boasted of a Ukrainian drone called the R18 that \"can fly from Kyiv to Moscow and back\". But he denied that he was calling for drone strikes on Moscow. Mr Cenciotti says: \"Ukraine has made extensive use of several drones, with the Bayraktar TB2 drone emerging as the real star of the air war for Ukraine, inflicting heavy losses on Russian forces, some of those caught on tape and circulated online.\" Turkey has sold Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine in recent months, while the Turkish manufacturer of the drones has donated some to crowd-funding operations in support of Ukraine.

        "title": "Syria on way back to Arab fold as isolation crumbles",
        "content": "They look like unlikely allies, but on Wednesday the besuited, secular Syrian President Bashar al-Assad warmly welcomed the bearded, turban-wearing Islamist cleric-cum-President of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, to Damascus. It was the first such visit by an Iranian leader since 2010, before the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then, Tehran has proved the staunchest of allies, helping - along with Moscow - to save the Assad regime during a particularly bloody civil war. The trip comes amid dramatic shifts in the region. These have also seen the Syrian president and his entourage - long shunned as pariahs in the Arab world - recently being embraced, quite literally on occasion, by their neighbours. Despite opposition from the US and Europe, it is becoming the norm for Arab states to take steps to normalise ties with Syria. Syria still hopes to be granted observer status at the Arab League summit in Riyadh on 19 May, ahead of its eventual reinstatement. \"The international community outside of the region - Russia aside - has largely washed its hands of responsibility for Syria,\" comments Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding (Caabu). \"There is a vacuum and this is where the regional powers have come in. [They see that] if nothing is going to change, if there is not going to be a real political process, then we as a region cannot afford to ignore Syria. It's too big and significant a country.\" The turnaround is remarkable. Back in late 2011, many Arab states were clearly planning for a post-Assad era when Syria was censured and suspended by the 22-member Arab League. I watched hundreds of Syrians waving flags and chanting their support of that move, close to the League's headquarters in Cairo's Tahrir Square. At that time there had been a brutal crackdown on Syrian pro-democracy protesters and I had reported on waves of refugees fleeing the fighting. But many of the regime's worst atrocities - the indiscriminate barrel bombing and poison gas attacks - were still to come. Now, over a decade on, the figures are jaw-dropping: about half of the Syrian population has been displaced or made refugees, and the UN conservatively estimates that more than 300,000 civilians have been killed and more than 100,000 detained or disappeared. It was Russia's military involvement in Syria in 2015 that changed the course of the bloody civil war and forced its neighbours to begin thinking of a future that left Mr Assad in place \"That was a game-changer for Jordan,\" says Osama al-Sharif, a prominent journalist in Amman, stressing how his country was facing a national security threat and turned to Moscow to apply pressure. \"At the time the war against Daesh [the Islamic State militant group] was also going on... We had [the Lebanese militant group] Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian groups positioned very close to the border.\" President Assad went on to consolidate control over much of Syria, but Arab moves to restore ties accelerated after this February's massive earthquake in Turkey and Syria - with the rush to bring in aid. Then came the China-brokered re-establishment of relations between regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia and its rival, Iran, which have supported opposing sides in the Syrian civil war. In the past few weeks, a beaming Mr Assad has been greeted in Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In Abu Dhabi, his wife, Asma, joined him for her first known official trip abroad in a decade, and was hugged on the tarmac by the wife of the UAE president. Meanwhile, Syria's foreign minister has been off to Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Jordan. The Saudis stressed that they were discussing \"the return of Syria to its Arab fold\". However, there are deep divisions between the Arab states on how and when to rehabilitate Syria. Qatar, Kuwait, Egypt and Jordan have apparently pushed back against plans by Saudi Arabia and the UAE for its rapid reinstallation at the Arab League. \"There seems to be a rush to restore relations with Syria but when asked, no-one could say what guarantees were being sought in return for normalisation,\" says an official from the region with knowledge of recent talks, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"It's a pity. It sends the wrong message. It says there are no consequences,\" the official continues, adding that the Syrians are acting \"in a very arrogant way, like everyone else is lucky to have them\". The US is clear that it does not support restoring ties nor lifting tough economic sanctions on an unapologetic, unreformed Damascus. In March, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf said: \"This regime deserves to be treated as the rogue that it is.\" However, she also urged Arab allies opting to end Mr Assad's isolation to \"make sure that you get something\". She suggested trying to end the trade in Captagon, an illegal drug which is produced in Syria and smuggled out. As I have seen at a hospital treating young addicts from Jordan and the Arab Gulf, this amphetamine - known as \"poor man's cocaine\" - is fast turning Syria into a narco-state and sowing seeds of misery across the Arab world. Other demands could be a reduction in Iran's military presence in Syria and setting conditions that would allow more refugees to return home or safeguard people living in parts of Syria still under opposition control. After years with little progress in talks with the fragmented Syrian opposition, many Arab states would also like to see at least a token effort by Damascus to re-engage. The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, is pushing for this. \"This renewed attention to Syria is very important if it can act as a circuit breaker and unlock long-stalled efforts to move the political process forward,\" he told the UN Security Council on 27 April. Many Syrians will feel let down by the new Arab overtures. Millions living in the remaining opposition-held pockets once viewed Saudi Arabia and other Arab states as allies in their struggle against Mr Assad's rule. They now find themselves more isolated. Refugees, particularly in Lebanon and Turkey - where acceptance has dwindled in the light of economic crises - are increasingly worried about the risk of forced returns. Turkey - which has been a main backer of Syrian armed opposition groups - has also been talking to Damascus. Almost all parties campaigning for its 14 May elections say they want to send Syrians home. \"We're extremely afraid about the election results. They clearly state that they want to deport us,\" says a Syrian refugee, Muhammad, in his Istanbul coffee shop. Human rights activists express huge disappointment that there is little reference to past atrocities in conversations about Syria's rehabilitation. \"It's shocking,\" says Diana Semaan, Syria researcher for Amnesty International. \"What we're seeing now is a complete disregard to the human rights records of the Syrian government and a message being sent that it doesn't matter what's happened.\" Amnesty urges Arab countries to use their influence with the regime to try to prevent further attacks on civilians and arbitrary detentions and torture. There are calls for co-operation as the UN tries to set up an international body to help families of those missing to find out the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. Meanwhile, in Geneva, a team of lawyers continues busily working to support the prosecutions of those accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. The UN's International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) for Syria has already helped in 267 cases, including 28 so far this year. Its head, Catherine Marchi-Uhel says: \"The fight against impunity is ongoing and will continue to be pursued.\" Some Syrians hope that normalisation in the region could mark the start of a return to normal life. Residents of government-held Syria are grappling with rocketing inflation and crippling power shortages. According to the UN, even before February's devastating earthquake hit Syria, 15.3 million people - 70% of the population - were in need of humanitarian assistance. However, Heiko Wimmen, who oversees International Crisis Group's work on Syria, stresses that, at this stage, Arab Gulf states are unlikely to contribute much to the billions of dollars needed to rebuild Syria's ruined cities. \"American sanctions are only one part of that problem. It's a very forbidding environment economically. You need some trappings of a functioning state and functioning governance, some basic level of accountability,\" he says. In order to survive, over the years the cash-strapped Syrian regime has raided and seized dozens of businesses. It stands accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid meant for impoverished Syrians, as well as alleged drug trafficking. It is an irony that the problems caused by the Syrian government ensure that it can no longer be ignored by its neighbours - even if Syria's war and its fallout have largely fallen off world news bulletins.",

        "title": "Row over Met Gala's tribute to Karl Lagerfeld",
        "content": "This year's Met Gala - an annual celebration of all things fashion and celebrity - was billed as a tribute to the late German designer Karl Lagerfeld. A-listers invited to the glamourous fundraiser in New York were asked to pay homage to the man who, as creative director for Chanel and Fendi, was one of the industry's most prominent and prolific figures. But he was also controversial, and his views on the #MeToo movement and Germany's decision to open the door to Syrian refugees widely condemned. Among those to have criticised Monday's event on social media is BBC Radio 1 DJ-turned-Hollywood actress Jameela Jamil. Others have suggested some attendees deliberately chose to wear outfits that would have challenged Lagerfeld's views. And notable absences from the red carpet included singer Lana Del Rey, whom he once called \"a little too fat\". Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who co-chaired the event, told BBC News it was a night to celebrate Lagerfeld's body of work - not the man. But Jamil accused organisers of awarding \"the highest honour possible to a known bigot\". In a post on Instagram, the British actress said: \"Last night, Hollywood and fashion said the quiet part out loud, when a lot of famous feminists chose to celebrate at the highest level a man who was so publicly cruel to women, to fat people, to immigrants and to sexual-assault survivors. And all the women's publications, and spectators online, chose to gleefully ignore it.\" The Good Place star accused the industry of \"slippery tactics and double standards\", separating the art from the artist when it was \"convenient\". \"This isn't about cancel culture. Its not even about Karl,\" she said. \"It's about showing how selective cancel culture is within liberal politics, in the most blatant way so far. \"And it's not just Hollywood here - the general public online participated and were entirely complicit in the erasure of the truth last night.\" Meanwhile, Piers Morgan used a column in the New York Post to accuse the celebrities who attended the Met Gala of hypocrisy. They turned \"a blind eye to his monstrously offensive side just because they want to wear his fabulous clothes and show off at one of the biggest media events of the year\", he wrote. Few other celebrities have spoken out against the decision to honour Lagerfeld - but there has been social media speculation that some used other means to protest. A picture of famously proudly plus-sized pop star Lizzo eating chips while wearing her red-carpet outfit was posted on her social-media accounts. Her black dress with pearls echoed a famous Lagerfeld piece worn by Linda Evangelista in 1991. But was her pre-show snack simply preparation for the night ahead, after complaining last year about the lack of food and a long queue for the red carpet? Or was it a retort to Lagerfeld's opinions on fuller figures? \"No-one wants to see curvy women,\" he once said. And asked about women who object to thin models, he replied: \"They are fat mummies sitting with their bags of crisps in front of the television, saying that thin models are ugly.\" Many guests wore black and white - reflecting Lagerfeld's signature look - but some, including actress Viola Davis and model Ashley Graham, wore pink. But had they decided to deliberately ignore one of his most quoted mantras, \"Think pink, don't wear it\"? Or did they just like the colour? After all - despite his outspoken opinions - pink did appear in some of his collections. Graham wrote on Instagram: \"Honoured to wear this show-stopping creation... paying tribute to the iconic Karl Lagerfeld - I just feel so beautiful\", while Davis called it a \"true princess moment\". Singer Courtney Love, a friend of Lagerfeld, complained on Twitter that in general the Met Gala showed \"total disrespect for your legacy\". That, and it was \"BORING\".",

        "title": "Dancing on the grave: The decades-old murder that shook India",
        "content": "Shakereh Khaleeli was \"rich and beautiful\" and came from one of the most aristocratic families in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. But in 1991, the wealthy heiress went missing and it seemed like she had vanished into thin air. For three years, her second husband - Murali Manohar Mishra, better known as Swami Shraddhananda - made up fantastic stories about her whereabouts. In 1994, her remains were dug out from under the courtyard of their swanky home in the city of Bengaluru (then Bangalore). Shakereh had been drugged, packed in a wooden casket and - it was later revealed - buried alive. In 2003, the trial court convicted Shraddhananda for murder and gave him the death penalty, which the high court later confirmed. The courts accepted that he had pursued and married Shakereh for her wealth and properties worth billions of rupees. During his appeal, the Supreme Court called it a case of \"a man's vile greed coupled with devil's cunning\", but commuted his sentence to life in prison \"without remission\". Last week, the top court refused to entertain his plea for parole. The sensational crime that shook India 30 years ago is the subject of a new web show being streamed on Amazon Prime Video called Dancing on the Grave - named so because of the dance parties Shraddhananda reportedly held in the courtyard where his wife lay buried. Its producer Chandni Ahlawat Dabas of India Today Originals Production says there were \"whats, whys and hows\" around this crime that still seemed unbelievable. \"Despite being 30 years old, we felt that this was a crime that needed to be shared because it's such a mystery even today,\" she adds. The series on the murder - and the murderer - fails to answer all the questions, but it's a riveting watch and has generated a lot of attention in India. The first two episodes of the four-part series delve into Shakereh's life. The granddaughter of Sir Mirza Ismail - who served as the Dewan of the princely states of Mysore, Bangalore, Jaipur and Hyderabad and is credited with building several landmark buildings and monuments - she was married to the dashing diplomat Akbar Khaleeli and was mother to four girls. Family members describe her as \"a charming, larger-than-life character\" who was \"fond of vintage cars, very social, very loving and loveable\". But in mid-1980s, she met Shraddhananda and her life took a sharp turn. BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi, who at the time worked for the Times of India newspaper in Bangalore and features in the docuseries, says \"the murder shocked people primarily because of the manner in which she was killed - the fact that she was buried alive\". The crime also \"became the talk of the town because Shakereh had married a man like Shraddhananda after divorcing her first husband\", he adds. In press clippings from the time, Shraddhananda was described as a school dropout from a poor family, a \"fake holy man\" and an \"errand boy\" who endeared himself to Shakereh by \"helping resolve some property matters\" for her and \"exploiting her desire to have a son by claiming magical powers\". Reports say their relationship began to unravel soon after their marriage in 1986 and that the two quarrelled frequently, mostly over money matters, leading to Shraddhananda plotting to execute his wife in such a grisly manner. But despite the fact that he was found guilty by a total of eight judges from India's trial court, the high court and the Supreme Court, his lawyer insists that the evidence against him at best is circumstantial - and in the web series, we hear from Shraddhananda himself who still denies his crime. Some have questioned the show for giving a platform to a convicted murderer, but Patrick Graham, Mumbai-based British filmmaker who co-wrote and directed Dancing on the Grave, defends the decision to give Shraddhananda's story so much play. \"I think it's very important that we hear his side of the story, more so because we never heard from him in the past 30 years. Moreover, he gave us invaluable insights into Shakereh's character,\" he told the BBC. Graham says the team went into the jail because they wanted to find out how someone like Shakereh could be swayed by a man like Shraddhananda. \"But we were also swayed by him initially into believing that there were layers to the story, though none of us had any doubts about his crime by the time we finished with him.\" He says they went in, \"wary of coming across as bullies to this very small, frail, old man. But as we found out more about the story, and as we interacted more with him, we felt like he had an agenda, he was playing us, that he was spinning a yarn\". \"The more time we spent with him, the more it became clear to us that his feelings were not genuine, and towards the end we tried to have a more robust conversation with him,\" says Graham. And that, he says, resulted in \"a rant\" from Shraddhananda, with him \"insisting that he was innocent, that he was being treated badly\". In most true crime series, Graham says, a criminal is made out to be \"a genius\". \"But I was very clear that I didn't want to do that. Of course Shraddhananda had a few gifts, one of them was to make people believe him,\" he says. But in the end, he could not make the Indian courts believe in his innocence.

        "title": "Eurovision Song Contest 2023: Why it's about more than music for Liverpool",
        "content": "Beyond the Eurovision Song Contest's carnival of outlandish costumes, variable Europop and volatile voting, there is something bigger at stake for this year's host city. In a souvenir shop in Liverpool, some new additions are on display alongside the usual Beatles and football merchandise. There's a blue-and-yellow woolly hat with \"Liverpool\" on one side, \"Ukraine\" on the other, and the date 2023 (yours for \u00a319.99). There are heart-shaped fridge magnets with the city's Liver Bird mascot against a similar blue-and-yellow background, next to magnets with the faces of the Fab Four. There's a flag saying \"Liverpool song contest\" and the dates 9-13 May 2023. The word Eurovision doesn't appear - presumably for trademark reasons, as these are unofficial mementos. But the products are ready for the visitors who are expected to flood here for the annual continental music competition. It was awarded to the city after organisers decided it was too dangerous to be staged by 2022's winners Ukraine, following Russia's invasion. And while Liverpool is promising to put the country front and centre in its activities, and merchandise, it is also taking its own chance to harness the power of Eurovision. There are hopes that around 100,000 visitors and the exposure to 160 million TV viewers will boost the local economy. It's been transformed by tourism over the past two decades but also hit by the Covid pandemic. Eurovision could be worth \u00a325m to Liverpool this year and a further \u00a3250m from an upturn in visitor numbers over the next three years, according to council estimates. Meanwhile, NatWest has estimated that visitors will spend \u00a340m in the city across Eurovision week alone. \"It is a tremendous shot in the arm for the economy,\" says Dr Michael Jones, a senior lecturer in music industries at the University of Liverpool. \"The city council is determined to maximise it, to put the flags out and say, 'We're back as a city, come to Liverpool.' \"And I don't think that's at all cynical. It's an expression of self-confidence, and the city has struggled. This is an opportunity. It's maximising it, I think, in a thoughtful and sensitive way.\" Last year's contest attracted 55,000 tourists to Turin, despite some Covid measures still being in place. The Italian city said those visitors generated 23m euros (\u00a320m), with the media exposure worth an extra 66m euros (\u00a358m). Liverpool is hoping Eurovision's global spotlight will allow it to build on a 15-year period in which it has reinvented its image from declining post-industrial city to popular destination. In the decade before Covid, Liverpool saw an 87% rise in international tourists (compared with 37% overall for the UK). Music has played a big part in the city's fortunes, and Beatles tourism was estimated to be worth \u00a3100m to the city in 2019. Although Beatles tourism is not new, it has boomed in recent years, according to Jon Keats, a director of the company that runs the famous Cavern Club as well as an annual Beatles convention, which began in the late 1970s. \"When we started doing the Beatles convention, there were three hotels in the city, I think,\" he says. Now, Liverpool's global appeal is reflected in the audience when Keats performs as a singer in the Cavern himself. \"The other day I had [fans from] Honolulu on one side and Ecuador on the other side, wedged between Australia and Cleethorpes.\" Back in 2009, there weren't enough customers to open the Cavern all week. \"Then it just kept on getting busier and busier, to the point where we now have live music from 11:00 every day and it doesn't stop,\" he says. \"So there's been a massive change.\" This new Beatlemania is centred on Mathew Street, where the Cavern (resurrected in 1984 a few doors down from the original) has been joined by more themed bars, pubs and a museum. \"It's a busy street,\" Mr Keats says. \"There are many Beatle-themed [things], rightly or wrongly. This is another challenge for Liverpool - we need to make sure we don't turn Liverpool into a Disney version of the Beatles.\" While The Beatles are the main attraction, Liverpool is trying to draw attention to other strands of its musical identity. In the late 1970s and 80s, venues like Eric's - opposite the Cavern - produced bands like Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Echo and the Bunnymen, Julian Cope's The Teardrop Explodes and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. \"Eric's for me is way more important than the Cavern because of what came after it,\" says Frankie Goes To Hollywood guitarist Brian Nash. Nash has recently formed a supergroup of sorts with Peter Hooton and Keith Mullin of 1990s band The Farm. Instead of making music, they are leading guided tours of the city's post-punk and alternative music scene, as well as some Beatles-related heritage. \"There's so much more to Liverpool than that,\" Nash says. \"What we want to talk about is our time, and the changes that have happened in the city since then.\" Music was a bright spot in the 80s. At the time, riots, unemployment and poverty led Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe to urge Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to consider abandoning the city to a fate of \"managed decline\". Nash says residents of the 80s would \"never have predicted\" how far the city would come since then. \"If you were standing here in 1984, you'd have gone, 'No chance'. We were written off.\" \"OK, this is a nostalgia tour,\" adds Hooton. \"But it's also a tour of hope - to say, look, this can happen from nothing.\" Eurovision and Liverpool's wider musical pedigree will now be used to brand it as a music city, not just as Beatles city. Another key moment in Liverpool's regeneration came when it was European Capital of Culture in 2008. \"I don't think anyone would have believed you, pre-Capital of Culture, if you said Liverpool's economy would be run by visitors,\" says Claire McColgan, the council's director of culture. Today, almost half of the council's business rates come from the visitor economy sector, she says. The song contest does have a cost for Liverpool. The council is spending \u00a32m on the event, with another \u00a32m coming from the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Some will question whether that's the best use of public money during a cost of living crisis. McColgan says most in the city now understand that culture can bring big returns. Eurovision is \"an investment into the city's future\", she continues. \"It's investment into jobs, into people wanting to invest here, people wanting to come to college here. It's part of a much bigger picture, and we see it like that here. \"And it's a small investment compared to the return that we're going to get from it. And not just Liverpool - the wider region and also the UK.\" Eurovision has already brought \u00a315m in to the city, McColgan says, while bars and hotels - and souvenir shops - will feel the benefit when the visitors arrive.

        "title": "Ukraine war: How old tech is helping Ukraine avoid detection",
        "content": "As Ukraine prepares for its major offensive, it will only get harder to hide the troop build up from Russia's forces. So Ukraine is having to work out ways to confound the enemy. In a trench on the eastern front, a Ukrainian mortar team knows Russia's not just trying to hunt them down with drones - it's also using electronic warfare to try to locate their position. The men of Ukraine's 28th Brigade may have access to 21st Century technology - satellites, smart phones, and tablets - to help communicate and identify targets. But they're also using a machine from the distant past. An antique that wouldn't look out of place in a trench during World War One: an old wind-up phone. Vlad and his men pick up the field phone whenever they're about to fire a mortar. Its dull ring makes a sound from a bygone era. For outgoing calls, they must wind up a handle. It's like a scene from a black and white movie. Vlad grabs the cables that reach out to other nearby trenches. He says it's the safest means of communication, and that \"it's impossible to listen in\". He says Russian electronic warfare systems can detect and intercept mobile phones and radios, but pointing to his ancient field telephone, Vlad says: \"This technology is very old - but it works really well.\" So far, Russia's conventional forces have performed poorly and suffered heavy losses, but it still has some of the world's most advanced electronic warfare systems - the invisible means to track an enemy and to intercept or block communications. In fixed defensive positions they'll make Ukrainian advances more dangerous and difficult. Russia's Zoopark radars can locate artillery fire. Its Zhitel vehicles detect, track and block radio frequencies, while the Borisoglebsk-2 can disrupt satellite communications like GPS. Russia's use of electronic warfare is also making it harder for Ukraine's army of drones - key to getting a bird's eye view of the battlefield. At another location on the eastern front, Oleksii and his drone intelligence unit of the 59th Brigade use the cover of a bombed out building to fly their small Chinese commercial drone to identify Russian positions. In the early stages of the war, Ukraine appeared to be more adept in their use. But Oleksii says now \"the sky is full of drones\". He says the Russians, too, are using the same models, but have more of them. Though he believes they \"care less about them\". Oleksii says he's already lost five small Chinese-made drones and his Brigade \"might lose three to four drones a day\". He says the enemy have access to radio-electronic warfare stations and anti-drone guns which \"can transmit interference and interrupt communications\" to disable their drones. But in skilful hands, he adds, a small commercial drone like a Mavic can last \"between two and three weeks\". They try their best to avoid detection - using encryption and altering their drone's geolocation. The one he's flying over Russian trenches is using a VPN in Australia, meaning it appears to be flying around the southern continent. But he says the disguise doesn't always work. In contrast, Ukraine's efforts to bring down Russian drones can be more rudimentary - as we witnessed at another position. Ukrainian troops point to a drone flying high in the distance. It's an Orlan - a larger, Russian-made drone that can carry out surveillance or intercept communications. This time it's scouting out nearby Ukrainian defensive positions to direct artillery fire. We hear the whizz of the shells before seeing the impact and smoke rising in the distance. The response of the nearby Ukrainian troops is to open up with a hail of bullets toward the sky, fired from their automatic rifles. But the Russian drone is too high. In this instance, their gunfire is futile. In a nearby command centre, Bohdan, of Ukraine's 10th Brigade, expresses his frustration that they can't do more. He says Russian drones are flying \"every day, every hour, every second. They have the resources for that. We fight against it but not as much as we'd like.\" The large screen behind him though shows that Ukraine is still able to do the same - even if they must now consider their drones as expendable items of war. We watch a live video feed from a Ukrainian drone hovering over nearby trenches. Russia may have the advantage in electronic warfare and more drones - they'll provide a challenge for Ukraine's coming offensive. But Russia has not yet been able to gain control of the skies, or defeat Ukrainian resistance and ingenuity.",

        "title": "New York subway passenger died after chokehold",
        "content": "The New York City medical examiner has ruled a subway passenger was killed by a chokehold after a fight with another passenger that was caught on camera. Officials say Jordan Neely's death was caused by homicide, from \"compression of neck [chokehold]\". Video of the incident shows Mr Neely, 30, struggling as another man grabs him and holds him on the ground. Police have questioned and released the 24-year-old US Marine who restrained the passenger. Homicide means a death caused by another person, but is not necessarily a murder. It is now up to police and prosecutors to determine if charges are warranted. \"As part of our rigorous ongoing investigation, we will review the Medical Examiner's report, assess all available video and photo footage, identify and interview as many witnesses as possible, and obtain additional medical records,\" a spokesman for Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement following the ruling. \"This investigation is being handled by senior, experienced prosecutors and we will provide an update when there is additional public information to share,\" he added. The incident happened on Monday afternoon on the F-line train in the SoHo section of Manhattan. On Wednesday, a rally for Mr Neely was held on the train platform near to where he died. \"Justice for Jordan Neely,\" the crowd chanted, according to CBS. \"If we don't get it, shut it down.\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams urged the public to be patient and allow the investigation to determine all of the facts. \"There are so many unknowns at this time,\" he told CNN. \"We cannot just blanketly say what a passenger should or shouldn't do in a situation like that,\" he added. A video captured by a freelance journalist on the train shows the former Marine holding the 30-year-old man - who was said to have been acting erratically - around the neck for two minutes and 55 seconds. Two other riders are also seen restraining his arms. All three later let go of the man, who is then seen lying motionless on the floor. Police sources told BBC's US news partner CBS that the man who died was throwing rubbish and yelling at passengers. Mr Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator and was living on the streets, according to US media. Officers arrived at the scene at about 14:27 local time (19:27 BST) and found the man unresponsive. He was later taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Juan Alberto Vazquez, the freelance journalist who filmed the incident, told the New York Times that the deceased man was screaming on the train before he was restrained. \"'I don't have food, I don't have a drink, I'm fed up,'\" the man screamed, according to Mr Vazquez. \"'I don't mind going to jail and getting life in prison. I'm ready to die.'\" He added the passenger was frightening, but had not assaulted anyone. At the time of the incident, Mr Vasquez said he did not believe the man would die. \"None of us were thinking that,\" he told the New York Times. \"He was moving and he was defending himself.\" New York Governor Kathy Hochul called the video \"deeply disturbing, and that causes a lot of fear for people\". She said the state would work with the city to determine whether homelessness and access to mental health services \"were a factor here\".",

        "title": "US interest rates raised to highest level in 16 years",
        "content": "The US central bank has raised interest rates to the highest level in 16 years as it battles to stabilise prices. The Federal Reserve increased its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points - its 10th hike in 14 months. That pushed its benchmark rate to between 5% and 5.25%, up from near zero in March 2022, although the Fed hinted the rise may be its last one for now. The European Central Bank has also raised rates again, although by a smaller amount than in previous months. The ECB lifted its three key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, whereas the three preceding meetings have all seen a larger rise. In the US, higher rates have sharply raised borrowing costs, spurring a slowdown in sectors such as housing and playing a role in the recent failures of three US banks. \"We're no longer saying that we anticipate\" additional interest rate increases, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said after the announcement, calling it a \"significant change\". However, he refused to rule out further action, saying: \"We'll be driven by incoming data.\" The bank started raising interest rates aggressively last year when prices in the US were soaring at the fastest pace in decades. Higher interest rates make it more expensive to buy a home, borrow to expand a business or take on other debt. By increasing those costs, officials expect demand to fall and prices to cool off. Since the Fed started its campaign, price increases in the US have shown signs of moderating. In March, inflation, the rate at which prices rise, stood at 5% - the lowest level in nearly two years - though still uncomfortably high for the Fed, which is targeting a 2% rate. Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, said he thought the Fed would be \"prudent\" to pause now, noting that the risks to the economy as activity slows are growing. \"The fear of a recession is very much present in the economy today,\" he said. \"I don't think the inflation battle is over, but we are in a situation where we're seeing gradual disinflation and we're also in an environment where interest rates are high and elevated and therefore should be constraining business activity, which should lead to further disinflation in coming months.\" At Ball Chain Manufacturing, a family-owned firm in New York, customers have become more cautious in recent months due to economic worries, says president Bill Taubner. His company has also cut back on replenishing its supplies in response to still-rising prices. But he said his firm did not face imminent borrowing needs and he remained hopeful that any slowdown would be mild and relatively short-lived. \"We realise there is some softness in the marketplace because of inflation and obviously the interest rate issues,\" he said. \"But long term, we're very positive.\" The recent bank failures, and an anticipated pullback in lending as a result, are likely to weigh on the economy, Mr Powell said. But he added that he remained hopeful that the US would avoid a recession, noting that hiring has remained strong and unemployment low. \"I continue to think that it's possible\u2026 that this time is really different,\" he said. The Fed's decision to raise rates on Wednesday was unanimous and widely expected by financial markets, which are looking for clues as to what the bank may do next. In a written statement, the bank scrapped previous guidance it provided in March when it said \"some additional policy firming may be appropriate\" to bring inflation under control. In the press conference, Mr Powell said the bank was \"getting close or maybe even there\" when it came to pausing its rate-hike campaign but was prepared to do more if warranted. Whitney Watson, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said the Fed could still raise rates, depending on what happens in the coming months. \"Inflation is trending in the right direction, but progress has been bumpy,\" she said. \"A pause in rate actions is therefore appropriate, but further tightening is plausible should inflation prove sticky.\" In Europe, the European Central Bank has also been raising rates to try to slow the pace of price increases in the countries that use the euro. Earlier this week, figures showed that eurozone inflation increased in April for the first time in six months. Prices rose at an annual pace of 7%, well above the ECB's target of 2%. On Thursday, the ECB raised its key deposit rate - how much interest it pays on deposits - to 3.25% from 3%. It also lifted its main refinancing rate - how much banks have to pay when they borrow money from the ECB - to 3.75% from 3.5%. However, unlike the US Fed on Thursday, the ECB did not hint that it might have finished with rate rises for now. ECB president Christine Lagarde said the inflation outlook \"continues to be too high for too long\", and speaking to reporters she said: \"We are not pausing - that is very clear.\" Additional reporting by Michelle Fleury, North America business correspondent.",

        "title": "Francisco Oropesa: Texas shooting suspect captured after tip-off",
        "content": "A man suspected of killing five of his neighbours in Texas has been arrested after police found him hiding in a cupboard underneath a pile of laundry. Francisco Oropesa was detained north of Houston. He was several miles from his own home where the shootings happened late on Friday. Mr Oropesa is accused of attacking his neighbours after they allegedly asked him to stop practising with his rifle as the noise was keeping a baby awake. The victims included a nine-year-old. They were all from Honduras, and the country's foreign ministry identified them as Sonia Guzman, 28; Diana Velasquez, 21; Obdulia Molina, 31; Jonathan Caceres, 18, and Daniel Enrique Lazo, nine. The arrest of Mr Oropesa, a 38-year-old Mexican national, brings an end to a four-day manhunt that swept up law enforcement officials across multiple jurisdictions, including the FBI. Drones and scent-tracking dogs were used as police searched an area as far south as the Mexican border. Authorities offered a reward of $80,000 (\u00a364,000) for information leading to his arrest and, on Tuesday, the FBI said Mr Oropesa \"could be anywhere\" as the days-long search failed to yield any leads. But a member of the public contacted the FBI's tip line on Tuesday evening and the suspect was captured just over an hour later near the town of Cut and Shoot, officials said in a news conference. Police have not said who owns the home he was arrested in, but the New York Times reported that property records show it belongs to a relative. \"They can rest easy now, because he is behind bars,\" Sherriff Greg Capers said of the families of the victims. \"He will live out his life behind bars for killing those five.\" The suspect was taken into custody by members of the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, or Bortac, a specialised unit, said Sheriff Capers of San Jacinto County. He will be charged with five counts of murder. The alleged attacker was deported four times between 2009 and 2016, US immigration officials said, although it is unclear on what grounds this happened. An investigation is under way into how the suspect obtained the weapon used in the killings, which was an AR-style rifle. On Wednesday, police said Mr Oropesa's wife had also been arrested. Divimara Lamar Nava, 53, was detained in connection with the Friday night shooting in the small town of Cleveland. Montgomery County Sheriff Rand Henderson said she allegedly hid Mr Oropesa before he was captured by police. She faces the felony charge of hindering the apprehension or prosecution of a known criminal. Also on Wednesday, officials said Mr Oropesa was spotted in Montgomery County - where he was later arrested - on Monday afternoon but managed to evade capture. \"We did confirm that was him on foot, running but we lost track of him. That was not a false alarm. That was him,\" Sheriff's Deputy Tim Kean said. A makeshift memorial with floral tributes, balloons and soft toys has been placed outside the home where the shooting took place.",

        "title": "Nord Stream: Report puts Russian navy ships near pipeline blast site",
        "content": "Russian ships able to perform underwater operations were present near to where explosions later took place on the Nord Stream pipelines, according to an investigative documentary. The vessels were reportedly located using intercepted Russian navy communications. Underwater explosions last September knocked the two Nord Stream pipelines - built to carry gas from Russia to Europe - out of action. The cause of the blasts is unclear. Formal investigations are still taking place in countries close to the blast site. So far, they have said only that they believe the explosions were the result of sabotage rather than any kind of accident. But one possible lead pointing towards Russian involvement has emerged from details of suspicious Russian ship movements in the run-up to the Nord Stream blasts, reported by four Nordic public broadcasters and an accompanying English-language podcast Cold Front. And Denmark's Defence Command has confirmed a separate report that a Danish patrol boat called Nymfen took 26 photos of a Russian submarine-rescue ship in the area days before the explosions. The Information website said the SS-750 had sailed from Kaliningrad and was close to Bornholm island on 22 September 2022. The investigation by Denmark's DR, Norway's NRK, Sweden's SVT, and Finland's Yle focuses on the movements and actions of ships between June and September last year which they describe as highly unusual. The ships are believed to include the Russian naval research vessel Sibiryakov, the tugboat SB-123, and a third ship from the Russian naval fleet that the media outlets have not been able to identify by name. These were so-called \"ghost-ships\", which had their transmitters turned off. The broadcasters, however, say they were able to track their movements, using intercepted radio communications the vessels sent to Russian naval bases. The first vessel departed from a Russian naval base in Kaliningrad before arriving near the pipeline on 7 June. One radio message places it directly above Nord Stream 2 before moving further north, close to the Nord Stream 1 pipelines, spending hours in the area where the pipeline runs about 80m (260ft) below the surface and where some of the leaks would later occur. The Sibiryakov arrived on 14 June and went to the same position as the first vessel, close to Nord Stream, and remained there until the next day. The movements were tracked by a former British naval intelligence officer, who worked on interception of the Russian Baltic Fleet until he retired in 2018. The anonymous officer says he used open-source information and radio communications to carry out his research. He says the pattern of radio communications in June indicated they were in an \"operational phase\" at some points. The tugboat, the SB-123, sailed out to the area on the evening of 21 September. The broadcasters say they intercepted communications that suggest it was operating close to the pipelines and the areas of the explosion from late that evening until around 14:00 on 22 September. The tugboat is also mentioned in the Information story about the SS-750 submarine-rescue ship, which followed up a German report in March of suspected Russian involvement in the area. Satellite imagery examined by the broadcasters is said to support the claims about the unusual routes, and other reports in Germany had claimed it was in the area on 21-22 September. The Sibiryakov is believed to be capable of underwater surveillance and mapping as well as launching a small underwater vehicle. It can be used to support and rescue submarines and has the ability to carry out operations on the seabed, according to experts interviewed by the broadcasters. The Nordic broadcasters do not say there is conclusive proof of what the vessels were up to or that Russia was behind the blast. But the documentary raises questions about the unusual nature of the activity. Last month the series revealed that Russian vessels appeared to be mapping out wind farms in the North Sea, including off the UK coast. Russia has consistently denied any involvement in the blasts. In the immediate aftermath, some in the West pointed the finger at Russia, while Moscow blamed Western countries, including the UK. More recently, there were reports that intelligence pointed towards pro-Ukrainian operatives, although not the Ukrainian government itself.",

        "title": "MasterChef Australia to premiere after host Jock Zonfrillo's death",
        "content": "MasterChef Australia will air its new season on Sunday, six days after the sudden death of one of its hosts, award-winning chef Jock Zonfrillo. The 7 May premiere has the \"full support\" of the 46-year-old Scotsman's family, broadcaster Network 10 said. A tribute show will air one hour before the MasterChef Australia season begins. Zonfrillo was found dead in Melbourne on Monday - the new show was to have aired that night. Police are not treating his death as suspicious. He is survived by his wife Lauren Fried and four children. Glasgow-born Zonfrillo took great pride in mentoring contestants in the high-pressure competition and in the process, he inspired a nation of home cooks, Network 10 said on Wednesday. \"It is with Jock in our hearts that we cherish this season and remember the charismatic and big-hearted judge and chef who we knew and loved,\" the network said. The show was swiftly postponed when news of the chef's death broke. \"I know my heart will break but I'm looking forward to watching Jock's final season. I want to see him mentoring the home cooks and giving some advice to them and watching them grow as pro cooks. That is how I want to remember him,\" one Twitter user said in reply to Network 10's announcement. \"This must have been a really emotionally tough decision for Jock's family. I think I'll need a box of tissues for this one,\" another Twitter user replied. Zonfrillo started hosting MasterChef Australia in 2019, after years of establishing himself in the country's kitchens. He had likened moving to Australia in 2000 to turning a new leaf after battling heroin addiction in his teenage years that made him broke and homeless for a time. He opened up about these struggles in his 2021 memoir, Last Shot. He opened several restaurants in Australia, the most successful of which was Adelaide's award-winning Restaurant Orana, which opened in 2013. However, Orana closed in 2020 and Zonfrillo ended the year with millions of dollars in debt.",

        "title": "Why Tritium Could Be Crucial to Biden\u2019s EV Charger Agenda | TIME",
        "content": "I\nn the wake of federal mandates to phase out gasoline-powered cars, fast chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) are quickly becoming some of the most crucial infrastructure for the U.S. transition away from fossil fuels. And one of the most important manufacturers in that space is an Australian company that few people outside the world of clean tech have heard of. Tritium, a publicly-held company based in Brisbane, has about 6,000 fast chargers deployed in the U.S., according to the company\u2019s data. That\u2019s less than Tesla, the 500-pound gorilla in the EV charging world, which has a network of nearly 7,000 fast chargers around the country and a factory in Buffalo, New York, to keep churning out more. But while Tesla recently started opening a few of its chargers to all EV owners (and plans to make thousands more universally-usable by the end of 2024) most Tesla chargers still only work for the company\u2019s own vehicles. That leaves Tritium holding about 30% of the U.S. market for universal EV chargers, the largest share of any company. It also has the largest U.S.-based factory capacity to build those universal chargers, which will be crucial to picking up lucrative contracts as part of a new $5 billion federal push to build out EV fast chargers. (That effort, introduced under the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, stipulates that the federally-funded fast chargers must be assembled in the United States.) Tritium\u2019s chargers are largely marketed under other brand names, a fact that likely accounts for some of the charging giant\u2019s lack of name recognition. When companies like Shell and ChargePoint build fast charging infrastructure, they have often bought the chargers from Tritium. Tritium\u2019s branding is often visible on the upper part of these charging units. \u201cAre you familiar with \u2018Intel Inside\u2019?\u201d says Mike Calise, president of the company\u2019s Americas division. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2018Tritium on Top.\u2019\u201d Some of the most ballyhood new pushes into EV charging in recent months have relied on Tritium equipment. Tritium is supplying equipment for BP\u2019s push into electric vehicle charging, which involves BP building out airport fast charger hubs for car rental giant Hertz\u2019s transition into electric vehicles. Tritium is also the manufacturer behind rideshare company Revel\u2019s ambitions to build out more than 160 fast charger stalls in New York City by the end of 2023. The charger company has also developed close ties to the Biden Administration. Calise says the company was involved in drafting Transportation Department charger standards after the passage of the infrastructure law in November 2021, which included the $5 billion program for fast charging along highways known as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. The Administration also gave Tritium top billing at a February 2022 White House event on electrifying transportation, touting the company\u2019s plan to open a factory in Lebanon, Tennessee, capable of rolling out 30,000 fast chargers a year. \u201cThe manufacturing facility Tritium announced today is more than just great news for Tennessee,\u201d President Joe Biden said at the time, standing next to a Tritium charger. \u201cThis is great news for workers across the country, for an economy, and, frankly, for the planet.\u201d The facility opened in August of that year. There\u2019s good reason for the President to lavish such attention on the Australian manufacturer. U.S.-built green infrastructure is part of the narrative that Biden is selling to the American people, and Tritium was the kind of story they wanted to highlight. Tritium CEO Jane Hunter says the company was deciding whether to build a factory in Europe or in the U.S. before the passage of the 2021 infrastructure law, but ultimately went with the Tennessee location after the bill\u2019s funding passed. \u201cWe probably couldn\u2019t have been more in the sweet spot of what President Biden was hoping to drive with that strategy,\u201d says Hunter. And, to a certain extent, the Administration\u2019s goal of electrifying American transportation hinges on direct current (DC) fast chargers like those Tritium sells. They\u2019re big, complicated electrical installations, not to be confused with more run of the mill level 2 charger someone might install in their garage. Those level 2 chargers may be convenient for homeowners, but they also take a few hours to charge up an EV. That\u2019s useful for charging during the workday or overnight. But there are a lot of situations where slow charging doesn\u2019t cut it, like on long road trips, or for anyone who doesn\u2019t have their own driveway or parking spot that has a personal EV charging port. The U.S. needs plentiful infrastructure that resembles the current network of gas stations, but for electricity\u2014a place where drivers can stop in, power up a car in a matter of minutes, and be on their way. The system also has to be far easier to navigate than the current hodgepodge of EV charging networks, which is plagued by broken chargers and time-wasting systems requiring customers to load money on network-specific apps to pay for charging. The new infrastructure isn\u2019t cheap, though: the costs for installing a DC charger can run from $28,000 to close to $140,000, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. There\u2019s also a chicken and egg problem for companies that might be interested in building it: they need assurance that there will be enough EVs to use their DC fast chargers so they won\u2019t lose money, but a lot of people may be holding back on switching to EVs without the existence of a reliable extensive network of fast chargers. The government is trying to jump-start that adoption cycle, and Tritium, for its part, is well positioned to get in on the game. In February, the Transportation Department released a final rule laying out expectations for the NEVI system, mandating that new chargers can\u2019t be out of order more than 3% of the time on average, and that the chargers accept major credit cards without using an app. They also have to meet a certain minimum charging speed, and be manufactured and assembled in the United States. Tritium says it has a fast charging system that meets those requirements, announcing the product offering in March. Federal funding started making its way to states last fall, and the charging dollars will likely end up in the hands of multiple charger manufacturers. But Calise says Tritium will likely be in pole position\u2014it has enough manufacturing capacity at the Tennessee facility to supply the entire program for all 50 states. \u201cThat\u2019s not daunting to us,\u201d says Calise. \u201cWe need way more fast chargers than NEVI [will build]. We\u2019re planning on that. That\u2019s our market.\u201d Correction, May 16 The original version of this article misstated whether ChargePoint purchases Tritium chargers. Chargepoint has purchased chargers from Tritium in the past, but does not currently.",

        "title": "What Is Orienteering? And Why It's So Good for You | Time",
        "content": "If getting lost in the woods sounds like fun to you, you\u2019d love orienteering. The sport involves navigating through unfamiliar terrain, often in a forest, to locations circled on a detailed topographic map. (These spots are typically marked by a flag, and participants record proof that they were there, sometimes with a small electronic device.) You can only use your map and a compass\u2014no smartphones or GPS\u2014to guide the way. Rather than following one specified route, people need to figure out what path makes the most sense, while maneuvering around obstacles like bodies of water, hills, or boulders. While it\u2019s still under-the-radar in the U.S., thousands of spectators and participants consistently attend events throughout Europe. Orienteers\u2014who range in age from children to seniors\u2014show up to have adventurous fun, meet new friends in a beautiful setting, and enjoy a variety of mental and physical health benefits. Research suggests orienteering contributes to enhanced fitness (by improving aerobic capacity, flexibility, and speed), lower levels of psychological distress, and better brain health. \u201cWe brand it as a sport for life, because it\u2019s adaptable to your skill and physical abilities,\u201d says Emma Waddington, a graduate student in kinesiology at McMaster University in Canada who conducted a recent study about orienteering\u2019s impact on the brain. She\u2019s also an athlete on the Canadian National Orienteering Team, traveling the globe to compete in races. \u201cI saw these older adults out there and I was like, \u2018What are they doing differently that allows them to be engaging in such a cognitively demanding sport at such an old age, when we typically see declines in spatial skills and memory?\u2019\u201d Waddington\u2019s study, published in January in PLOS One, suggests the sport could help fight or prevent age-related cognitive decline in spatial navigation and memory. After surveying 158 people ages 18 to 87, the researchers concluded that orienteering \u201cmay be more beneficial than physical activity alone.\u201d That\u2019s because exercising while navigating activates the parts of the brain our ancestors used for hunting and gathering\u2014but which are largely dormant now as people rely on GPS to find their way around. While it\u2019s convenient, such technology could be doing the brain a disservice. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to our roots, rehearsing the spatial tasks that we don\u2019t get to do much anymore,\u201d Waddington says. And you don\u2019t have to spend much time doing it to benefit: \u201cA little goes a long way.\u201d In early data, her team is finding that even a one-time, 15-minute orienteering session might lead to gains in cognitive function. If your interest is piqued, Waddington and other experts recommend reaching out to a local club; there\u2019s at least one in most states. Orienteering events typically consist of three or more courses with varying lengths and difficulty, so even newcomers can show up, get a quick lesson, and test out a beginner route. It could take anywhere from 15 minutes to a couple hours to complete. \u201cYour goal is to navigate a series of checkpoints as fast and efficiently as possible,\u201d Waddington says. \u201cYou\u2019re moving through difficult terrain while trying to relate the information you\u2019re gathering from the map to what you can see in front of you.\u201d That\u2019s why orienteering is often called \u201cthe thinking sport\u201d\u2014it\u2019s like solving a puzzle. Almost anyone can give orienteering a whirl, says Ian Shields, 74, who\u2019s a member of Backwoods Orienteering Klub in Raleigh, N.C. Aside from the welcoming and inclusive atmosphere, it\u2019s affordable: Participants usually pay about $7 to register for one of his club\u2019s events, which includes the cost of a map, and then an extra $5 for a finger stick, a small electronic device that records your start and finish times. He suggests bringing water and a safety whistle, and wearing hiking gear and insect repellent. Read More: Rock Climbing Is a Thrill. It\u2019s Also Really Good for You Shields has lost some of his vision since taking up the sport more than a decade ago, but that hasn\u2019t dampened his enjoyment; he simply uses a larger map now. He regularly orienteers with people who are under 10 and over 95. \u201cYou can compete against a buddy who runs the same level of course as you do, or against your previous record,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can try and be the fastest in the whole group, or the slowest.\u201d He\u2019s not particularly speedy\u2014he jokes that the only way he\u2019ll win a race is if he outlives all his peers\u2014but he\u2019s OK with that. There\u2019s no pressure in orienteering. \u201cWe have one lady who comes out and spends more time photographing the flowers, and sometimes she finishes the course and sometimes she doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says. The benefits are clear regardless. \u201cIt keeps your brain working. I\u2019m certainly benefiting from it, because I actually get out and do something.\u201d Orienteering is like forest bathing, but with an athletic twist, says Clinton Morse, 61, who lives in Connecticut. He\u2019s been orienteering since the mid-90s and loves the sport so much, he retired early a few years ago to dedicate more time to it. He\u2019s now the national communications manager for Orienteering USA, the governing body for the sport in the U.S. Morse has orienteered in eight states so far this year. \u201cThere\u2019s a really good feeling to it,\u201d he says, including a satisfying mental challenge. Some newcomers worry about getting lost, but as long as you start out on a beginner course and learn the sport\u2019s basic tenets, you\u2019ll be fine, he says. \u201cThen you add intuition, and you can basically infer things from the map.\u201d Paige Suhocki, who\u2019s 15 and lives in New Jersey, started orienteering when she was 10. She was recently selected to represent TeamUSA at the Junior World Orienteering Championships this summer in Romania. \u201cThere\u2019s so many different ages of people,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are kids younger than me, and there are old ladies still going out there and walking it. I aspire to be them, because they\u2019re getting out in nature and getting exercise.\u201d (Plus, she adds, sometimes the older people beat the high-school kids, \u201cbecause they know exactly where they\u2019re going.\u201d) Suhocki believes orienteering has improved her mental and physical health in a variety of ways, including helping her learn to make decisions quickly. She\u2019s on the track and cross-country teams at school, but hasn\u2019t always relished running. When she\u2019s navigating an orienteering course, however, she doesn\u2019t even notice how many miles she\u2019s logged. \u201cI just go out, have fun, and I look at my watch after and I\u2019ve done five or six miles,\u201d she says. One day, when she\u2019s older, she\u2019ll make it a family tradition: \u201cI definitely want to get my kids into it. It\u2019s great to have something to look forward to on the weekends.\u201d",

        "title": "What Might Be Next for Misoprostol, the Other Abortion Pill",
        "content": "The abortion pill mifepristone has been on uncertain legal ground ever since a Texas judge ruled that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2019s approval more than two decades ago should be suspended. After the Department of Justice appealed the decision and requested that the Supreme Court step in, the high court decided that mifepristone should remain available while courts continue to decide its legal fate in a potentially lengthy appeals process. With one abortion pill in legal limbo, experts are now worried about possible threats to the other one: misoprostol. The drug is FDA approved to treat ulcers and, when used with mifepristone, to induce abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Taking the pills together is more effective and linked to fewer side effects than using misoprostol alone. In many parts of the world, however, doctors use misoprostol alone for abortions. Health-care providers can still use misoprostol on its own for abortions or to manage miscarriages in what\u2019s called \u201coff-label\u201d use, a common practice that allows them to prescribe any approved drug for purposes other than those for which they are indicated. If mifepristone loses its status as an approved drug, or if its use is restricted, misoprostol could become the only option for medication abortion\u2014and the next abortion battlefield. The unprecedented legal challenge to one abortion pill shows how the other might be similarly vulnerable. While misoprostol\u2019s approval as an ulcer drug is unlikely to come under legal threat, its use in abortion might. If that happens, aggressive prosecutors might decide to criminally charge people who travel to other states to take the pill. (The same could also happen to people obtaining mifepristone should that drug become restricted.) \u201cThere are laws that can be used to go after people who have had self-managed abortions claiming that it\u2019s fetal harm or child abuse,\u201d says Liz Borkowski, managing director of the Jacobs Institute of Women\u2019s Health at George Washington University. \u201cThat depends on prosecutors and how far out on a limb they want to go with this.\u201d Just as plaintiffs brought a case against the FDA questioning the approval of mifepristone, parties could begin to challenge the FDA\u2019s regulation of off-label use\u2014not only for misoprostol, but for any drug, says Lawrence Gostin, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law at Georgetown Law. \u201cIf the challenge to mifepristone is successful, it could open the floodgates to litigation against other drugs,\u201d he says. For health-care providers, that would be devastating. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely concerning when politics supersedes health decisions that are best left to the patient and provider relationship,\u201d says Dr. Umair Shah, secretary of health for Washington state. \u201cToday it\u2019s mifepristone; tomorrow it could be vaccines, and then Narcan, and before we know it, it\u2019s everything.\u201d Read More: Abortion Rights Benefit People Who Want Kids, Too Though misoprostol is not currently being challenged, states in which abortion is legal are trying to pre-emptively protect it. Some Democratic governors\u2014including in California and New York\u2014are stockpiling the drug to preserve access to medication abortions. Having supplies of the drug on hand could avoid any potential restrictions, especially on shipping the medication between states, that could come. Officials in many states are also \u201cmaking moves to say they won\u2019t cooperate with investigations of providers and patients who use misoprostol,\u201d says Borkowski. \u201cA lot of states are stepping up and putting protections in place recognizing that this is probably coming.\u201d In the aftermath of the Texas judge\u2019s ruling, for example, Washington state\u2019s legislature passed a shield law that prohibits cooperation when Washington health-care professionals are charged with out-of-state criminal and civil cases related to abortion, which the governor is expected to sign into law. It also passed a law prohibiting copays for any abortion care, bolstering an existing state law that requires state plans to cover abortion services if they cover maternity care. Such protections are an extension of those that many Democratic governors passed by executive order after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, protecting providers who perform medication abortions for people who travel from states where abortion is illegal. Even so, additional safety nets might be required to insulate misoprostol\u2019s use in abortion. New York governor Kathy Hochul proposed legislation in New York that requires private insurance companies to cover misoprostol when it is used in abortion; she is also taking additional steps to protect doctors who prescribe misoprostol by discouraging higher malpractice rates for them. In Washington state, legislators passed a bill assuring that reproductive health-care services, including abortion, are recognized as part of health-care providers\u2019 professional duties and not subject to any disciplinary measures under the state\u2019s licensing regulations. The bill is awaiting the governor\u2019s signature. While the legal fights continue, Shah\u2019s biggest concern is for \u201cthe impact and precedent this sets for other kinds of medications,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just don\u2019t, as a nation, want to go back to letting politics get in the mix of health decisions.\u201d",

        "content": "Deepika Padukone never set out to take India to the world. She wanted the world to come to India. As the most popular actress in the world\u2019s most populous country, she\u2019s often asked if she\u2019s going to move to Hollywood. \u201cMy mission has always been to make a global impact while still being rooted in my country,\u201d she says on her home turf in Mumbai one humid morning in April, while on a break from shooting India\u2019s first aerial-action film, Fighter. It\u2019s fitting that Padukone\u2019s photo shoot for this story is happening inside Mehboob Studios, home to some of the most legendary movies made in Hindi-language cinema, from the seminal Oscar-nominated Mother India in 1957 to Padukone\u2019s own Chennai Express in 2013. The 37-year-old is now a legend in her own right. She has appeared in more than 30 films, won numerous awards, and generated nearly $350 million in global box-office revenues. Today, she is the highest-paid actress in India. Among her legions of fans and nearly 74 million followers on Instagram, Padukone is fondly called the Queen of Bollywood. Read More: How India\u2019s Record-Breaking Population Will Shape the World Padukone\u2019s 16-year career is an exception to the rule in Bollywood, the cutthroat Hindi-language film industry, known for prizing youth and continually looking for the next new thing. She suspects this has to do with India\u2019s growing influence in the world. \u201cIndian cinema has transcended borders and Indians are everywhere, so the fame goes wherever you go,\u201d she says. Buy a print of the Deepika Padukone cover here Smartphones, streaming services, and social media have helped find new audiences for India\u2019s century-old film industry, which tells about 1,500 stories a year on the screen. At the same time, Netflix and Amazon are also eager to create content that caters to a vast South Asian viewership of nearly 2 billion people around the world. But they are not necessarily looking only at Bollywood. The recent success of Telugu-language films like Bahubali and RRR has forced the question of whether Bollywood can still dominate the Indian film industry (which comprises many regional languages). All the while, tensions simmer under the surface as a rightward-leaning Indian government monitors the stories India tells about itself on celluloid. Padukone has been at the crossroads of all these forces, but remains unfazed. After all, she grew up in the enterprising city of Bangalore\u2014known as the Silicon Valley of India, and now called Bengaluru\u2014at a time when India was undergoing economic liberalization. Vijay Subramaniam, Padukone\u2019s agent, says she represents the \u201ctypical Bangalore girl\u201d\u2014someone with the world at their fingertips. In Padukone, we see a quiet trailblazer who makes her own rules, all the while embodying the feminine ideal that Bollywood wants to romance. She has emerged from the hopes and dreams of modern Indian women: someone with the utmost freedom to choose how she lives, works, and rests. Earlier this year, she charmed audiences at the 95th Academy Awards by introducing \u201cNaatu Naatu,\u201d the Oscar winner for Best Original Song from the movie RRR, as a \u201ctotal banger\u201d; she served on the exclusive jury for the 75th Cannes Film Festival; and she became the first Indian brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton and Cartier. She regularly makes fashion waves during her appearances at global events like the Met Gala and red carpets. At the shoot, Padukone arrives early, sending the production crew into a frenzy. She\u2019s surrounded by four bodyguards, two agents, two personal photographers, a stylist, makeup and hair artists, and a few more assistants. She poses effortlessly in front of the camera while her personally curated playlist blasts in the background, before her husband\u2014the larger-than-life Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh\u2014stops by the studio to surprise her. He\u2019s interrupting her while she\u2019s at work, but she giggles as the two hold hands for a brief moment. We head to the Taj Lands End hotel after the shoot, where we enter through a special entrance roped off for Padukone. She wants to gaze at the Arabian Sea while we talk, but the apologetic hotel staff informs her that our private room is on the other side, overlooking a construction site. She\u2019s OK with that, she tells them with a smile, and promptly asks her entourage to leave. Right now, her life is a lot. Sitting cross-legged on a couch, she contemplates her success. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a game plan for how to get here, but I didn\u2019t see failure on my vision board,\u201d she says. While she feels fulfilled, she\u2019s also trying to figure out what\u2019s next. \u201cThis is India\u2019s moment,\u201d she says. \u201cSo how can I marry the best of the East and the West?\u201d Twenty-one-year-old Padukone parades down a red carpet in slow motion in a wistful romantic sequence. She\u2019s wearing a magenta lehenga-choli, a slick bombshell bun, and full-winged eyeliner drawn to precision with killer dimples to match. It\u2019s her first Hindi film, Om Shanti Om, a campy, madcap spoof of \u201970s Bollywood, and Padukone has been cast alongside Shah Rukh Khan, one of the biggest superstars in the world. Nevertheless, she manages to hold her own. Khan, who co-produced the film, concedes that when he first met Padukone, he wasn\u2019t sure if she could pull off the role. Still, there was a sense that she was on the verge of becoming a star. \u201cEverybody knew it,\u201d he says. Om Shanti Om broke box-office records, and the two have gone on to star in four more films together. In January, they appeared in the spy thriller Pathaan, which quickly became one of the highest-grossing Hindi films of all time, earning $100 million globally. Another collaboration, Jawan, is in the pipeline for release later this year. For Khan, working with Padukone is like \u201cworking with family.\u201d Padukone might have been propelled into the limelight after Om Shanti Om, but she did not have a smooth ride. She was a complete outsider in Bollywood, where simmering tensions over nepotism finally exploded during the pandemic, fueling a reckoning with the advantages afforded to children of actors, producers, and directors who make it in the industry with ease. Meanwhile, Padukone didn\u2019t grow up thinking she would even become an actor. She was born in Denmark to Ujjala Padukone, a travel agent, and Prakash Padukone, a world-champion badminton player widely credited with putting India on the map in the sport. She played badminton herself on a national level, before leaving home at 16 to pursue modeling on the runways of Mumbai. \u201cFrom my story so far, there\u2019s nothing that indicates that I would have anything to do with the movies,\u201d she says. \u201cThe weird thing is that the few times a year my family watched a movie, I felt a connection. Like that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to be one day.\u201d  Where her debut film lent security and protection\u2014precisely because of its star power\u2014what followed next was a period of mistakes. Her choices were questioned after her next few movies struggled at the box office, and critics saw her acting as mediocre at best. Padukone is quick to accept the criticism, but also points out that \u201cin those years is this girl who was touted as the next big thing, but actually, she was only just figuring her way out.\u201d Anupama Chopra, a renowned Hindi film critic, says she began seeing an evolution in Padukone\u2019s acting with films like Cocktail (2012), Chennai Express (2013), and Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram Leela (2013). It culminated with Piku (2015), perhaps her most memorable film, an unconventional comedy heavy on bathroom humor. \u201cYou sort of took a step back and thought, oh my god, when did this happen?\u201d says Chopra. \u201cShe showed the world that it didn\u2019t matter how pretty you were or how many brands you represented, it was all about what you did in front of that camera.\u201d Read More: Bollywood Wages a Battle for Hearts and Minds In 2017, she dipped her toes into Hollywood, starring alongside Vin Diesel in xXx: Return of Xander Cage, an experience that allowed her to push different boundaries. \u201cWe speak in English all the time, but to act in English for the first time was so weird,\u201d she reflects. But her bankability as a star has also been met with fierce opposition, after the conservative Hindu-nationalist turn in Indian politics in the past decade. It first spiked in 2016, when she starred in Padmaavat, a maximalist period drama about a Hindu queen who becomes the object of infatuation of the Muslim Sultan of Delhi. Rumors of a love scene between the two characters drove Hindu vigilantes to light the film set on fire, while an official from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) offered a bounty of $1.5 million for Padukone\u2019s beheading, horrifying spectators. Local police detained the official. In 2020, Padukone was spotted standing silently at a student protest against an anti-Muslim citizenship law at New Delhi\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru University. Bollywood stars don\u2019t traditionally speak up or protest, so what Padukone did was a rare\u2014and risky\u2014example of a public figure calling out the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And in January came the \u201csaffron\u201d bikini attack over Pathaan\u2014when a Hindu-nationalist minister objected to Padukone\u2019s wearing an orange-colored bikini in a musical sequence. (Orange is considered a sacred color in Hinduism and has been adopted as a symbol for Hindu nationalists.) But Padukone is relieved to say she was genuinely missing in action when the controversy exploded days before the film\u2019s release\u2014she was simply busy at work. Padukone has remained studiously silent about these controversies, which haven\u2019t deterred her from taking up any roles\u2014including the role of a Pakistani spy in Pathaan. A long pause follows when she is asked about the constant political backlash. Padukone then says, carefully, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to feel something about it. But the truth is, I don\u2019t feel anything about it.\u201d India may be living in a \u201cpolarized cultural climate,\u201d says Chopra, but Bollywood\u2019s real crisis is one of storytelling and content. \u201cBollywood has lost its place,\u201d says the critic. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis of making better Hindi cinema that connects with the rest of the country,\u201d she continues, nodding to the perception that South Indian movies have, of late, better captured the zeitgeist than those being made in Mumbai. Last year, Padukone served on the eight-member jury of the 75th Cannes Film Festival, tasked with announcing the winner of the coveted Palme d\u2019Or award. Part of her job entailed \u201ceducating everyone around me that Indian movies are more than just song and dance,\u201d she says. But the opportunity equally made Padukone reflect on Bollywood\u2019s place in the world. She spent the two weeks in Cannes wondering why more Indian films weren\u2019t being showcased on a global stage. \u201cI would say that Hindi cinema has evolved, but we still have a long way to go,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we had a better moment?\u201d Until last year, no Indian film had won an Oscar, despite the Indian film industry\u2019s entertaining billions of people. Only three Indian films have been nominated for Best International Feature Film. Now, with the recognition of more diverse content, Padukone says India itself is beginning to realize that its movies are not just limited to Hindi films. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we should be happy with one Oscar for a song and one Oscar for a documentary,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope we can look at this as the beginning of an opportunity.\u201d With global superstardom at her doorstep, Padukone is aware of the importance of not losing sight of herself along the way. She is eager to be as authentic as possible\u2014which has also meant being honest with herself, and the world, about her personal challenges. In 2015, she became one of the few Bollywood actors to come out publicly about her struggle with depression. It surprised everyone around her, especially since she was at the peak of her career, having delivered three hits in a single year. In a country where the stigma around mental health hangs heavy and resources for treatment remain scarce, the admission had every potential to end her career. \u201cBut when I spoke about it, it just felt extremely liberating,\u201d she says. Padukone founded the Live Love Laugh foundation, now headed by her sister, which works with local communities to create awareness and access to mental-health resources. This year, she also launched her own cosmetics brand, 82\u00b0E, with the goal to talk about self-care more broadly. Her actions have opened up conversations about mental health across India, where an estimated 56 million people suffer from depression. \u201cA lot of other celebrities have spoken about [mental health] since then, but more importantly, a lot of noncelebrities have also spoken about it,\u201d says Anisha, her sister. \u201cThis is an illness that doesn\u2019t discriminate.\u201d Read More: Netflix\u2019s The Romantics Aims to Give Bollywood the Homage It Deserves Padukone is grateful for the support she has received over the years while laying bare her anxieties\u2014especially from her fans. \u201cThe beautiful part is that millions of them will probably never meet me, but they\u2019re still on the journey of life with me,\u201d she says. \u201cThey understand my body language, my expressions, my silences.\u201d At the same time, her drive for authenticity has made her conscious of not changing in the eyes of those closest to her. \u201cI will also give myself a little bit of credit that for whatever reason, I\u2019ve been able to keep myself grounded,\u201d she says. And then there\u2019s her husband Singh, who ripples through Bollywood wearing quirky outfits in public, playing pranks on his co-stars, occasionally posing nude for a shoot\u2014and always making Padukone laugh. The two have just returned from a holiday in Bhutan, where they spent their days doing what Padukone enjoys most: going on walks, sightseeing, and eating. With him, she is her \u201cmost vulnerable self,\u201d she says. Not long ago, Bollywood actresses came with a shelf life that expired as soon as they got married or had children. But that\u2019s changed, Padukone insists. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that experience because [Singh] has always put me, my dreams, and my ambitions first.\u201d Padukone married Singh in a private celebration in Lake Como, Italy, in 2018. The couple held two intricate Hindu ceremonies\u2014a Konkani ceremony nodding to Padukone\u2019s South Indian roots, and a Sikh ceremony that honored Singh\u2019s North Indian traditions. The wedding may have been small, but its glamour quotient was high. Padukone tapped India\u2019s most famous designer, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, to dress the couple. Being a Sabyasachi bride was a savvy move for a fashion icon like Padukone\u2014even today, the power couple\u2019s nuptials remain one of the most double-tapped posts on Instagram, inspiring the wedding aesthetics of Indian couples who form a $50 billion-strong wedding market. The payoff for dominating Instagram, as Padukone has time and again, is enormous, both for her and the companies that hire her. BoF reported the Bollywood star accounted for seven of Louis Vuitton\u2019s top 10 Instagram posts, generating more than 25% of the brand\u2019s $20.2 million in media impact value during the Cannes Film Festival, according to data analytics and marketing agency Launchmetrics. A single Instagram post of Padukone in a floor-sweeping red Louis Vuitton gown garnered more than 2 million likes and generated more than a million dollars in media impact value. The endorsements go on and on\u2014Levi\u2019s, Adidas, L\u2019Oreal, and Tissot\u2014brands that see Padukone as their gateway to a growing Indian market that was previously thwarted by bureaucracy. In April, Dior hosted its first official show in the country, near the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. But beyond weddings and luxury clothing brands, India\u2014the world\u2019s most populous nation with 1.4 billion people\u2014will soon become the world\u2019s third largest apparel and footwear market, predicted to be worth more than $83 billion by 2025, according to data from Euromonitor. If brands want to capitalize on a \u201cnew India,\u201d which Padukone calls simply \u201can emotion,\u201d she knows that stardom has placed her at its fulcrum. \u201cThere\u2019s the India with our roots, our heritage, our history, but there\u2019s also a new and young India that\u2019s emerging.\u201d It\u2019s almost time to go. In a few minutes, she will slip out the special exit with her bodyguards. \u201cIt\u2019s these two Indias coming together,\u201d she says, \u201cthat I find really fascinating at this moment.\u201d Correction, May 11 The original version of this article misstated Vijay Subramaniam\u2019s role. He is Padukone\u2019s agent, not her manager. Styling by Shaleena Nathani; Hair by Yianni Tsapatori; Makeup by Anil Chinnappa; Production by Keyur Lakhani at Imran Khatri Productions",

        "title": "Comer Swings and Misses on Allegations of Influence Peddling",
        "content": "House Oversight Committee chair James Comer aired details Wednesday of foreign business dealings by companies that he alleges benefited members of President Joe Biden\u2019s family during and after the years that Biden was Vice President. Comer provided evidence at a press conference that the companies received more than $10 million from foreign nationals and entities. He and other Republicans described wire transfers from those companies to several of Joe Biden\u2019s relatives, including to his son Hunter Biden, and said that the payments appeared to be unconnected to work done by the family members. Comer and his GOP colleagues on the House Oversight Committee further alleged that the payments, which included some from a Romanian national and a Chinese entity, constitute a \u201cpattern of influence peddling.\u201d They provided no evidence of President Biden\u2019s knowledge of the transactions and made no attempt to link the payments to any of his official or unofficial acts as a public servant. The House Republicans\u2019 press conference comes weeks after Joe Biden formally launched his campaign for a second term and is part of a broader effort to make questions around the business dealings of his son, Hunter, an issue in the 2024 election. Hunter Biden is also reportedly the subject of criminal investigations by the U.S. attorney in Delaware into his tax filings and a statement he made on a form to purchase a handgun. The declared purpose of the Comer investigation is to probe \u201cthe President\u2019s role in his family members\u2019 and business associates foreign and domestic business practices.\u201d To date, Comer has uncovered none. That isn\u2019t stopping the Kentucky Republican from continuing to try. The chair said he would soon issue a new round of subpoenas to banks and give certain associates of President Biden\u2019s relatives one more chance to voluntarily testify. He added that the Oversight Committee had asked the FBI to hand over by noon on Wednesday investigative records, known internally as an FD-1023 document, that allegedly related to Biden. Comer and Senator Chuck Grassley have said they learned about the document from a \u201chighly credible whistleblower.\u201d \u201cIf the FBI does not comply with our subpoena, then Sen. Grassley and I will discuss the next step,\u201d Comer said. Comer also specified the nine Biden relatives whom he alleges received payments, including Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, Biden\u2019s brother, James, and others. The new details build on Comer\u2019s months-long investigation of Hunter Biden and the president\u2019s son\u2019s business dealings in China and Ukraine. The facts so far suggest that Hunter Biden may have tried to profit off of his famous name, but there is no evidence that his dealings influenced his father\u2019s policy decisions or that President Biden ever made any money off of them. \u201cThe DOJ needs to get off its ass and investigate,\u201d South Carolina Representative Nancy Mace said on Wednesday. \u201cIf there are anti-corruption laws that need to be made stronger, we will also do that.\u201d Asked about whether the committee would apply similar investigative pressure to the business dealings of the children of former President Trump, Comer said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at everything when we get ready to introduce the legislation to ban influence peddling.\u201d Ahead of the press conference, the White House released a memo accusing Comer of \u201cusing baseless claims, personal attacks, and innuendo to try to score political points.\u201d But Comer sees it differently. \u201cI think the American people understand that this stinks and I think they appreciate what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Growing up a Third Culture kid between Dolly Parton\u2019s Knoxville, Tenn., late-90s Shanghai, and 2000s Southern California engineers a unique loneliness. After all, when you belong to so many places, do you belong anywhere? But as my single mother once said: When you can\u2019t come home, you build your own.  Yet, despite our ostensive misalignment and our continued need to combat hate aimed at Asian Pacific communities, our diaspora has seen a golden wave of cultural and economic progress\u2014that has broken records and defined industries in short order. May 1st marks the beginning of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month. Each year, to spotlight the Asian Pacific diaspora\u2019s most impactful societal contributions, Gold House releases the A100\u2014our own TIME100. This year, journalist Alex Wagner, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, actor Ke Huy Quan, fashion designer Anna Sui, and baseball player Shohei Ohtani all made the list, which covers industries ranging from politics to business to entertainment to fashion to sports.   Media representation became the unifying battleground through , the first Asian-led major studio project in 25 years. In 2018, many studio executives did not believe that Asians were a viable market\u2014partly due to our 7% domestic population at the time. But by adapting successful galvanization models by Black churches in the late 80s and from women in the 2000s, several industry leaders jumpstarted with a promotional engine now known as , using theater buyouts and other viral tactics to guarantee that . Since then, #GoldOpen has ensured the opening weekend success of more than two dozen Asian-led films including, most recently, Everything Everywhere All At Once. Prioritizing market viability isn\u2019t new. Creators can come from anywhere but haven\u2019t always been able to go everywhere. Marketing has always been half the battle\u2014most easily evidenced by its percentage of total theatrical release budgets. YouTube was and continues to be the bastion for minority creators to reach the mainstream. In 2010, for instance, 25% of YouTube\u2019s top categories were Asian-led; accessible bandwidth and ubiquitous smart device distribution gave permission to niche creation. Beyond YouTube, a conducted by Nielsen and Gold House indicated that streaming platforms like Netflix have twice the AANHPIs of broadcast programs. And, of course, there\u2019s K-pop, whose listening share grew 65% annually since 2015 on Spotify and Apple Music and even more during the pandemic.   ",

        "content": "In her novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, the anthropologist turned storyteller Zora Neale Hurston wrote that there are years that ask questions and those that answer them.  Fifty years later, in the final weeks of 2022, one data point suggested the remain-and-influence strategy had its merits: Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, was elected the first Black House Minority Leader, making him the first Black person to lead a major party\u2019s caucus in either chamber of Congress. Read more: \u201cHakeem, in some ways, is an heir of all of that,\u201d says historian Komozi Woodard, author of Want to Start a Revolution?, speaking of the Gary meeting and what followed, especially the movement of grassroots Black activists into electoral politics in places like Jeffries\u2019 hometown of Brooklyn, N.Y..   Americans will no doubt hear Tuesday lots of talk about Jeffries\u2019 relatively rapid rise during his decade in Congress, an institution that Spencer Overton, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, says is one in which seniority typically dominates. But Jeffries\u2019 rise, Overton tells me, comes as no surprise to those who have been some like to call . Jeffries, 52, comes from socially and politically engaged people, and was a feature of the New York civil-rights scene during his career as a corporate lawyer. He brings a GenXer\u2019s ability to walk in many worlds, physical and digital, and, having come of age during some of the most difficult decades in America\u2019s major cities, he is part of what Woodard describes as the hip-hop generation\u2014a group skilled at making a way out of no way. Read more:  In fact, research and political experience tell us that get there precisely because of their facility for what their supporters call consensus building and their detractors are more likely to describe as accommodation. Others more rigid in their ideas about policy and process risk offending those who like things the way they are. leaders are most often installed in times of crisis, making leadership even more challenging and success at least a little less likely. And there remains the simple fact that just because a barrier has been broken, doesn\u2019t mean that everyone is happy about it.   \u201cLike President Obama, the image of Hakeem Jeffries, leader, could represent to some that they are losing what they think is their country\u2014as opposed to , in the collective sense, country,\u201d says Overton, who is also a professor at George Washington University\u2019s Law School. Look out, he and several other people I spoke with in December say, for the ways this alone will create license for Jeffries detractors to develop false claims about what the era of his leadership may bring, including attempts to recast Jeffries as a threat, an outsider, an other with secret aims. It\u2019s worth noting that, like Obama, Jeffries is a Christian and Black American with an Arabic name. \u201cHe could be racialized and demonized by some on the far right to stoke their base,\u201d Overton says, \u201cespecially if Leader Jeffries becomes Speaker Jeffries in a couple of years.\u201d Read more:   Jeffries may well accomplish much despite the headwinds. But in this scenario, a deeper level of deliberation becomes necessary to get things done. Obama had a political path Belcher describes as \u201crazor thin\u201d that he could walk, and had to be \u201cabove reproach\u201d in order to prevent the forces pushing at him from closing in. There were times where that razor-thin path meant certain topics could not be discussed. Consider the reaction to Obama\u2019s description of the wrongful arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., who is Black, outside the professor\u2019s own home. Obama\u2019s early comments described the police officer\u2019s actions as both unwise and connected to an experience many Black people have had: excessively harsh treatment by police. The reaction was so negative that Obama essentially took it back\u2014though by the end of 2020, thousands more Americans had been killed by police, a disproportionate share of them were Black or Latino, and police accountability issues led to protests in many cities\u2019 streets. Jeffries will face something similar, Belcher predicts. He\u2019ll have to pick his moments and his language with care, and there will always be some who are inclined to insist that whatever he\u2019s said or done or put forward is inappropriate.    ",

        "title": "Exclusive: Fumio Kishida on Plans for a More Assertive Japan",
        "content": "The official residence of Japan\u2019s Prime Minister is a spooky place. Inspired by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, the stone and brick mansion in central Tokyo had been around for only three years when young naval officers charged in and assassinated Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai in 1932. Four years later, Prime Minister Keisuke Okada was forced to hide in a closet during another attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, which killed five and left bullet holes that still pepper the building\u2019s Art Deco facade.      Read More: It\u2019s to Hiroshima that Kishida welcomes leaders of the G7 from May 19 to 21, when he\u2019ll hope to leverage the city\u2019s tragic history to convince the world\u2019s most powerful democracies that only collective resolve can face down the authoritarian threat of an increasingly belligerent Russia, China, and North Korea. Tokyo may be 5,000 miles from Kyiv, but has alerted Japan to a more perilous world, not least since Japan remains entangled in land and sea territorial disputes with Russia, and regularly sees flying overhead. Even more worrisome for Japan has been China\u2019s aggression against Taiwan, the self-ruling island that authoritarian President Xi Jinping has repeatedly vowed to bring to heel. When Beijing launched military drills last summer to protest U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei, five missiles fell into the waters of Japan\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone, through which Chinese naval vessels and aircraft regularly intrude. Against this backdrop, Kishida in December since World War II, mirroring upticks in defense spending across Europe, including Germany, which like Japan was humbled by that war. The commitment would raise defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2027, giving Japan the world\u2019s third largest defense budget. And while previous Japanese leaders dithered over imposing international sanctions, Kishida has joined U.S.-led measures with alacrity. Read More:   Kishida\u2019s tenure has already encountered drama that belies his reputation as a bland functionary. On April 15, Kishida narrowly avoided joining the ghosts stalking the Prime Minister\u2019s residence when during a campaign speech, injuring a policeman. \u201cI am living in the world of politics,\u201d he shrugs when asked about the incident. \u201cAll sorts of events and developments could happen.\u201d When he took office 18 months ago, he was thought of as a steady but uninspiring politician, unscarred by scandal but lacking major accomplishments. His father and grandfather were both lawmakers, and he spent part of his childhood in the U.S., attending a public school in Queens. Classes were filled with children of myriad cultural and linguistic backgrounds, and Kishida says he found communication \u201cvery challenging.\u201d But because of this, \u201cI was reminded of the importance of listening carefully to the views of others,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a child, I was inspired by what makes America the United States, which is respect for freedom and an abundance of energy.\u201d   But it has not all been smooth on the domestic front. Kishida\u2019s following a backlash to his decision to hold a state funeral for Abe, over both the expense and Abe\u2019s polarizing character. Late last year, Kishida over a variety of scandals. In February, he dismissed a close aide for saying \u201cquite a few people would abandon this country\u201d if same-sex marriage were legalized, despite of the population\u2019s supporting it. In response, Kishida tells TIME that he is committed to \u201crealizing a society where diversity is respected.\u201d Kishida\u2019s approval rating has since picked up, and his LDP won key seats in local elections in April. Read More:   Kishida\u2019s domestic agenda rests on a nebulous \u201cincome-doubling plan\u201d to boost household earnings, but his big problem is how to pay for redistribution without alienating the affluent. Japan\u2019s ratio of public debt to GDP \u2014about double that of the U.S.\u2014and Kishida has little wiggle room to keep borrowing. When he floated the idea of raising taxes on stock transfers and dividends, . \u201cMr. Kishida has to be pretty careful to keep key right-wing support,\u201d says Mieko Nakabayashi, a professor at Tokyo\u2019s Waseda University and a former Japanese lawmaker.  Read More: Ultimately, Japan remains than the U.S. Kishida has charged Japan\u2019s Digital Agency to cut red tape and boost efficiency. Digital Minister Taro Kono tells TIME that he\u2019s discovered 9,000 government regulations that still require handling via antiquated technology, such as faxes, floppy disks, and the hanko\u2014an iconic carved stamp that is obligatory for many official documents.  It\u2019s a different kind of existential threat that will occupy the G7 in Hiroshima, where posters promoting the summit adorn billboards and vending machines across the city, with countdown clocks inside the cavernous main railway station. Denied a seat on the U.N. Security Council, Japan has always placed great emphasis on the economic grouping, where it is the only Asian member. Close aides to Kishida say that welcoming the G7 to his home city will be the realization of \u201ca lifelong dream.\u201d Not only is it Kishida\u2019s best chance to catapult Japan to true global leadership, Nakabayashi says he also may use any bounce in domestic approval as a platform to dissolve parliament and seek a fresh mandate.    Read More:    Read More:    Washington agrees. In recent months, President Biden has committed to enhanced military cooperation with Japan, , , and Australia. He will be pressuring Kishida to assist not only with defense matters but also to prevent technology transfer to China. Meanwhile, Beijing has set about courting the Global South with a new forum for international relations, which the nation\u2019s state media has dubbed \u201cXivilization.\u201d It\u2019s a clash of worldviews that promises to keep heating up. Kishida\u2019s mission at Hiroshima will be to keep focus on the city\u2019s charred remains and paper cranes. To let the ghosts have their say.",

        "content": "Bobby Tudor made a fortune in fracking. The clean-cut financier opened shop in 2007 and spent the next 10 years backing large-scale projects in West Texas, supercharging one of history\u2019s greatest oil and gas expansions. But over lunch in February, even as he predicted that oil and gas would be around for the foreseeable future, Tudor offered a dimmer view of the industry\u2019s role in the region. \u201cOil and gas is just not going to be the same engine for growth,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt will flatten, and then it will decline.\u201d    These divisions are setting up a surprising, high-stakes fight. Tudor\u2019s coalition, the Houston Energy Transition Initiative (HETI), is organized by the city\u2019s most prominent business group, and its members are putting serious cash behind new energy efforts. But some politicians are pushing back, launching efforts to slow renewable energy and publicly vilifying environment initiatives. \u201c[Major oil and gas firms] may have supported us in the past, but they certainly don\u2019t align with us now,\u201d says Jason Isaac of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go and chase money\u2014and it\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d Read More:         Read More:    \u201cHouston was the right place because the world of made things is made here,\u201d says Troy Thacker, the firm\u2019s CEO. Across the street, I visited Greentown Labs, an incubator where dozens of startups are working on everything from installing wind turbines more efficiently to turning cow manure into an alternative fuel source. Houston startups alone received $1.95 billion in venture-capital money in 2022, with energy-related startups raising almost as much as the next three sectors combined, according to data from the Greater Houston Partnership.  In Austin, I watched Jane Stricker, the executive director of HETI, present a vision of Texas as a capital of the energy transition to a gathering of lobbyists, regulators, and legislators. Her pitch: policy-makers should join with business leaders to speed the shift. \u201cWe can solidify our position if we really lean into our role,\u201d said Stricker, a former BP executive. \u201cWe have the opportunity to create massive economic growth.\u201d  Read More:    And then there\u2019s the anti-ESG rhetoric, a new front in the culture wars. Texas has banned a group of financial firms from doing business with state and local governments for using environmental, social, and governance metrics. These moves send a signal that green businesses aren\u2019t welcome. \u201cIt could go faster if the state political forces were less antagonistic,\u201d says Kay McCall, president of the Renewable Energy Alliance Houston. \u201cWhen you look at it, it\u2019s almost silly.\u201d  ",

        "content": "As doctors and public health officials keep trying to persuade parents to get their kids vaccinated against childhood diseases, the entreaties don\u2019t always do much. Currently, only 69.7% of two-year-olds in the U.S. have received their full vaccine series, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014including shots against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, and more. Just 10.1% of kids ages six months to four years have vaccine coverage against COVID-19. Part of the problem is the vocal anti-vaccine movement in the U.S. and a lack of access to adequate health care services. But another issue might be that the most effective pro-vaccine communicators aren\u2019t being used. According to a new study in the journal Pediatrics\u2014which focused on COVID-19 vaccines in particular, but has implications for all vaccination campaigns\u2014if you want to persuade parents to get their children vaccinated, the most convincing arguments may come not from health-care professionals, but from other trusted parents.

        "content": "It\u2019s no surprise that federal prosecutors have filed criminal charges against Rep. George Santos, as CNN first reported Tuesday night. It\u2019s only a surprise that it took this long. Ever since the New York Republican hit the national scene last year by winning a congressional seat on Long Island, the lies he told about his life have been unraveling. His resume was quickly blown to bits, starting with a New York Times investigation that unearthed criminal charges for check fraud in Brazil, a phony Baruch diploma (he didn\u2019t attend), a fake job on Wall Street, and a bogus pet nonprofit. That was just for starters. Soon the world knew all sorts of other things Santos had made up or embellished: a Jewish background, a volleyball championship, the 9/11-related death of his mother, a producer role in the catatonic Broadway production of Spider-Man. A stream of acquaintances emerged to detail a staggering array of grifts: how he ran off with money meant to save a disabled Navy veteran\u2019s pit bull; how he nabbed checks and a Burberry scarf; how he siphoned campaign money to pay for what looks like a roof over his head and meal after meal at the red-sauce joint Il Bacco, to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he claims to have mysteriously loaned to his campaign. Santos\u2019s lifetime of hustling rivals the fake heiress Anna Delvey, with the international swagger of Frank Abagnale in Catch Me If You Can. Read More: All the Investigations Into George Santos. I started reporting on Santos in 2019, when I called him for a routine introductory item for Newsday, Long Island\u2019s paper of record. He was supposedly launching his first run for Congress, but said he was at a work conference in Miami, some 1,300 miles from the district he wanted to represent. That was the first hint of weirdness. In the years that followed, I wrote about his lack of a fixed address, his vagueness on biographical details, his campaign finance irregularities, and his (unverified) suggestion that he was paying legal bills for Jan. 6 rioters. For the past few months, I\u2019ve delved deeper into his activities and background for my forthcoming book, \u201cThe Fabulist: The Lying, Hustling, Grifting, Stealing, and Very American Legend of George Santos.\u201d Sorting fact from fiction for Santos was an adventure that took me as far as Brazil. After journalist Marisa Kabas found a picture there of Santos, dressed in drag at the dawn of the Obama era, the congressman told reporters that he was not a drag queen, but simply a young man who \u201chad fun at a festival.\u201d That was not the recollection of multiple people I spoke to in and around Niteroi, the city next to Rio where Santos lived on and off as he came of age. There was the family friend who said Santos was known as a drag queen. There was the drag mentor Eula Rochard, who showed Santos how to brush wigs and choose earrings, and who remembers Santos saying he wanted to marry rich someday. There was the young girl who once considered Santos an uncle figure, and who can\u2019t forget him dancing with her, wearing a bra and a towel on his head, to the tune of Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cBad Romance.\u201d \u201cAnthony is moved by money,\u201d that girl\u2019s mother, Adriana Parizzi, told me in April. (She knew Santos as Anthony Devolder, a portion of his full name he used before his life in politics.) As we spoke, Parizzi passed her phone across a table to show me texts in Portuguese in which she blamed Santos for absconding with her jewelry, while Santos called her a whale and worse. The public allegations against Santos are just the tip of the iceberg. I\u2019ve found three people on two continents to whom he raised the prospect of immigration-related marriages\u2014to himself or others. Family members say he has run off with money from close relatives, even mooching off his grandmother. \u201cHe was trying to get any type of money for free as fast as possible,\u201d one of his ex-roommates told me, recalling his time living with Santos in New York in the 2010s. The embattled congressman is a strange character to interact with, as if all his shape shifting has deformed his sense of how a person should or needs to move in the world. He can be charming, and he knows how to flash the impression of having money, whether it\u2019s the Cartier watch he claims is a family heirloom or the way he\u2019d ostentatiously pay for another bottle of wine at dinner. One brief past boyfriend, who was a dishwasher at a Florida surf-and-turf restaurant when he met Santos on Grindr, told me that this new friend seemed charming and high class: \u201cI was mostly McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bell. He was mostly caviar and fancy food.\u201d Santos seems to lie without being able to help himself\u2014whether it\u2019s telling fellow call-center workers in a dusty College Point cubicle farm that his family has property in Nantucket, or his bizarre public claim that former Democratic congressman Steve Israel, the one-time leader of the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, was going to vote for Santos, the first Republican that Israel would have backed in his life. Read More: Why a Drag Queen Past Won\u2019t Loosen the GOP Grip of George Santos. The charges against Santos remain under seal. It\u2019s not known what crimes he is alleged to have committed. The congressman did not return a request for comment Tuesday night, but he has hardly been hiding in recent days. Just last week he ranted to me on the phone about my attempts to report on his background and talk to people who knew him, calling back to say more, and finally, texting threats. (\u201cI will move forward with legal ramifications if you do not stop,\u201d etc.). He has filed to run for re-election, putting House Republican leaders in a bind\u2014forced to back an alleged serial grifter, or throw one of their own overboard, reducing their already slim majority. I\u2019ve been told that Santos\u2019s mother\u2014whose funeral-home costs were never paid despite the family\u2019s church raising money for that purpose, and giving that money to Santos\u2014was known to sigh with exasperation when confronted with one of her son\u2019s bigger lies: \u201cOh, Anthony and his stories.\u201d Those stories may now be coming back to haunt Santos in a court of law. But his own tale is just beginning. Mark Chiusano has written for outlets such as Newsday, The Atlantic, and The Paris Review, and is the author of \u201cThe Fabulist.\u201d",

There was the drag mentor Eula Rochard, who showed Santos how to brush wigs and choose earrings, and who remembers Santos saying he wanted to marry rich someday. There was the young girl who once considered Santos an uncle figure, and who can\u2019t forget him dancing with her, wearing a bra and a towel on his head, to the tune of Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cBad Romance.\u201d \u201cAnthony is moved by money,\u201d that girl\u2019s mother, Adriana Parizzi, told me in April. (She knew Santos as Anthony Devolder, a portion of his full name he used before his life in politics.) As we spoke, Parizzi passed her phone across a table to show me texts in Portuguese in which she blamed Santos for absconding with her jewelry, while Santos called her a whale and worse. The public allegations against Santos are just the tip of the iceberg. I\u2019ve found three people on two continents to whom he raised the prospect of immigration-related marriages\u2014to himself or others. Family members say he has run off with money from close relatives, even mooching off his grandmother. \u201cHe was trying to get any type of money for free as fast as possible,\u201d one of his ex-roommates told me, recalling his time living with Santos in New York in the 2010s. The embattled congressman is a strange character to interact with, as if all his shape shifting has deformed his sense of how a person should or needs to move in the world. He can be charming, and he knows how to flash the impression of having money, whether it\u2019s the Cartier watch he claims is a family heirloom or the way he\u2019d ostentatiously pay for another bottle of wine at dinner. One brief past boyfriend, who was a dishwasher at a Florida surf-and-turf restaurant when he met Santos on Grindr, told me that this new friend seemed charming and high class: \u201cI was mostly McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bell. He was mostly caviar and fancy food.\u201d Santos seems to lie without being able to help himself\u2014whether it\u2019s telling fellow call-center workers in a dusty College Point cubicle farm that his family has property in Nantucket, or his bizarre public claim that former Democratic congressman Steve Israel, the one-time leader of the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, was going to vote for Santos, the first Republican that Israel would have backed in his life. Read More: Why a Drag Queen Past Won\u2019t Loosen the GOP Grip of George Santos. The charges against Santos remain under seal. It\u2019s not known what crimes he is alleged to have committed. The congressman did not return a request for comment Tuesday night, but he has hardly been hiding in recent days. Just last week he ranted to me on the phone about my attempts to report on his background and talk to people who knew him, calling back to say more, and finally, texting threats. (\u201cI will move forward with legal ramifications if you do not stop,\u201d etc.). He has filed to run for re-election, putting House Republican leaders in a bind\u2014forced to back an alleged serial grifter, or throw one of their own overboard, reducing their already slim majority. I\u2019ve been told that Santos\u2019s mother\u2014whose funeral-home costs were never paid despite the family\u2019s church raising money for that purpose, and giving that money to Santos\u2014was known to sigh with exasperation when confronted with one of her son\u2019s bigger lies: \u201cOh, Anthony and his stories.\u201d Those stories may now be coming back to haunt Santos in a court of law. But his own tale is just beginning. Mark Chiusano has written for outlets such as Newsday, The Atlantic, and The Paris Review, and is the author of \u201cThe Fabulist.\u201d",

        "title": "RNC Floats New Criteria for First Presidential Primary Debate",
        "content": "The RNC is planning its first set of presidential debates since the 2016 cycle, when Donald Trump dominated a crowded GOP field on his path to victory. Recently, the committee has floated a plan to multiple campaigns for the first debate, scheduled for August, of only allowing candidates that are polling at 1% or higher and have had at least 40,000 donors, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. Former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who is now president of the Young America\u2019s Foundation, one of the organizations partnering with the RNC to host that debate, tells TIME those numbers are in line with what he has heard, though he has not formally been told the debate criteria and does not know exactly when it will be set. \u201cFrom the early discussions I\u2019ve heard about, without a final decision being made, there\u2019ll probably be some sort of criteria for the number of individual donors, because that\u2019s a good way to show that people have legitimacy,\u201d Walker says. \u201cAt the same time, though, I don\u2019t know that they\u2019ll be quite as strict as they once were in the polls.\u201d The RNC did not respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment on the record before publication. If the committee sticks with the proposed criteria for the first debate in August, it will mark a change from the first debate of the 2016 cycle. The first GOP debate in August 2015 was split in two, with a prime-time debate for the ten candidates who averaged the highest national polling numbers, and an earlier undercard debate for candidates that didn\u2019t make the top ten. The candidates with the lowest polling that secured a spot in prime-time were polling around 3%, according to a  In 2020, when Democrats had the crowded field of presidential contenders, the Democratic National Committee only permitted candidates on stage for the first debate who were either polling at 1% or higher in an average of 3 national or early state polls, or had at least 65,000 different donors, with at least 200 donors in 20 different states. The discussions between the RNC and campaigns about the first debate come as the GOP field is poised to grow. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is widely expected to jump in the race soon, and others, including former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, have strongly signaled they may as well. If the debate were held now, the candidates who would clear the 1% threshold would include Trump, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, and entrepreneur and author Vivek Ramaswamy, according to  Walker says setting the polling threshold too high this early in the race could potentially knock out qualified candidates who would otherwise have a shot at the nomination. A donor threshold would ensure serious campaigns qualify, he adds. \u201cForty, fifty thousand individual donors\u2014numbers like that are very realistic to say, \u2018Okay, this is a legitimate candidate.\u2019\u201d While some candidates may struggle to clear the 1% threshold, Trump is blowing the rest of the field out of the water. The RCP average finds that he has the support of a majority of Republican primary voters. According to the  \u201cI see that everybody is talking about the Republican Debates, but nobody got my approval, or the approval of the Trump Campaign, before announcing them,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social last month. \u201cWhen you\u2019re leading by seemingly insurmountable numbers, and you have hostile Networks with angry, TRUMP & MAGA hating anchors asking the \u2018questions,\u2019 why subject yourself to being libeled and abused?\u201d Walker thinks that it would be a mistake for Trump to skip the first debate, which the former governor anticipates will have one of the largest audiences of any debate until mid-2024. He tells TIME that not attending would mean Trump missing an opportunity to appeal to curious general election voters, especially in a swing state as important as Wisconsin. \u201cHe is a prizefighter, and prizefighters belong in the ring defending their title,\u201d says Walker, who shared the presidential debate stage with him in 2015. And if Trump doesn\u2019t show? \u201cI think people will still tune in, but I think the audience clearly is going to be much larger if President Trump is there,\u201d Walker says. \u201cNot only does it hurt the debate and the candidates, but I think it hurts him.\u201d For other candidates who qualify, the first debate will be a critical opportunity to gain name recognition and draw a contrast with the former president. But without Trump in the room, that could be a lot tougher. \u201cHe certainly knows that the media attention to this event will be X if he\u2019s in the room and one-tenth of X if he\u2019s not,\u201d says Rick Wilson, the anti-Trump political strategist who co-founded the Lincoln Project. \u201cHe\u2019s going to try to leverage his presence or lack of presence to make the debates inconsequential or to make it into a coronation. \u2026 I think what you\u2019re going to see is the kids\u2019 table. They are going to all go out there and desperately try to not say the T-word in the debate.\u201d  Asked who might have a chance to beat the frontrunner, Wilson pauses. \u201cGod?\u201d he offers. \u201cI mean, maybe. And I\u2019m not even giving him very good odds.\u201d",

        "title": "ACLU Readies Lawsuit Over Biden's New Border Control Measures",
        "content": "Tens of thousands of people are expected to try to cross the border in the next few weeks after the pandemic-era practice of turning most people away at the border without hearing asylum claims ends at 11:59 pm on May 11. Smugglers, Biden administration officials say, have been telling migrants for months they will have a better chance of being admitted into the US when those Title 42 public health authorities expire with the formal end of the COVID-19 public health emergency. To deter people from crossing, US immigration officials have designed  \u201cWe plan to sue,\u201d Katrina Eiland, an ACLU attorney based in San Francisco, tells TIME. For the past several weeks, the organization has been analyzing the Biden Administration\u2019s asylum policies and drafting legal documents in preparation for the federal response to the end of Title 42, Eiland says. Those new asylum procedures were published in the federal register on Wednesday. The 447-page rule tells people they are likely to be rejected if they seek asylum after having passed through another country without requesting protection. Asylum candidates are also likely to be rejected if they did not use a new U.S. Customs and Border Protection smartphone app, called CBP One, to make an appointment to request asylum at a U.S. port of entry. Officials with several immigrant rights organizations believe the new rules are overly broad and will lead to thousands of people who would otherwise qualify for protection in the U.S. to be denied asylum without an asylum officer hearing their case. The ACLU believes the new rule violates a section of federal law that describes how the U.S. evaluates asylum cases, Eiland says, and doesn\u2019t do enough to separate asylum seekers who have strong claims for protection from those who don\u2019t. \u201cWe think it\u2019s illegal under the asylum laws and is arbitrary and capricious for a number of reasons and that it will do grave harm and expose vulnerable asylum seekers to danger,\u201d Eiland says. That law requires an applicant to establish for an asylum officer that they have been persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An individual may seek asylum after arriving in the United States \u201cwhether or not at a designated port of arrival,\u201d the law states. During the Trump administration, the ACLU and other organizations sued and blocked two efforts to restrict access to asylum. In those cases, a U.S. district court judge in Northern California agreed the Trump-era changes were too onerous and the Ninth Circuit upheld those rulings. \u201cThe Trump asylum bans penalized people who didn\u2019t apply for asylum in countries they transited through before arriving in the U.S. and for entering the country without inspection,\u201d says Eiland. \u201cThis puts both of those requirements together in one rule.\u201d Kate Melloy Goettel, legal director of litigation at the American Immigration Council, says the new standard creates \u201ca huge obstacle for asylum seekers\u201d and \u201cturns asylum law on its head.\u201d The CBP One smartphone app, where migrants are urged to register for a time to appear at a point of entry to have their case evaluated, is glitchy, isn\u2019t available in enough languages, and \u201cis not ready for prime-time,\u201d Goettel says. The new law creates what is called a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d of denial if a person crosses the border between ports of entry or didn\u2019t try to claim asylum in a country they transited through. \u201cThat is not what our asylum law says. People can seek asylum at a port or entry or between ports of entry under our domestic law,\u201d Goettel says. Asked on Wednesday what Biden\u2019s back up plan is if the asylum rule gets blocked in court, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force One, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the legalities here. That\u2019s not something that I do. Certainly, if it gets there, that\u2019s something the Department of Justice will deal with.\u201d Biden spoke with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador on the phone Tuesday about the changes to U.S. immigration procedures at the border. Mexico has agreed to take migrants back into Mexico if they\u2019ve been turned away. Biden recently deployed more troops to support Border Patrol and is setting up centers in Colombia and Guatemala where migrants can check if they qualify for entry to the U.S. before traveling to the border. Asked on Tuesday if the US is ready for a surge of people coming to the border in the coming weeks, Biden said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be chaotic for a while.\u201d",

        "title": "Scientists Are Using Sound To Unlock Our Planet\u2019s Secrets",
        "content": "From a root system up to 90 feet underground, to balloons floating 70,000 feet above earth, a series of recent audible insights are being showcased this week by experts gathering at the annual Acoustical Society of America conference. The new data revealed by these sounds are helping scientists better understand the natural world. For example, last year researchers  It\u2019s a \u201cchance to really listen in on a new world,\u201d says Daniel Bowman, a senior scientist at Sandia National Laboratories, a Department of Energy national security and technology lab, adding that this type of research provides \u201canother perspective on sound from a different vantage point\u201d\u2014in his case, miles above the ground. In a layer of our atmosphere far above where commercial planes soar, a group of scientists, including Bowman, have been releasing balloons to record otherwise un-heard sounds from the relatively calm region of our sky. Using low-frequency microbarometers they were able to detect what the earth sounds like from so high up\u2014from thunderstorms to wind turbines and freight trains. In a 19-day-long  Bowman hopes to use his findings to inspire others\u2014whether a middle school science student or professional researchers\u2014to conduct similar experiments to better study this little explored region of our sky. The balloons his project used are cheap, using $50-worth of materials, and easily constructed, and can be used not only for recording acoustics but for things such as aerial photography or measuring greenhouse gasses. (His experiment is also part of a proof-of-concept with NASA to explore seismic activity on Venus.) \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve explored every nook and cranny of the stratosphere,\u201d he says, \u201cso it still has prizes for us.\u201d There may also be lots new to discover underground. The world\u2019s largest tree by weight and landmass lives in southern Utah. Known as Pando, the 9,000-year-old aspen grove is a singular organism made up of more than 47,000 genetically identical trees. As a conference presentation detailed, the nonprofit Friends of Pando used hydrophones, underwater microphones, to  \u201cIt\u2019s similar to two cans connected by a string. Except there are 47,000 cans connected by a huge root system,\u201d Jeff Rice, a sound artist working with the nonprofit, said in a statement. Leaves rustling in the wind caused the hydrophone to pick up underground signals\u2014the more vigorously the leaves and branches shook, the stronger the signal. \u201cWhile it started as art, we see enormous potential for use in science,\u201d said Lance Oditt, the nonprofit\u2019s executive director. \u201cWind, converted to vibration (sound) and traveling the root system, could also reveal the inner workings of Pando\u2019s vast hidden hydraulic system in a nondestructive manner.\u201d The group hopes to use data from these recordings to study water movement, insect colonies, and root depth, among other things. That said, artistic interpretation of nature\u2019s sounds is, in itself, another valuable way of making sense of the world we live in. Also showcased this week at the conference, for example, was a percussion-based song  Sound is a powerful sense. Rainfall and lapping waves can calm us. Sirens send us warnings. And just a snippet of a song\u2019s chorus can bring back a lost memory. By unearthing previously inaccessible sounds scientists are now connecting us more intimately than ever to the world around us. And by turning data into music, artists can help us experience potentially abstract science in a visceral new way. Together, this can force us to think, and feel, differently about nature\u2019s wonders, and our impact on the planet.",

        "title": "France riots: Nanterre rocked by killing and unrest",
        "content": "Come to Nanterre to get an all-round view of the crisis boiling over in France. But if you are a journalist, be advised to keep your head down. An approach to a group of young men - some bearded, one built like a bodybuilder - outside the Le 35 caf\u00e9 prompts an aggressive outburst of swearing and a pointed finger directing me to keep out. At the scene where police shot dead a 17-year-old boy of Algerian descent last Tuesday, women in Islamic headscarves shout abuse at police and the media from passing cars. Wandering through the streets incognito - without a camera or notebook - past burned-out cars and smashed premises it is possible to pick up glimpses of the last catastrophic few days. Three middle-aged white ladies, Lucille, Marie and Jeanne, are chatting with a black male friend on a bench outside their block of flats. The area is pristine, surrounded by gardens - like many other apartment blocks in Nanterre. They don't want to be photographed as they fear their children would be identified and targeted as a result, but they are happy to chat. \"The last three nights have been appalling. Between midnight and 4am it is bedlam outside our windows. No-one can sleep. I feel like I'm living on another planet,\" says Lucille. Do they perhaps not feel the anger from the rioters is understandable, when one of Nanterre's young residents, Nahel, has been shot dead at a police check? \"This rioting has nothing to do with what happened. Of course, the kid shouldn't have been killed. But what was he doing joyriding without a licence at eight o'clock in the morning, when children are going to school?\" Marie looks at a smashed bus-shelter daubed with graffiti that reads \"one cop, one bullet\". \"You see what it says there? That I am completely against. I don't think the police are racist. There are good and bad in every group of people,\" she says. They have little time for the dead teenager's mother, Mounia, who took part in a mass march in memory of Nahel on Thursday. \"What was she doing up on that open-top van in the march? It was undignified. That wasn't a march of grief. She's playing politics.\" The others nod in agreement. Not far away on the Avenue Georges Clemenceau, lined with plane trees, the pr\u00e9fet who heads the Hauts-de-Seine department has come to survey the wreckage that was the front of the local tax office. \"Deplorable, lamentable,\" he says. Firework rockets fired by rioters at the building have left gaping holes in upper-floor windows. At street level, every pane has been smashed with a heavy instrument. Charred tax forms are scattered outside the entrance. Among the onlookers is tax inspector Cyril, who lives in Nanterre but also declines to be photographed. \"What I feel is just wretched sadness,\" he says. \"This tax office serves the people of Nanterre. The money that comes from here is used to buy them services. What on earth is the point of attacking it? It's a totally disproportionate response.\" Cyril, however, says he is broadly sympathetic with people who want to protest against Tuesday's killing. \"I'm not sure if racist police is correct. Let's just say they have an attitude. The kids around here have all had rough treatment, often because they were doing something stupid, sure. \"But look, this was a kid,\" says Cyril. \"The officer was an adult. He had a gun. It was his job to be in control of the situation. And he wasn't.\" There are far stronger views, of course, among locals who took part in the memorial march. Like Bakari, who doesn't justify the riots but believes they are understandable: \"Certain people react against violence with violence.\" \"I wasn't surprised by [Nahel's killing] because we have all had bad experiences with police. There are good and bad everywhere, but the large majority of police are racist.\" Or Yasmina: \"I absolutely hate the French police. I wish them the worst. The whole system is corrupted by a systemic, racist ideology. \"[Nahel] could have been my kid brother. It blows my mind to think that a kid like that can make some stupid mistake, like anyone could do. He didn't deserve to die.\" The town of Nanterre is far from the hellhole of isolated social deprivation some would like to depict. It is spacious, clean and two stops on the commuter train from the Arc de Triomphe in the centre of Paris. The towers of La D\u00e9fense business district are a stone's throw away. There is a theatre, a university, the national opera dance school, and a large park named after former President Charles de Gaulle's culture minister Andr\u00e9 Malraux. Unfortunately, yesterday the children's roundabout that has stood there for the last 50 years was burned down. The over-riding impression one takes away of the town is of two universes colliding. On one level, all the standard accoutrements of the generous French state are plain to see. Tricolours fly; the pr\u00e9fet comes to survey his domain; Metro trains whizz underground and, in the looming towers of La D\u00e9fense multinationals make their billions. But in the same geographic space, there is another way of being: one which appears utterly alienated from the system; which is quick to see and reflect hostility; which says \"ici on est chez nous\" - this patch is ours - and gives the finger to unwanted outsiders, like the press. At a petrol station by the tax office, veteran Paris-Match photographer Eric Hadj is surveying his smashed-up car and preparing forms for the insurance claim. \"We were here on Thursday during the march. Some big guys came and told us to get out. They made it quite clear we risked something very nasty if we didn't. When we came back today, of course the car had been totally wrecked.\" Hadj has been through a lot of riots in his time but says he has never seen anything like this. \"This is worse, far worse than 2005,\" he says. Everyone here is looking back to the last sustained rioting that shook the French banlieues or suburbs for three weeks, wondering how long the latest unrest will last. \"Today there is social media, which gives the rioters a big advantage. But, above all, it is more violent. They have rockets. Whatever restraint there was has been removed,\" says the photographer. G\u00e9rard Collomb, the former socialist mayor of Lyon and interior minister under President Macron, is well-known for his pithy sayings. When he left office in 2018, he lamented the worrying tendency of French society to divide into communities - the very contradiction, he thought, of a single, unified Republic. \"Today we are living side by side,\" he said. \"Tomorrow, I fear we will be face to face.\" In Nanterre it is one face of France against another.",

        "title": "Ukraine war corrosive for Vladimir Putin - CIA boss",
        "content": "The Ukraine war is having a \"corrosive\" effect on Vladimir Putin's leadership of Russia, according to the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Russian disaffection over the war is providing new opportunities for the CIA to collect intelligence, the agency's Director William J Burns said. America's top spy made the comments while delivering the annual lecture at the Ditchley Foundation in the UK. He was speaking a week after the mutiny by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin. Mr Burns said everyone had been \"riveted\" by the scenes last Saturday of Prigozhin's \"armed challenge\" to Moscow, when his Wagner mercenary forces marched towards Russia's capital. Prigozhin's actions were \"a vivid reminder of the corrosive effect of Putin's war on his own society and his own regime\", he said. The CIA director said the impact not just of Prigozhin's actions but also his statements - which included an indictment of both the rationale and execution of Russia's invasion - would play out for some time. \"Disaffection with the war will continue to gnaw away at the Russian leadership,\" Mr Burns said in his prepared remarks. \"That disaffection creates a once in a generation opportunity for us at CIA,\" referring to the role of the agency in recruiting human agents to provide intelligence. \"We are not letting it go to waste,\" he said to laughter from the audience. \"We are very much open for business.\" The CIA has recently launched a new social media campaign to try and reach people in Russia, including a video posted to the Telegram social media site, which is widely used by Russians. The campaign provided instructions on how to contact the CIA on the dark web without being monitored. This video gained 2.5 million views in the first week. Director Burns also reiterated the message other US officials have previously made in public that the US had no part in Prigozhin's mutiny. He did not directly address recent reports in the Washington Post that he made a secret visit to the Ukrainian capital before the mutiny. It was reported that discussions included the possibility that progress in Ukraine's counter-offensive might open the way for negotiations from a position of greater strength if substantial territory was taken. Mr Burns - who previously served as the US Ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008 - said spending much of the last two decades trying to understand Russian President Putin had given him a \"healthy dose of humility about pontificating about Putin and Russia\". But he added that one thing that he had learnt was that it was always a mistake to underestimate Mr Putin's fixation on controlling Ukraine. The Russian leader believed that without Ukraine, Russia could not be a major power and Mr Putin himself could not be a great leader, he said. \"That tragic and brutish fixation has already brought shame to Russia and exposed its weaknesses,\" Mr Burns said. \"Putin's war has already been a strategic failure for Russia: its military weaknesses laid bare, its economy badly damaged for years to come, its future as a junior partner and economic colony of China being shaped by Putin's mistakes.\" Turning to China, the CIA boss said it would be foolish for the US to attempt to decouple because of the deep economic interdependence between the two countries. \"China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and increasingly the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do so,\" he said. The US should instead \"sensibly de-risk and diversify by securing resilient supply chains, protecting our technological edge and investing in industrial capacity\", he added.",

        "title": "The man who helped Orban and Netanyahu rise to power",
        "content": "\"It's good to have an enemy,\" says George Birnbaum, one of the godfathers of modern populism. \"Very rarely will you find someone who's loved by everybody.\" A political consultant for 30 years, he helped Benjamin Netanyahu come to power in a surprise victory in Israel in 1996, and Hungary's Viktor Orban in 2010. He has clients in many countries, and flits nowadays between New York, Dubai and Harare. George Birnbaum built his reputation as one of \"Arthur's kids\" - under mentor and late business partner Arthur Finkelstein, a brilliant mathematician who re-invented the art of political campaigning in the US, helping Richard Nixon to power in 1972, as well as many other Republican leaders. \"One should\u2026try to polarise the election around that issue that cuts best in your direction, i.e. drugs, crime, race in New York State\u2026,\" Finkelstein wrote in a 1970 memo. \"When the opponent seizes the polarisation initiative, then you're in trouble.\" The duo scored a dramatic upset with Benjamin Netanyahu's first election victory in Israel, which came just months after the assassination of incumbent PM Shimon Peres's predecessor Yitzhak Rabin. Voters were electrified by slogans such as \"Peres will divide Jerusalem\" - in peace talks with the Palestinians. Was it true, I ask. \"'Whether or not it would have been a line down the middle of Jerusalem, I don't think that's true,\" he admits today. \"But there were certain areas of the municipality\u2026that were discussed as being given to the Palestinian Authority as part of a peace deal.\" In 2008, they began work for Hungary's Viktor Orban, whose right-wing Fidesz party won a landslide victory in 2010. Three years later, with more elections on the horizon, the decision was taken: Viktor Orban needed a new enemy - a man Hungarians could be told to fear. After copious opinion surveys, the duo struck on George Soros, the then 85-year-old Hungarian-born US billionaire and philanthropist, as a perfect target. Viktor Orban has vilified him ever since. \"George Soros was a good target,\" George Birnbaum tells me, \"Because enough people in Hungary didn't like the idea of this billionaire behind the curtain, almost like\u2026 the Wizard of Oz, controlling politics and policy.\" But did he really? In 2015, the year George Birnbaum stopped working for Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister discovered a new enemy: Muslim migrants. And when in September that year George Soros suggested the EU should absorb large numbers of asylum seekers, the Hungarian leader was quick to signal \"a Soros plan\". However implausible, the Jewish philanthropist was accused of a plot to destroy Christian Europe with Muslim immigrants - an idea already gaining ground on the far-right fringes of European politics as \"the Great Replacement theory\". Migrants became the feared \"other\" in the world-view of many Hungarians, replacing Jews or Gypsies. And the demonisation of George Soros radiated from Hungary, around the globe. \"Don't be afraid to call your enemies by their name. They will never show mercy. Consider for a moment George Soros,\" Viktor Orban told Republicans at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in the US state of Texas in 2022. \"I know George Soros very well. He is my opponent. He believes in none of the things that we do,\" the Hungarian leader told his American hosts. George Birnbaum's wife is Ukrainian, and the couple visit Ukraine often - as close friends of Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko. I point out that Russia's Vladimir Putin - who sent troops into Ukraine last year - has said that liberalism has become obsolete. The Russian leader loses no opportunity to rail against the decadence of the liberal West, multiculturalism, immigration, and human rights. Isn't that the West which Ukraine is trying to join? Which George Soros believes in? The war in Ukraine, George Birnbaum says, \"has reminded us why freedom matters, and why democracy matters\". If he met George Soros in the street he would invite him for a drink, he says. \"We disagree on a lot of things\u2026 But I would like to find out where are the places that we see the same future for Western democracy, for liberal democracy.\" \"I have a problem with the extremes on both sides, whether it's the progressive liberalism of the left or the extreme right-wing isolationist conservatism that exists on the right now.\" As for Viktor Orban, nearly a decade has passed, he says, since they last spoke. He admired him when they first met as \"a very intellectually smart individual, someone who had a deep knowledge of the economy, and other areas of policy\u2026 and that's rare\". Now he believes Viktor Orban has been in power too long. In January 2015, the Hungarian leader suggested that \"every migrant is a potential terrorist\". By July 2022, he had told supporters that \"we are willing to mix with one another, but we do not want to become peoples of mixed-race\". George Birnbaum disagrees strongly with both statements. His critics argue he foments polarisation in politics - but what is the antidote to this? \"The best kind of leaders are those who remind us of common goals, and not of our differences. It's not about ideology, it's about making sure that people's hopes and dreams are realised,\" he says.",

        "title": "Wagner: Russians reflect on group's advance towards Moscow",
        "content": "A week on from the dramatic mutiny by Wagner forces, residents in Rostov-on-Don - the city the mercenary troops seized - have been reflecting on the events that rocked Russia. In just 24 hours, leader of the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, staged an insurrection, sending troops into the city of a million people and further on towards Moscow. Due to the current laws against criticising the so-called \"special military operation\" in Russia, the BBC has chosen to protect the identities of the citizens who spoke to us. One Rostov-on-Don local - who the BBC is calling Vadim - described the moment he spotted Wagner forces in the city. \"I had to leave my home that day just to pop out and get something from the shop. About ten or eleven, I saw these armed people that had closed off the road. They were checking cars, asking people for documents but passers-by were simply allowed to carry on walking,\" he told the BBC World Service's Weekend programme. When Vadim got home, he started receiving calls from worried friends asking him if he was okay. He decided to stay at home for the rest of the day. \"If I am to speak of the feelings I experienced that day, I suppose you could say I was alarmed and perhaps even scared. We knew that Prigozhin had planned to do something and Wagner is known for its crimes in various countries. \"The association that we have of Wagner killing someone with a sledgehammer caused me to be afraid,\" he added. Vadim says the war in Ukraine has changed the city completely. Its become more militarised and has a number of military hospitals and wounded people. \"The city is really quite close to the front and that's how it feels.\" As Vadim sat at home in Rostov-on-Don, Anastasia was visiting Moscow from St Petersburg. \"We were checking the news together through the night and we woke up in the morning and there was even more news,\" she said. \"That was intense\". Anastasia, also a pseudonym, was staying with a friend in the southwest of the city, where preparations for the arrival of Wagner forces had started. She wasn't frightened that the troops would overtake the capital, she said. What made her anxious was the sheer uncertainty of the situation. \"All these things that seemed unreal previously, were beginning to happen. And it was completely unclear what was coming next. It was kind of scary, that uncertainty,\" she recalled. \"When Prigozhin started his march to Moscow, we didn't have any optimistic scenarios or what will happen. No one around me was happy about Prigozhin taking Moscow,\" Anastasia said. \"All scenarios seemed pretty bad. And the only thing that kind of felt hopeful was that something seemed to be changing. Some factors were making it possible to change. And then it ended.\" By the end of Saturday, Prigozhin called the advance off and ordered his men back to base. His troops had come within 124 miles (200km) of reaching Moscow. They retreated and by Monday, Wagner troops started leaving the city of Rostov-on-Don. Vadim said life in the city has returned to normal but everyone has been joking about the events of the past week. \"We've been saying that on Saturday there was a mutiny, Sunday there was a day off, Monday there was a fire in the zoo, Tuesday there was flooding because of heavy rain and on Wednesday there were some people fighting with knives.\" In regards to the political situation in Russia right now, Vadim says there hasn't been stability in the country since the invasion of Ukraine. \"You know there's a saying in Chekov that in the first scene, the gun is hung on the wall and in the final scene, it fires. And you reap what you sow. So none of this is very unexpected.\"",

        "title": "France shooting: Who was Nahel M, shot by French police in Nanterre?",
        "content": "The killing of Nahel M, 17, has sparked riots in cities across France as well as the town of Nanterre to the west of Paris where he grew up. An only child brought up by his mother, he had been working as a takeaway delivery driver and played rugby league. His education was described as chaotic. He was enrolled at a college in Suresnes not far from where he lived, to train to be an electrician. Those who knew Nahel, who was of Algerian descent, said he was well-loved in Nanterre where he lived with his mother Mounia and had apparently never known his father. His record of attendance of college was poor. Nahel had been in trouble before and was known to police, but family lawyers stressed he had no criminal record. He had given his mother a big kiss before she went to work, with the words \"I love you, Mum\". Shortly after nine in the morning on Tuesday he was fatally shot in the chest, point-blank, at the wheel of a Mercedes car for driving off during a police traffic check. At 17 he was too young for a licence. \"What am I going to do now?\" asked his mother. \"I devoted everything to him,\" she said. \"I've only got one, I haven't got 10 [children]. He was my life, my best friend.\" His grandmother spoke of him as a \"kind, good boy\". \"A refusal to stop doesn't give you a licence to kill,\" said Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure. \"All the children of the Republic have a right to justice.\" Nahel had spent the past three years playing for the Pirates of Nanterre rugby club. He had been part of an integration programme for teenagers struggling in school, run by an association called Ovale Citoyen. The programme was aimed at getting people from deprived areas into apprenticeships and Nahel was learning to be an electrician. Ovale Citoyen president Jeff Puech was one of the adults locally who knew him best. He had seen him only a few days ago and spoke of a \"kid who used rugby to get by\". \"He was someone who had the will to fit in socially and professionally, not some kid who dealt in drugs or got fun out of juvenile crime,\" Mr Puech told Le Parisien. He praised the teenager's \"exemplary attitude\", a far cry from what he condemned as a character assassination of him painted on social media. He had got to know Nahel when he lived with his mother in the Vieux-Pont suburb of Nanterre before they moved to the Pablo Picasso estate. Shortly after his death an ambulance man, Marouane, launched a tirade against a police officer, explaining later that he knew the boy as if he was his little brother. He had seen him grown up as a kind, helpful child. \"He never raised a hand to anyone and he was never violent,\" he told reporters. His mother believes the police officer who shot him \"saw an Arab face, a little kid, and wanted to take his life\". She told France 5 TV she blamed only the one person who fired the shot, not the police: \"I have friends who are officers - they're with me wholeheartedly.\" \"May Allah grant him mercy,\" read a banner unfurled over the Paris ring road outside Parc des Princes stadium. \"Police violence happens every day, especially if you're Arab or black,\" said one young man in another French city calling for justice for Nahel. But the family's lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, said this was not about racism, but about justice. \"We have a law and judicial system that protects police officers and it creates a culture of impunity in France,\" he told the BBC. Nahel had been the subject of as many as five police checks since 2021 - what is known as a refus d'obtemp\u00e9rer - refusing to comply with an order to stop. When he was stopped by police, he was driving a Mercedes with Polish number plates, with two passengers and no licence. As recently as last weekend, he had reportedly been placed in detention for refusing to comply and was due to appear before a juvenile court in September. His name was on a police file called a Taj, used by authorities for a variety of investigations. Last September a judge imposed a \"disciplinary measure\". Most of the trouble he got into involved cars: driving without a licence or insurance and using false number plates. But Nahel had never been convicted, said family lawyer Jennifer Cambla, and had no criminal record. Being known to police was not the same as a criminal record, because he had never been tried for anything listed on his police file, she told French TV. \"I think in this kind of suburb it's pretty rare that a young person hasn't been stopped by police or hasn't been in custody,\" Ms Cambla said. The riots that his death has provoked are a reminder for many in France of the events of 2005, when two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traor\u00e9, were electrocuted as they fled police after a game of football and ran into an electricity substation in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois. \"It could have been me, it could have been my little brother,\" a Clichy teenager called Mohammed told French website Mediapart.",

        "title": "France shooting: Calmer night despite protests over Nahel M's murder, minister says",
        "content": "France has seen a quieter night of protests over the death of a teenager shot by police at point-blank range, the interior minister says. There were fewer arrests compared to previous nights - 719 - with the worst clashes in the southern city Marseille. In the Paris suburb L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses, attackers rammed a car into the house of the mayor, injuring his wife as she tried to flee with their two children. French cities have seen unrest since the police shooting of a teenager. Nahel M, 17, was shot during a traffic stop on Tuesday. Large crowds turned out for his funeral on Saturday. In a tweet, Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin praised law enforcement for their \"resolute action\" which had led to a \"calmer night\". Around 45,000 police were deployed across the country for a second night on Saturday. More than 1,300 arrests were made on Friday night and more than 900 on Thursday. Officials hope that a turning-point may have been reached - that rioters are losing energy thanks to the security crackdown and the massive unpopularity of their exactions. However, until more nights of quiet confirm the trend, no-one is assuming anything. In Marseille, heavy clashes took place between police and rioters throughout Saturday evening. In footage circulating online, police can be seen using tear gas against people in the city. The video shows the clashes taking place on La Canebi\u00e8re, the main avenue in the heart of Marseille. French media report that fighting took place between a large group of rioters and officers. In Paris, large numbers of police were seen along the iconic Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es avenue. There had been calls on social media for protesters to gather there but the police presence seems to have kept most of them away. The capital's police said they made 194 arrests. The Paris region stopped all buses and trams after 21:00 for a second night running. L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun said his wife and one of his children had been injured when fleeing an attacker who had rammed his house with a car and then set the car on fire. He called it \"a murder attempt of unspeakable cowardice\". In the northern city of Lille, police special forces were seen on the streets. Images from the city overnight showed firefighters extinguishing blazes in cars that had been set alight by rioters. Twenty-one people were arrested in the city of Lyon. Clashes were also reported in Nice and Strasbourg. Nahel's funeral service was held at the mosque in Nanterre earlier on Saturday. Supporters of the family told the news media to keep away. All filming - even on phones - was banned: \"No Snapchat, no Insta,\" mourners were told. Nahel was shot after refusing to stop for a traffic check and died after emergency services attended the scene. A video, shared online in the hours following Nahel's death, showed two police officers trying to stop the vehicle and one pointing his weapon at the driver. The officer who fired the fatal shot has since been charged with voluntary homicide and apologised to the family. His lawyer said he was devastated. Nahel's death has reignited debate around the state of French policing, including a controversial 2017 firearms law which allows officers to shoot when a driver ignores an order to stop. More widely, it has led to questions of racism in the force. The UN's human rights office said the unrest was a chance for France \"to address deep issues of racism in law enforcement\". President Emmanuel Macron condemned the violence on Friday \"with the greatest firmness\" and said Nahel's death had been used to justify acts of violence - calling it an \"unacceptable exploitation of the adolescent's death\".",

        "title": "The false French riot posts spreading online",
        "content": "France has seen another night of unrest after the fatal shooting by police of a 17-year-old boy in a Paris suburb. Images of the unrest, which has spread to other French cities, are being shared on social media. As well as genuine video, false and misleading claims are also circulating, with the potential to increase tensions. BBC Verify has been investigating some of these. A striking image showing a group of young men driving a French police van, with one hanging out of the window brandishing a gun, has been shared on Twitter with the words \"France, photo of the day\". The tweet, posted early on 2 July had over 1.7m views but it's false - it's not from the current riots in France but is actually a still from a film. BBC Verify examined the image and, searching for previous versions of it on the internet, found it was from the French film, Athena - a fictional account of rioting in a city suburb - made in 2022. The people in the van and the blue motorcycle are exactly the same. The person who posted the tweet later clarified that the image was meant to be of an \"illustrative\" nature, but not before it had been retweeted thousands of times. He subsequently deleted it. Footage of cars falling from the windows of a multi-storey car park has been widely shared online, with the message: \"WTF is going on in France\u2026\". This is false - it is old footage and it looks like it has come from another film. BBC Verify took images of the video and carried out an online search to see if it had appeared before. The search brought up a tweet from June 2016, which claimed the footage was from the set of the action movie, Fast and Furious 8 - which was filmed in Cleveland, Ohio. Using the information in that tweet, BBC Verify located the footage to a multi-storey car park on Prospect Avenue East in Cleveland. The colours of the cars and the outside of the building match a scene from the film, which came out in 2017. Over the past few days, a video has been shared repeatedly on Twitter and the messaging app, Telegram showing a hooded man, on a rooftop pointing what appears to be a rifle. One Twitter user posted the video with the accompanying message: \"Rioter in France takes up sniper position with stolen police rifle.\" Another account claims the rifle was stolen from a police van. A Telegram user displayed the fire emoji next to the French flag and stated: \"looters covered by a sniper.\" The video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times across different platforms and accounts, and retweeted thousands of times. But the video was not filmed during the current disturbances, it is old footage. By searching for previous instances of the video on social media, BBC Verify can confirm it was posted on Twitter on 13 March, 2022. The man's clothing, position on the rooftop and visible buildings are identical in both tweets. It wasn't possible to confirm the exact location or whether the rifle was real or a replica gun. One Twitter user, aware of the earlier instances of this video, commented that the alleged sniper must have \"been there over a year now.\" BBC Verify is looking at other examples of false and misleading posts about the French riots.

        "title": "Sweden Quran burning: Iran won't send ambassador to Stockholm over incident",
        "content": "The Iranian government has refused to send a new ambassador to Sweden after a protester burned a Quran outside a mosque in the capital, Stockholm. An Iraqi-born refugee burnt the Muslim holy book outside a mosque on the first day of Eid al-Adha. Swedish police charged him with agitation against an ethnic or national group last week. Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, blamed the government for granting him the protest permit. Plans to burn copies of the Quran have sparked riots in Sweden in recent months. Police had rejected similar protest applications recently, but courts then ruled that they should be allowed on freedom of expression grounds. Muslims consider the Quran the sacred word of God and view any intentional damage or show of disrespect towards it as deeply offensive. Mr Amirabdollahian said despite appointing a new ambassador, Tehran would not be sending them. \"The process of dispatching them has been held off due to the Swedish government's issuing of a permit to desecrate the Holy Koran\", he said in a statement on Twitter. Iraq's foreign ministry also asked its Swedish counterpart to extradite the man who burned the Quran. They argued that since he still holds an Iraqi citizenship, he should face trial in Baghdad. After the incident, thousands of Iraqi protesters raided the Swedish embassy in Iraq at the instigation of the the populist Shia cleric, Moqtaha al-Sadr. They left after fifteen minutes when a security force was deployed. The prime minister of Sweden, Ulf Kristersson, denounced the raid on the embassy, but also said it was time for Sweden to reflect on its identity. \"It is of course completely unacceptable for people to unlawfully break into Swedish embassies in other countries. I think we also need to reflect in Sweden. It is a serious security situation, there is no reason to insult other people,\" he said. Following an emergency meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah on Sunday, the Saudi-based organisation called for member states to take \"unified and collective measures\" to stop countries burning copies of Islam's holy book. The secretary general, Hissein Brahim Taha said the burnings of the Quran were \"not mere ordinary Islamophobia incidents\" and urged countries worldwide to adhere to international law \"which clearly prohibits any advocacy of religious hatred\". Morocco, Kuwait, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates - among other countries - have recalled their ambassadors to Stockholm following the incident. It has also sparked anger in other Muslim-majority nations including Turkey - a Nato member which has a say over whether Sweden also gains membership. On Wednesday, the country's foreign minister tweeted that it was \"unacceptable to allow anti-Islam protests in the name of freedom of expression\".",

        "title": "Hachiko: The world's most loyal dog turns 100",
        "content": "The Chinese tagline on the movie poster says it all: \"I will wait for you, no matter how long it takes.\" It tells the true story of Hachiko, the faithful dog that continued to wait for its master at a train station in Japan long after his death. The cream white Akita Inu, born 100 years ago, has been memorialised in everything from books to movies to the cult science fiction sitcom Futurama. And the Chinese iteration - the third after a Japanese version in 1987, and the Richard Gere-starrer in 2009 - is a hit at the box office. There have been tales of other devoted hounds such as Greyfriars Bobby, but none with the global impact of Hachiko. A bronze statue of him has stood outside Shibuya Station in Tokyo, where he waited in vain for a decade, since 1948. The statue was first erected in 1934 before being recycled for the war effort during World War Two. Japanese schoolchildren are taught the story of Chuken Hachiko - or loyal dog Hachiko - as an example of devotion and fidelity. Hachiko represents the \"ideal Japanese citizen\" with his \"unquestioning devotion\", says Professor Christine Yano of the University of Hawaii - \"loyal, reliable, obedient to a master, understanding, without relying upon rationality, their place in the larger scheme of things\". Hachiko was born in November 1923 in the city of Odate in Akita prefecture, the original home of Akitas. A large-sized Japanese dog, the Akita is one of the country's oldest and most popular breeds. Designated by the Japanese government as a national icon in 1931, they were once trained to hunt animals like wild boar and elk. \"Akita dogs are calm, sincere, intelligent, and brave [and] obedient to their masters,\" said Eietsu Sakuraba, author of an English language children's book about Hachiko. \"On the other hand, it also has a stubborn personality and is wary of anyone other than its master.\" The year Hachiko was born, Hidesaburo Ueno, a renowned agricultural professor and a dog lover, asked a student to find him an Akita puppy. After a gruelling train journey, the puppy arrived at the Ueno residence in Shibuya district on 15 January 1924, where it was initially thought dead. According to Hachiko's biographer, Prof Mayumi Itoh, Ueno and his wife Yae nursed him back to health over the next six months. Ueno named him Hachi, or eight in Japanese. Ko is an honorific bestowed by Ueno's students. Ueno took a train to work several times a week. He was accompanied to Shibuya station by his three dogs, including Hachiko. The trio would then wait there for his return in the evening. On 21 May 1925, Ueno, then 53, died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Hachiko had been with him for just 16 months. \"While people were attending the wake, Hachi smelled Dr Ueno from the house and went inside the living room. He crawled under the coffin and refused to move,\" writes Prof Itoh. Hachiko spent the next few months with different families outside Shibuya but eventually, in the summer of 1925, he ended up with Ueno's gardener Kikusaburo Kobayashi. Having returned to the area where his late master lived, Hachiko soon resumed his daily commute to the station, rain or shine. \"In the evening, Hachi stood on four legs at the ticket gate and looked at each passenger as if he were looking for someone,\" writes Prof Itoh. Station employees initially saw him as a nuisance. Yakitori vendors would pour water on him and little boys bullied and hit him. However, he gained nationwide fame after Japanese daily Tokyo Asahi Shimbun wrote about him in October 1932. The station received donations of food for Hachiko each day, while visitors came from far and wide to see him. Poems and haikus were written about him. A fundraising event in 1934 to make a statue of him reportedly drew a crowd of 3,000. Hachiko's eventual death on 8 March 1935 made the front page of many newspapers. At his funeral, Buddhist monks offered prayers for him and dignitaries read eulogies. Thousands visited his statue in the following days. In impoverished post-war Japan, a fundraising drive for a new statue of Hachiko even managed to raise 800,000 yen, an enormous sum at the time, worth about 4bn yen (\u00a322m; $28m) today. \"In retrospect, I feel that he knew that Dr Ueno would not come back, but he kept waiting - Hachiko taught us the value of keeping faith in someone,\" wrote Takeshi Okamoto in a newspaper article in 1982. As a high school student, he had seen Hachiko at the station daily. Remembering Hachiko Every year on 8 April, a memorial service for Hachiko is held outside Shibuya Station. His statue is often decorated with scarves, Santa hats and, most recently, a surgical mask. His mount is on display at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo. Some of his remains are interred at the Aoyama Cemetery, alongside Ueno and Yae. Statues of him have also been cast in Odate, Ueno's hometown Hisai, the University of Tokyo and Rhode Island, the American setting for the 2009 movie. Odate also has a series of events lined up this year for his 100th birthday. Will the world's most loyal dog still be celebrated a century from now? Prof Yano says yes because she believes the \"heroism of Hachiko\" is not defined by any particular period - rather it is timeless. Mr Sakuraba is equally optimistic. \"Even 100 years from now, this unconditional, devoted love will remain unchanged, and the story of Hachiko will live on forever.\"",

        "title": "Load-shedding could switch South Africans off the ANC",
        "content": "South Africans are experiencing worsening blackouts as winter hits and the crisis is fuelling demands for political change in Africa's most-advanced economy. Wiseman Bambatha was indulging in wishful thinking when he named his business Goodhope upholstery. Mr Bambatha re-conditions sofas and chairs in a dingy, one-room workshop in the sprawling Khayelitsha township on the edge of Cape Town. But for hours on end, his battered, electric sewing machine sits idle. The power is off in Khayelitsha for eight or 10 hours almost every day. In South Africa they call it load-shedding. Orders are not being met, customers are angry. Mr Bambatha grimaces and admits his business is hanging by a thread. It is a story being replayed across the country. In an already dysfunctional economy, with half of all young adults unemployed, load-shedding is a jobs killer. \"The government has been promising us a better life for years,\" says Mr Bambatha, surveying his potholed street, and a vista of corrugated shacks beyond. \"Tell me, where is it?\" Khayelitsha is home to more than a million people. When night falls, and the power fails, it is enveloped in an eerie dark, punctuated by street-side braziers. Cape Town already had the dubious distinction of being the murder capital of Africa - load-shedding and the absence of street lighting has added a new level of menace. After sundown I meet Mr Bambatha's wife, Ruby, huddled on a sofa with her two young daughters, all of them illuminated by a flickering candle. \"I always try to get home before dark, get the kids inside and lock the door - only then I feel safe,\" she says. And even in death, the power crisis is robbing South Africans of their dignity. A man who runs a funeral parlour a couple of miles from Khayelitsha keeps bodies in a cold store behind his office. \"When the power is out for four hours we have a big problem,\" he says. \"The corpses start to decompose, you can imagine the smell. This is not something grieving families can accept.\" So the funeral director phones around his friends in the business. When he finds someone who has still got power and space in their cold store, he ferries his bodies to them. Across Cape Town, corpses are being juggled every day in search of reliable power. Load-shedding feels like the service delivery failure that could break the grip of the African National Congress (ANC) on power. The specific reasons for the rolling blackouts are legion: obsolete coal-fired power stations; incompetent management at the state-owned energy company Eskom and rampant corruption. But ultimately there is one stark political reality: the party of Nelson Mandela, which has monopolised power for 29 years since liberation from apartheid, owns this crisis. I meet ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula five minutes after power and light come back on at Luthuli House, the party's Johannesburg headquarters. He used to revel in the nickname \"Mr Fixit\". No-one seems to call him that now. \"Load-shedding could be our Achilles heel,\" he acknowledges, with surprising candour. \"It could cost us our majority.\" South Africans go to the polls next year. The poll ratings of the ANC and President Cyril Ramaphosa have been on the slide for months. The party is vulnerable as never before, but only if voters have a credible alternative. The leader of South Africa's biggest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), is John Steenhuisen. His Cape Town office gives clues as to the scale of his ambition. There are photos of former US President John F Kennedy everywhere. In a further nod to his political hero, Mr Steenhuisen promises me he will put together a \"moonshot coalition\" of a dozen opposition parties to bring down the ANC. But Mr Steenhuisen is white in a country where white people constitute just 7% of the population. Two-thirds of his party members are white. So too are 70% of the faces in South Africa's boardrooms. No amount of DA talk about competence and meritocracy can mask the fact that South Africa is not a society that has left the trauma and systemic inequality of apartheid behind. Which means that the most potent political force in the country right now may well be Julius Malema. He was thrown out of the ANC more than a decade ago - party bigwigs told him to take anger-management classes following a slew of accusations of inciting race hate and violence. He founded his own party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), committed to the nationalisation of land, the banks and the mines - in other words the key pillars of residual white economic power. Mr Malema senses opportunity as the energy crisis worsens this winter. \"Let the grid collapse,\" he tells me. \"I'm not wishing for it but it is going to happen, and then people are going to rise - I'm telling you there's going to be a revolution.\" The ANC has managed, or mismanaged, South Africa for the last 29 years. A day of reckoning is fast approaching, and it promises to be painful.",

        "title": "Zulu King Misuzulu kaZwelithini treated for suspected poisoning - aide",
        "content": "South Africa's Zulu King Misuzulu kaZwelithini is being treated in hospital for suspected poisoning, his traditional prime minister has said. The king sought medical attention in Eswatini as he is uncomfortable with seeking treatment in South Africa, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi added. This follows the sudden death of one of his senior advisers, also of suspected poisoning, Chief Buthelezi said. However, the king's official spokesman said he was in \"perfect health\". The monarch was currently not in hospital, and \"unnecessary panic\" should not be created, Prince Africa Zulu said, in what appeared to be an indirect reference to Chief Buthelezi's statement. King Misuzulu was crowned in front of thousands of his subjects last October. But a vicious power struggle has been raging within the royal family over the 48-year-old's accession, and tensions have also recently surfaced between the monarch and Chief Buthelezi. The Zulu king does not have formal political power and the monarch's role within broader South African society is largely ceremonial, but he remains hugely influential with a yearly government-funded budget of several million dollars. A faction within the family is challenging his claim to the throne in court, insisting that he is not the rightful heir of his late father, King Goodwill Zwelithini. They insist that another son of the late king, Prince Simakade, should be the monarch. King Zwelithini had six wives and at least 26 children. His will has also been challenged in court by his first wife, Queen Sibongile Dlamini-Zulu, and her two daughters. A court dismissed their case last year, but they said they would appeal against the ruling. There is no suggestion that any members of the royal family are behind King Misuzulu's suspected poisoning. The South African police have not yet commented on the claims. In his statement, Chief Buthelezi said King Misuzulu's senior aide, Douglas Xaba who stayed with him, \"passed on quite suddenly and that there are suspicions that he was poisoned\". \"When His Majesty began to feel unwell, he suspected that he too may have been poisoned. \"He immediately sought out medical treatment in Eswatini. I am informed that His Majesty felt uncomfortable seeking treatment in South Africa, as his parents had both received treatment in South Africa and subsequently died,\" Chief Buthelezi said. Chief Buthelezi added that while the king had recently appointed Prince Africa as the head of communications in his office, he, as the traditional prime minister, had an obligation to inform the Zulu nation of \"this worrying situation\". \"Our immediate concern is the King's wellbeing. We as the Zulu nation pray for His Majesty's full and swift recovery. \"Should there be any reason for further investigations, that will be attended to by the authorities,\" Chief Buthelezi said. In his subsequent statement, Prince Africa said there appeared to be an \"orchestrated agenda and a desperate narrative to communicate defamatory and baseless claims\" about the king's health. \"Ultimately, this creates unnecessary panic and perceptions of instability in the Royal Crown,\" he added. However, Prince Africa confirmed the monarch had undergone a thorough medical examination in Eswatini while visiting his uncle, King Mswati III. The checks were carried out because of \"our current times of pandemics such as Covid-19 and other dangerous ailments\", and also \"to mitigate against any untimely eventuality, given the reports of Mr Xaba's sudden passing\". King Misuzulu's accession to the throne was sooner than expected, and he has been at the centre of palace intrigue. His father died during the Covid pandemic in March 2021 of diabetes-related complications. He was the Zulu nation's longest-reigning monarch, having served on the throne for almost 50 years. King Misuzulu's mother, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu, then became the regent, but she died a month later. She was the sister of Eswatini's King Mswati III - Africa's only absolute monarch. At the time, Chief Buthelezi dismissed rumours that she had been poisoned. He had backed King Misuzulu's accession to the throne after her death, but recent reports suggested that sharp differences had emerged between the two. It followed a dispute over the chairmanship of the Ingonyama Trust Board, which manages vast tracts of land controlled by the monarch. The king appointed Chief Thanduyise Mzimela as its chairman, but this was opposed by Chief Buthelezi who felt he was inexperienced for the post, according to local media.",

        "title": "Deciphering Vladimir Putin's many appearances since mutiny",
        "content": "Where's Vladimir Putin? That's what we were wondering most of Monday - two days after a dramatic insurrection by the Wagner Group that saw a convoy of mercenary fighters headed to Moscow. A spokesman for Mr Putin announced a deal to end the Wagner mutiny late on Saturday. But when would the president himself comment on the controversial agreement? It was controversial because the Wagner mercenaries had rebelled, seized military sites (with apparent ease) and then marched on Moscow; Russian air force pilots had been killed in the mutiny. Yet the Kremlin had agreed not to prosecute Wagner fighters or their leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in return for calling off the uprising. Over the last week, President Putin has made a series of unusual public appearances - all televised - in an apparent attempt to steady the ship. On Monday we hear from Mr Prigozhin: an audio message posted online presenting his side of the story. He says his men headed to Moscow to \"hold to account\" those leaders he blamed for \"mistakes\" in the Ukraine war. Then late into the evening, an announcement is made. \"Standby: President Putin will address the nation.\" Now it feels like the Kremlin leader is playing catch-up. Putin appears on TV screens after 10pm. A late-night address from him is very unusual. Social media buzzes with rumours that this will be a speech that will \"decide the fate of Russia\". With trepidation we switch on Russian TV to hear the president speak. It quickly becomes clear this address will not decide the country's fate. There are no major announcements. But the five-minute speech does provide clues to how the Kremlin is going to spin the dramatic events of the weekend to its benefit. Putin paints a picture of a Russia that has united to defeat the treachery of Wagner's leaders. He tries to bring everyone on side: he thanks the Russian public, Russian officials, religious leaders, the Russian armed forces and his security services. He distinguishes between the leaders of the mutiny and regular Wagner fighters and commanders, whom he praises as patriots. Crucially, he presents himself as the man who averted major bloodshed. \"As soon as these events began to unfold,\" he says, \"in keeping with my direct instructions, steps were taken to avoid spilling blood\". Remember that controversy I was talking about? He doesn't address that. But, hey, Russia has stepped back from the brink. That's the main thing. On Monday he was playing catch-up. By Tuesday morning it's full steam ahead to try to restore his authority. At a hastily arranged event the Russian authorities are going heavy - very heavy - on the pomp and ceremony. Some 2,500 soldiers, Russian Guard and security officials are lined up on the Kremlin's Cathedral Square. This is the site of coronation (and funeral) processions of Russian tsars. Cue Putin: To the presidential fanfare he descends the many steps of the Kremlin down onto the square (red carpet all the way, of course) and with a backdrop of the onion domes of Kremlin cathedrals the president - and commander-in-chief - delivers a speech to his troops. But even before he starts to speak, the imagery says it all. It's all here in one place: the Orthodox Church, the Kremlin, the president and the army. It reminds me of the old Imperial Russian slogan: \"For faith, for the Tsar and the Fatherland.\" In other words, the visual messaging here is all about presenting Russia as a country uniting behind Vladimir Putin. It's almost as if they want Russians to think that the Church, the military, and the president are interlinked, even part of one whole. In his brief address, President Putin again claims that Russian society has come together after the Wagner mutiny. But most of what he says is praise for his military for \"stopping a civil war\". There's a minute's silence for the air force pilots who were killed. The president is paying his respects, but still not addressing the question of why Wagner fighters are not being prosecuted over their deaths. Speech over. Cue the national anthem and a gun salute. Overall message: the president's not only in charge. With the help of the Russian army and the Russian people, he's just scored a great victory. This is probably the most surprising Putin video of the week - perhaps of the year. That's because it's a very un-Putin-like Putin we see, in terms of getting up close and personal with the crowds. The official reason President Putin is visiting Dagestan is to chair a meeting on domestic tourism. But it's not the meeting that dominates news bulletins later on Russian TV. It's the crazy scenes that follow. The Kremlin leader is shown being mobbed by an adoring crowd in the city of Derbent. We've grown used to seeing Vladimir Putin keeping his distance from those he comes into contact with. Remember those long Kremlin tables with Putin seated safely at one end and his guests at the other? Not here. In Dagestan he's kissing children, hugging women, shaking hands and posing for photos. State TV laps it up. \"Screaming, squealing, applause,\" exclaims the presenter of a popular talk show on the Russia-1 channel. \"Even rock stars don't get this kind of welcome. The West is scoffing that after Prigozhin's mutiny the president has been weakened. This proves the opposite is the case.\" Putin's behaviour seems so out of character. On the other hand, nothing feels particularly normal any more in Russia. The Russian president had just survived an armed mutiny. Perhaps he feels the need to demonstrate - to the country, to the political elite, and to himself - that he still has supporters out there. A \"spontaneous\" expression of public adoration would fit the bill. As I view these images, I suddenly remember what happened last weekend, after the deal was done to end the mutiny. As Wagner fighters led by Mr Prigozhin had left Rostov on Saturday night, they were cheered on the streets. Has Vladimir Putin seen those images? Does he feel the need for his own \"hero\" moment? We'll probably never know. President Putin's attending a business conference on Russian brands in Moscow. It doesn't exactly make for another rock-star moment. Still, any opportunity to try to show (a) he's in charge (b) he's active (c) he has the support of the people. The Russian president is applauded as he enters the hall. He sits down and listens to one of the organisers deliver opening remarks. \"Vladimir Vladimirovich, along with you and the whole country we, too, lived through the events of 24 June [the mutiny] with anxiety,\" she says addressing Putin. \"We are all with you and we all support you.\" As if to prove it, the delegates give Vladimir Putin a standing ovation. From the same event, we see another slightly more bizarre video. President Putin is doodling on an interactive whiteboard. The result is a cartoon-like red face with three strands of hair. A curious picture from a leader who has learnt the art of political survival. Lines of loyal troops, gun salutes, screaming fans and a standing ovation. With these kinds of images, the Kremlin leader is trying to show he's back in control. He even has time to doodle. He must be feeling confident. Following the mutiny, we've witnessed a turbo-charged Putin this week. He was here, he was there, he seemed to be everywhere. It was almost as if he'd kicked off his campaign for re-election (his presidential term expires next year). But positive pictures do not change the fact that the rebellion had taken the Kremlin by surprise. It was a threat. The Wagner fighters had been well on their way to Moscow when the mutiny was called off. It was an unprecedented challenge to Putin's authority. And the long-term consequences of that are still unclear.",

        "title": "French teen shooting: Piecing together what happened",
        "content": "Prosecutors have begun piecing together what happened before the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Nahel M by a police officer. The officer has been charged with homicide and remains in custody. In their outline of events after questioning eyewitnesses and reviewing CCTV footage, prosecutors say the teenage driver had already ignored a police demand to stop, when officers caught up with the car and drew their weapons. Meanwhile an account has been posted online by one of the passengers, which French media say they have verified but the BBC has not. In this account the passenger, also a teenager, says the officers hit Nahel M with the butts of their guns three times, causing him to take his foot off the brake of the car. Prosecutors are due to talk to this witness on Monday. Here's what we know. Around 08:00 on Tuesday, two policemen on motorcycles spotted a Mercedes with a Polish number plate driving fast in a bus lane, Nanterre prosecutor Pascal Prache told journalists. Turning on their siren, the officers caught up with the car at a traffic light. Three young men were inside. The officers told the driver to stop but the vehicle pulled away, ignoring the red light. The officers gave chase and notified their unit by radio. At 08:16, the Mercedes stopped in heavy traffic. Both officers got off their motorcycles, drew their weapons and approached the car. They later told prosecutors that they pointed their guns at the driver to \"deter him from driving away again\". They asked the driver to turn off the ignition, but the car moved forward. One of the officers fired, fatally wounding the young man in the chest. After the car ran into a roadside barrier, one of the passengers was arrested and the other fled on foot. The passenger says the three friends were driving around Nanterre when the car strayed into the bus lane and was chased by two policemen on motorcycles. After Nahel stopped the car, the young man says in his video and in an interview with Le Parisien newspaper, one of the officers hit the teenage driver with the butt of his gun. He alleges that the second policeman also struck Nahel before the first officer again hit him. He told Le Parisien that the blows left Nahel M \"a little stunned\". The third blow, according to this account, caused Nahel to take his foot off the brake and the vehicle to move forward. After the officer fired, Nahel M slumped forward and his foot pressed on the accelerator, the passenger said. When the car came a standstill, the passenger said, he decided to flee because he was afraid he would be shot too. Questions have been asked about the car, a Mercedes A class AMG. Officials describe it as a rented vehicle. The passenger who fled said that someone had lent it to the three youths, without giving any details. According to the French motoring website Autoplus, German sportscars with Polish number plates can be hired for \u20ac300-3,000 (\u00a3260-2,600) a day. This type of short rental is popular with young men in French housing estates, Autoplus says. Nahel M did not have a criminal record but was known to police. He had previously been cited for driving without a licence - he was too young to have one - and for refusing to comply with an order to stop. He was due to appear before a juvenile court in September.",

        "title": "Nauru: Why Australia is funding an empty detention centre",
        "content": "Australia's controversial detention centre on Nauru is empty, after the last remaining refugee was evacuated into the night last week. It pauses over a decade of Australia's processing of asylum seekers on the tiny Pacific nation, with 4,183 people held there since 2012. Described as a place of \"indefinite despair\" and \"sustained abuse\" by visitors from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Human Rights Watch, the Nauru centre is a thorn in the side of Australia's human rights record. Yet offshore processing - which involves detaining people in the Pacific while they await resettlement in a third country - remains one of Australia's most enduring policies. Seven consecutive prime ministers have argued for its role in protecting the nation's borders and \"breaking the business model\" of human traffickers. Despite the facility sitting vacant, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government will spend vast sums of money - including A$486m (\u00a3255m; $320m) this year - to keep Nauru open as a deterrent. Maria knows what it feels like to be airlifted off Nauru at short notice. She was evacuated to Sydney in 2014 due to a severe kidney issue, after being detained on the island for over a year. A survivor of female genital mutilation from Somalia, Maria escaped civil war before making a weeks-long journey by plane, and then boat, to Australia. \"Just promise me: don't die,\" her younger brother had pleaded as she left the family home for the last time. \"That broke me\u2026 because we have lots of neighbours and cousins who have died in the Mediterranean,\" says Maria, who does not want to give her surname. Her time at sea felt \"never ending\", Maria tells the BBC. The boat was tiny \"like a kayak\" and its dozens of passengers had no toilet. \"I was hallucinating because I was so sick. I kept thinking about my brother. And how I didn't want to lie to him.\" Eventually they were picked up by the Australian Navy - and ultimately transferred to Nauru. Maria's memories of the island are vivid and intense. She describes having cut up and burnt feet after walking on sharp stones without shoes in searing heat. The humidity left her tent covered in \"green and black mould which grew on everything\", she adds. She learnt to move in groups and ignore public sexual propositions from men within the camp. \"Dehumanising\" treatment, such as being watched in the shower or rationed out sanitary pads by guards, became the norm, Maria says. \"There were a lot of inappropriate relationships between the guards and the girls. You're a refugee, but they looked at you like you were in a prison.\" After leaving Nauru, Maria was detained in Sydney, before finally being released on a bridging visa. She now runs a business in Brisbane, where she lives with her Australian husband and two children. But her visa requires renewal every six months and she lives in terror of being taken away from her family and placed back in detention. \"It's limbo. I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.\" Countless refugees have shared stories of suffering like Maria's since offshore processing began in 2001. It was introduced by a conservative prime minister, John Howard. When he left office in 2007, the policy was suspended by Kevin Rudd's Labor government, before being resumed - also under Labor - in 2012, initially as a stop-gap measure following a spike in boat crossings. Successive politicians defended the policy as key to protecting Australia's borders and saving lives at sea. But researchers have argued it did little to curb either maritime arrivals or deaths. Both dropped from 2014 onwards, when the government quietly shifted to boat \"turnbacks\" - an approach that removes migrant vessels from Australian waters and sends those on board back to their countries of departure. All new arrivals to the offshore detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea (PNG) ceased after that pivot. And since then, \"Australia has spent considerable effort and money trying unsuccessfully to extract itself from its arrangements in Nauru and PNG,\" a 2021 review of offshore detention from the Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law found. Mounting accusations of health crises among detainees prompted Australia to evacuate people from the islands under a special legislative scheme. As a result, everyone has been taken off Nauru, but 80 people formerly detained by the government remain \"trapped\" in PNG, according to the Human Rights Law Centre. Over the past decade, every expert UN body tasked with reviewing offshore processing has expressed concerns about the policy. Fourteen people have died in detention, about half through suicide. In 2020, the International Criminal Court (ICC) called Australia's policies unlawful and degrading but said they did not warrant prosecution. Despite quietly shifting away from offshore processing, Australia recently signed a A$422m contract with a US prison company to oversee Nauru until at least 2025. \"The enduring capability ensures regional processing arrangements remain ready to receive and process any new unauthorised maritime arrivals, future-proofing Australia's response to maritime people smuggling,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said. Mr Albanese has not commented on the last detainee leaving Nauru. His government has described its asylum seekers policies as \"tough on borders, not weak on humanity\". Critics argue offshore processing will remain a costly bipartisan policy on paper as long as \"refugees are being used to try and win votes\". \"People seeking asylum by sea have been weaponised and politicised over decades in Australia,\" says Jana Favero, director of advocacy at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. But Ms Favero and other critics believe public sentiment towards \"deterrence-based\" border control is shifting. She celebrates the last evacuation from Nauru as a \"long overdue move for refugees\" borne out of \"tireless advocacy\". \"What we saw at the last election was a rejection of fear-based politics,\" she says. Polling seems to capture some shift in attitudes towards immigration. In 2017, when asked whether refugees in Nauru and PNG should be allowed to settle in Australia, 45% agreed while 48% said no, according to the Lowy Institute think tank. This year, its polling found 68% agreed that \"openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation\", a 15-point increase from 2018. Maria, who has found herself caught in the crosshairs of the government's policy, says life for now is about co-existing with uncertainty - because so little has changed over time. \"It's been 10 years already\u2026 at this point, I feel like I'm used to it,\" she explains. \"I live my life as much as I can... but there are some days when I'm overwhelmed, and I think why me?\"",

        "title": "David Bowie's 1983 shows in Milton Keynes remembered",
        "content": "Forty years ago this weekend tens of thousands of fans gathered to watch David Bowie play three nights at a converted clay pit in the Buckinghamshire countryside. Fans who witnessed the gigs, from front and back of stage, spoke to the BBC about their memories. They came in their thousands from all across the country - with extra train services and coaches laid on to deal with the demand. More than 150,000 descended on the National Bowl in Milton Keynes that sweltering weekend in July 1983, on a tour that saw Bowie play his first live gigs in England in five years. I was among them. My journey, aged 15 and accompanied by a school friend, was on a coach from Cornwall. I didn't know it then, but we were about to witness the artist's transformation to a new level of global superstar. Alongside the die-hard Bowie fans, ska and reggae lovers had turned out to see support act The Beat, joining new romantics, punks and even a contingency of Hell's Angels, from memory. Bowie's new persona seemed to appeal to everyone, and it felt like half the country was there. The three dates, from 1 to 3 July, had been added to the end of the European leg of his Serious Moonlight tour, due to massive demand for tickets following the success of the Let's Dance album and its hit singles, including the title track. The nine-month tour had \"snowballed\", said official photographer Denis O'Regan, eventually featuring 99 dates in over 60 cities across the globe, including a series of massive open-air concerts. The photographer said he had been inspired to work with Bowie after seeing him a decade earlier at the famous Hammersmith Odeon concert, the night before the Bowie retired his Ziggy Stardust incarnation. \"That gig really changed my whole life,\" he said. \"I decided I wanted to go on tour with David Bowie, I also wanted to tour with the Rolling Stones, because they were the biggest band and I wanted to tour with Queen, because they were great, and I ended up touring with them all. \"I approached David with a business plan to produce a book of the tour, which he really liked.\" An early assumption the artist would keep him at arms length, being protective of his image, turned out to be the opposite, he explained. \"He was a very, very warm person and wanted to engage really easily with what I was doing, wanting me to cover every moment.\" His photographs document the transformation of the artist \"from the inside\", he said, \"it was an amazing time to be with him.\" As the tour progressed the photographer said he had to come up with different ways of shooting the star \"to hold David's interest\". \"If it was a shot of the live performance, it had to be very special,\" he said. \"At Milton Keynes, instead of the audience disappearing over the horizon they rise up in front of you, and that's what gave it that epic look.\" The resulting images were featured in US magazines Newsweek and Time \"and of course gave this impression of David being an enormous star playing to huge crowds so that really had quite an effect,\" he said. \"The rest of the world, especially America where David wasn't so big, saw this all happening and suddenly they wanted him, because they were booking into stadiums as well, so the tour took on a different level of magnitude and became a huge thing.\" An 18-year-old Chris Wilson had driven from Norfolk with friends for the first of the three dates, the day after finishing his A level exams. \"The day is still singed on my memory; we had pictures of Bowie stuck in the windows in the back of the car; that's how excited we were,\" he said. \"My god, he was on form and just looked amazing. He was shining and golden, the staging was magical. \"I just remember it being utterly euphoric because we'd waited so long to see him. \"His genius was, even in a massive crowd like that, you felt like he was singing to you, he was looking at you.\" A Manchester University student at the time, Dr Joan Keating said she had gone to the gig with friends as a birthday treat. \"I made a strapless dress out of yellow broderie anglaise and wore it with elbow length white lace gloves,\" she said. \"I remember that Bowie was very far away from the section that we were in, but that I felt grown up and glamorous and somehow in exactly the place that I was meant to be as a 20-year-old textiles student. \"I can still 'feel' the music.\" To a 16-year-old Nick De Marco, attending the gig with school friends from London had felt like a \"big expedition\". \"There were so many tens of thousands of people ahead of us, and all being young kids we didn't really think of getting to the front, but it was all very exciting,\" he said. \"But it is incredible when you do see the pictures of the enormity of that gig, and you just think, god, I was in there somewhere.\" Like many of us he also remembered the slow train journey back to London, arriving at Euston in the early hours. \"There was no way we could get home, so we all just slept on the concourse, it was full of hundreds of people doing the same thing,\" said Mr De Marco, who is now a lawyer. \"It was like there had been an earthquake or something.\" A 15-year-old Sam Rosser had travelled from Staffordshire for the gig, and said she felt \"slightly hysterical\" at times. \"I will never, ever forget that day, ever. I feel so lucky to have had that experience. I miss him so much.\" Dave Willis, then 17 years old and living in Woking in Surrey, describes phoning in sick to his employers in order to go to the concert with a colleague. \"Being provincial boys, we used to go to civic halls and leisure centres to see bands, so the thought of going to this great big bowl to see Bowie, and The Beat was just great,\" he said. \"It was so hot and of course we hadn't taken anything with us - we just got there and got down the front and then had to stay there, so we just spent all day in the sun with nothing to drink. \"I remember everything just being brilliant; every act was on point, and he came on and just blew everyone away.\" O'Regan now has a gallery in Hammersmith in west London, where he exhibits and sells limited edition prints and his published photography books, and looks back with great fondness at the time he spent with Bowie. \"On the tour we would have a slide show in my room once I got the pictures developed [as used to happen with rolls of camera film], and I really used to enjoy that,\" he said. \"I used to love it just me and David, and we often used to go out just me and him. \"It was way beyond what I ever expected. I knew at the time how lucky I was.\" Ricochet: David Bowie 1983, Denis O'Regan's deluxe box set including five books, signed and numbered prints, and exclusive vinyl, will soon be available to buy individually in unboxed collections. As the person who has photographed Bowie more than anyone, O'Regan is also working on a new book detailing his photographs of the artist across a 20-year period.

        "title": "Sex life of rare 'leopard-print' frog revealed",
        "content": "Scientists have braved 50C heat and poisonous snakes to track down a \"leopard-print\" frog virtually unknown to science and learn how it reproduces. Argentinian conservation scientists are fighting to protect the tiny Santa Fe frog, which is under threat as its habitat in one of the world's driest forests, the Dry Chaco, is cut down. They discovered it hides in caves, emerging only to call for a mate. And for the first time they found tadpoles of the species. \"It's not been an easy journey so far, but we're determined to do what we can to secure the future for this wonderful amphibian,\" said Isis Iba\u00f1ez, who leads the Santa Fe frog project, based in Buenos Aires. The Santa Fe frog (Leptodactylus laticeps) is largely unknown to science despite being discovered more than a century ago. Found only in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay, the frog is now rare due to the loss of the tropical dry forests in which it lives. The researchers set up camera traps to locate the brightly-coloured frogs and study their behaviour. Most frogs attract a mate by calling loudly from a pond, stream or swamp, but this species lives underground. The team found the males emerged at nightfall to advertise their presence, then hopped back down their burrows with interested females. After digging for hours at night they eventually found evidence of eggs and tadpoles for the first time. Investigating the frog's breeding behaviour is the first step towards protecting it in the wild. By drawing attention to the plight of the frog the conservation scientists hope to highlight the biodiversity of the Dry (or Grand) Chaco - and other animals at risk of extinction. \"This species is a clear example of why we have to defend the forest in the Dry Chaco,\" said team member, Camila Deutsch. \"We don't have much time.\" The scientists are also liaising with local community leaders, hunters and farmers to learn more about the frog and how to better protect it. The Grand Chaco is a large expanse of forest and dusty plains straddling parts of Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay. The Chaco woodlands have been gradually cleared over the past few decades to make way for cropland and ranches. The forest has one of the highest deforestation rates on the planet though it attracts less attention than its Amazon neighbour. The area has been dubbed \"El Impenetrable\" and even \"hell on Earth\" for its inaccessibility and extreme temperatures. Temperatures can reach 50C in the daytime and there is very little rainfall. Yet wildlife thrives in the harsh conditions, including hundreds of different birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians. \"It's a dry forest with an incredible biodiversity,\" said Gabriela Agostini. Amphibians are at high risk of extinction. A pathogenic fungus has been ravaging populations around the world for about 40 years. The animals are also under pressure from habitat loss and hunting. The Santa Fe frog project is supported by the Conservation Leadership Programme (CLP) - an initiative run by Fauna & Flora, BirdLife International and the Wildlife Conservation Society.

        "title": "California reparations: How do you put a price on racism?",
        "content": "Alvin Taylor and his sister, Pearl, were kids when the City of Palm Springs, California began burning down their neighbours' homes. But they still remember the smell of the smoke. \"We would come home, and a neighbour's house would be gone - just burned rubble,\" Pearl Taylor Devers said. In 1965, the City of Palm Springs began razing the Taylor's predominately black neighbourhood to make way for commercial development near the city centre. Their father, a carpenter, had built their modest home from the foundation up. Their mother, a house cleaner, worked for celebrities like Lucille Ball and Amelia Earnhardt and took the children to church every Sunday. The Taylors grew up in an area of Palm Springs known as Section 14; racial segregation made the neighbourhood one of the few places where black people could purchase a home. But that was before the fires. Every week a new home would go up in flames - sometimes with a neighbours' belongings inside. The Taylor family moved from home to home in Section 14, trying to outrun the flames. Each time their house was destroyed. After a lengthy investigation, a 1968 report from the California Department of Justice deemed the destruction of Section 14 a \"city-engineered holocaust.\" Nearly six decades later, survivors of Section 14 could finally see restitution after the California Department of Justice Reparations Task Force issued a sweeping set of reparations proposals last week. The thousand-page report sets out 115 legislative recommendations to address inequalities among black Californians and ensure that injustices - like the destruction of Section 14 - never happen again. Among the recommendations is a controversial proposal for cash payments of at least $1.2m (\u00a3943,400) to each black descendant of slaves. Members of the task force said they hope their report helps the public understand the true cost of racism in California, regardless of whether the government ends up deciding to give direct cash payments or not. The issue is highly divisive in the state. A new poll from the Public Policy Institute of California found that 54% of likely California voters had an unfavourable view of the task force, while nearly the same amount, 59%, believe the state should offer a formal apology for human rights violations and crimes against humanity on African slaves and their descendants. The atmosphere was charged on Thursday, when the report was presented to the public, with some saying payments could not come soon enough. \"It's my money, and I want it now,\" one woman yelled. Others others said it was unfair to ask this generation to pay for the sins of the past through reparations that will ultimately be funded by tax dollars. California Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli, who is Lebanese-American, said he opposes the recommendations of the task force because \"This whole thing of focusing on people's race and victimhood, [and] is nothing but an attempt to divide Americans and pit them against each other,\" he told the BBC. This debate is nothing new. Americans have argued over the idea of reparations since the end of the Civil War. In recent years since, members of Congress have tried - and failed - to establish a commission to study proposals for reparations for African Americans. While reparations efforts might have stalled on the federal level, local discussions have intensified, especially in the years since the murder of George Floyd. Evanston, Illinois became the first city in the US to give financial compensation for racist housing discrimination. But California's plan, if implemented, would be the most sweeping to date. Dr Cheryl Grills, a clinical psychologist who specialises in racial trauma and was appointed to the task force, said it is necessary to acknowledge how the past continues to impact people today. \"Enslavement may have ended, but the ideology and the mechanisms to try to keep black people at the bottom are very much still with us,\" Dr Grills said. It's a lesson the Taylor's say they learned first-hand. They say the destruction of their home in Section 14 formed a core memory that would shape the rest of their lives. Their father, a proud man, refused to abandon the home he built for his family. He tried in vain to secure a loan to buy the land, but at a time when most banks refused to give black Americans mortgages, he was left with few options. He began to drink heavily to cope with the stress; eventually, Pearl said, their mother packed up the children and left Palm Springs and their father behind. \"We weren't there to see the actual day that he was pushed out of the home. I'm sure it was very traumatic for him,\" Pearl said. Mr Taylor ultimately died from alcoholism. As a young man, Alvin Taylor threw himself into music and channelled his prowess at drumming into a career playing alongside famous acts like Little Richard, The Beatle's George Harrison, and Elton John. For a while, success numbed the pain of losing his childhood, his home and his father. But when that stopped working, Mr Taylor said he turned to drugs. \"I was looking for an escape.\" After a years-long battle with addiction, Mr Taylor was sent to prison. Now, at 71, he believes the destruction of his home is the root of his struggle with addiction. \"Looking back, it feels like we were really treated like animals and disregarded as human beings,\" he said. Experiences like the Taylors are part of the reason California assembled the task force. But how do you put a dollar amount on the harms of racism? To calculate the cost, the task force looked at state data on the financial impact of harms in five categories: health, housing discrimination, unjust property takings, devaluation of black businesses, and mass incarceration and over-policing. The task force said this list of harms is not exhaustive, and may be added to at a later date, which could raise the total cost beyond the $1.2m person outlined in the report. Their calculations were meant to be educational estimates - an \"intentionally conservative\" effort underscore that there is a financial cost to racism in America. The challenge of determining just how much restitution would be paid, however, will ultimately fall to California's state lawmakers, who will vote on whether to adopt the recommendations found in the final report. They could decide to issue only a portion of the recommended amount, or compensate people in other ways, such as through loan forgiveness or other social programmes. The state is currently in a budget deficit, and some have speculated that Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, is unlikely to support a multi-billion dollar cash pay-out. Previously, he said: \"Dealing with the legacy of slavery is about much more than cash payments.\" As the child of immigrants, Assemblyman Essayli said he feels it would be unfair to force everyone in the state to pay for reparations. \"My family had nothing to do with slavery. California was never a slave state,\" he said. \"I think racism is just an ugly part of humanity and I just don't understand how we're going to quantify racism for a particular group.\" For Donald Tamaki, an attorney, civil rights advocate and the only non-black member of the task force, the backlash has been frustrating, but predictable. Critics, he said, have \"sticker shock\" because they're not used to framing reparations as a societal obligation. For his part, Mr Tamaki said he equates funding reparations to using tax dollars to fund public schools, even if you don't have children, Mr Tamaki said. But there is a precedent for cash reparations - one Mr Tamaki is personally familiar with. His family was among the more than 120,000 Japanese Americans forced from their homes and into government-run internment camps at the start of World War II. In 1983, Mr Tamaki served on the legal team that helped pave the way for the 1988 Civil Liberties Act, which officially apologised for Japanese internment and paid $20,000 to each surviving former detainee. \"For most Japanese Americans, it was getting their dignity back,\" he said. Years after the City of Palm Springs reduced their family home to rubble, Pearl and Alvin's mom was finally able to purchase a new house -- and the land as well. \"She was so excited telling her sister,\" Ms Taylor Devers recalled. \"She was feeling really confident that this home was not going to be burned from underneath her or taken away.\" That resilience and determination to not only rebuild, but thrive, is the essence of what it means to black in America, Ms Taylor Devers said. But it has come at a steep cost. Speaking onstage at a Juneteenth rally less than a mile away from where her family home once stood, Ms Taylor Devers encouraged her fellow Section 14 survivors to remain vigilant in their fight for justice and reparations. Standing just offstage, Alvin Taylor nodded in agreement. Later that evening, he cautiously picked his way across desert stones and scrub brush to stand on the concrete foundation that had once been his home. After 60 years, the parcel of land remains undeveloped. \"There literally isn't a dollar figure that could compensate for what the harm that was done. We realize that,\" she said. \"But I think that the idea that some type of restitution would be attempted to be made would be very helpful.\"",

        "title": "France riots: Why are police using guns during traffic stops?",
        "content": "The fatal shooting by police of a 17-year-old boy driving a car in a Paris suburb is the latest in a spate of such deadly incidents in France. It was the third killing this year during a police traffic stop and followed a record 13 deaths last year. Most of the victims have been of black or Arab origin, Reuters news agency reports. By law French police are allowed to shoot in five instances following a 2017 change in the law. That includes when the driver or occupants of a vehicle ignore an order to stop and are deemed to pose a risk to the officer's life or physical safety, or other people's. France's human rights ombudsman has opened an inquiry into Tuesday's killing of Nahel M, the sixth such inquiry since the start of last year. The officer involved has been charged with homicide. France is no stranger to unrest in its banlieues - poorer outer suburbs with high levels of unemployment and crime - and police say they are facing increasing levels of violence. In 2016, in a housing estate outside of Paris, an officer suffered serious burns and was put in an induced coma after a group of youths pelted his patrol car with petrol bombs. Police unions protested and demanded a strong response from the government. In response, the then-interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve vowed to change the law on the use of firearms by police, and the passing of Article 435-1 of the penal code followed in March 2017. On Tuesday police shot dead a 17-year-old boy of Algerian descent, named as Nahel M, as he drove away from a traffic stop. According to the Nanterre prosecutor, Nahel was shot after he refused to stop the car he was driving following orders by two policemen, who later said the vehicle committed various traffic violations and endangered pedestrians. On Thursday, Laurent-Franck Lienard said his client discharged his firearm \"in full compliance of the law\". \"He did not act outside the legal framework,\" Mr Lienard said. Last year a study showed that fatal police shootings on drivers of moving vehicles had multiplied fivefold since the law was implemented. Of the 39 people killed by police in 2022, 13 were drivers who were shot on the basis that they failed to comply with orders. They included Rayana, a young woman who was shot dead by police while a passenger in a car when the driver ignored a police order to stop. Critics argue the increase in such incidents is a direct result of Article 435-1, which they say is much too vague because it leaves officers to determine whether the driver's refusal to comply poses a risk. Henri Leclerc, president of French NGO Human Rights League, said the law allowed officers to be \"uninhibited\" with their firearms as it provides them with \"legal protection\" for shooting. Some politicians have also called for the law to be reviewed. Far-left politician Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon has denounced it as a \"right-to-kill\" law. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has rejected the criticism of the firearms law and insisted fewer people had been killed by police since 2017. However, a study by investigative media outlet Basta disputed this, saying that while 27 people were killed by police in 2017, that number grew to 40 in 2020 and increased further to 52 in 2021. Earlier this week Mr Cazeneuve defended the legislation, saying \"it does not at all give officers permission to shoot whenever\". The former interior minister told Le Monde that the legislation should not be blamed for police lack of professionalism or training. Speaking to the BBC, the Unsad-Police trade union's Deputy Secretary General Thierry Clair said an investigation would determine whether the weapon had been used legally. \"The key thing is the principle of proportionality with the nature of the threat,\" Mr Clair said. \"For instance, one of the cases refers to stopping a vehicle whose occupants refuse to comply and present a risk for someone else if they attempt to escape. \"And the incident we're talking about - in which a weapon was used - might fall into that category.\" In 2021 there were 37 deaths during police operations in France, 10 of whom were shot dead, according to the latest report from the police regulator IGPN - a figure that is lower than the number cited by media outlet Basta. That figure puts France at about 0.5 deaths per million people. Countries tend to report these figures differently, so it's difficult to compare. For example, there is a question of whether the death occurred during the operation or after it. But it's definitely considerably lower than the USA, where the figure was about 3.5 per million and Canada where it was about 1.5. And it's higher than England and Wales, where there were two fatal police shootings and 11 deaths in or following police custody in 2021-22. That is about 0.2 deaths per million.

        "title": "Ukraine finds British WW2 Hurricane planes outside Kyiv",
        "content": "The rusting remains of eight British Hurricane fighter planes dating back to World War Two have been found buried in a forest in Ukraine. The aircraft were sent to the Soviet Union by Britain after Nazi Germany invaded the country in 1941. They were part of a package of allied military support for the USSR, paid for by the United States under the so-called Lend-Lease scheme. Similar legislation is being used by the US government today to send military aid to Ukraine as it seeks to expel Russian forces from its country. Aviation experts say this is the first time the remains of so many Hurricanes have been found in Ukraine. \"It is very rare to find this aircraft in Ukraine,\" says Oleks Shtan, a former airline pilot who is leading the excavation. \"It's very important for our aviation history because no Lend-Lease aircraft have been found here before.\" The Hawker Hurricane was the workhorse of the Battle of Britain - the air campaign of 1940 when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defeated German attempts to invade the UK. Although its role has often been overshadowed by the newer and more adaptable Spitfire plane, the Hurricane actually shot down more than half of all enemy aircraft during the battle. \"The Hurricane was a strong, easy to fly machine,\" Mr Shtan says. \"It was stable as a gun platform and suitable for inexperienced pilots. A reliable aircraft.\" In total, about 3,000 Hurricanes were sent to the USSR between 1941 and 1944 to support the Soviet war effort. Most were either destroyed in combat or dismantled later for parts. But some Hurricanes were deliberately broken up and buried after the war so the Soviets did not have to pay back the United States. Under the Lend-Lease legislation, the USSR was required to pay for any donated military equipment that remained intact after hostilities ended. This was the fate of the eight Hurricanes found buried in woodland south of Kyiv - now the capital of independent Ukraine, but until 1991 part of the USSR. They had been stripped of their instruments, radios, machine guns and any useful scrap metal. They were then dragged by tractors from a nearby airfield, broken up and dropped without ceremony into a shallow ravine. It is thought they were then covered with earth by bulldozers. The remains were discovered recently after an unexploded bomb dating from the war was found nearby. The rest of the ravine was checked using metal detectors and the Hurricanes were found. The National Aviation Museum of Ukraine is now in the process of painstakingly excavating the site by hand. Staff there aim to identify as much of the aircraft as possible so they can be reassembled and put on display. Valerii Romanenko, head of research at the museum, says the Hurricanes played an important part in Ukraine's history. \"The Hurricanes are a symbol of British assistance during the years of the Second World War, just as we are very appreciative of British assistance nowadays,\" he says. \"The UK is one of the largest suppliers of military equipment to our country now.\" \"In 1941 Britain was the first who supplied fighter aircraft to the Soviet Union in mass scale. Now the UK is the first country which gives Storm Shadow cruise missiles to our armed forces.\" It is thought there are just 14 restored Hurricanes able to fly in the world today. After the German invasion, the USSR lost many warplanes and was in desperate need of fighter aircraft. Initially several RAF Hurricane squadrons were sent to the Arctic to help. But soon the British pilots left and the aircraft were taken over by Soviet airmen. Records show that many disliked the Hurricane, considering it under-powered, under-armed and under-protected. By the end of the war it was considered obsolete and was used mainly for air defence work. The eight Hurricanes found south of Kyiv were used to defend major transport hubs - especially railway stations and junctions.",

        "title": "Prince Harry, Piers Morgan and hacking: What did the bosses know?",
        "content": "The seven-week trial into allegations of phone hacking by Mirror Group Newspapers journalists has come to an end. Is the evidence against the tabloid stacking up? At times during the hacking court case it seemed as though we had travelled back in time, to the days before social media, when people got their news from pages of ink, printed on actual paper. Back to the 1990s and 2000s, when stories about Prince Harry - barely out of school and falling for his first girlfriends - could fill newspapers day after day. The tabloids were also fascinated by soap stars. Two Coronation Street actors were claimants in this trial. Michael Turner played mechanic Kevin, and Nikki Sanderson, hairdresser Candice. The fourth claimant was Fiona Wightman, dragged into the red-tops by her marriage to Paul Whitehouse, whose TV comedy sketches on The Fast Show had catapulted him to fame in the 90s. What became clear during the trial was Mirror journalists didn't just make up their stories as many critics of the tabloids might believe. They pursued accurate reporting of celebrity secrets as vigorously as another journalist might investigate a corrupt politician. But their most precious commodity was sensitive personal information, some of it obtained illicitly from phone hacking. This is no longer disputed by the newspapers, because this trial was not the first. In 2015, the publisher of the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People (now known as Reach PLC) admitted journalists used phone hacking and other unlawful methods during a previous landmark case, brought by another Coronation Street actor, Shobna Gulati and others. The High Court judge, Mr Justice Mann, ruled that for seven years, from 1999, there had been \"widespread, institutionalised and long-standing\" phone hacking at the newspapers and editors knew - in particular, the editor of the Sunday Mirror, Tina Weaver. The publisher apologised. In the latest trial, which concluded on Friday, the claimants were trying to expand the legal action to more potential victims, and prove the scandal reached the top of Mirror Group - to its board and its lawyers. If Mr Justice Fancourt finds they knew - and did nothing - the company could be hit with massive bills for compensation. During this trial, the claimants attempted to make a new case against Piers Morgan, the television presenter who was Mirror editor between 1995 and 2004, who had emerged largely unscathed from the 2015 trial. They brought together a series of incidents, which they said suggested he knew quite a lot about phone hacking and blagging - the reckless obtaining of personal information such as addresses, phone bills or bank statements - in the hope of creating an unbreakable thread of evidence. There was the lunch where Mr Morgan urged a phone company executive to tell his customers they should change the PIN numbers on their mobiles, because journalists could listen to their voicemail messages. There was the former intern who told the court he overheard a journalist reassuring Mr Morgan that a story about the singer Kylie Minogue was accurate because it had come from her voicemails. A former Guardian journalist who said in a statement that Mr Morgan had explained to him most people didn't change the default access code for their voicemails, so they were easy to guess. And the agent for TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson, who couldn't work out why Mr Morgan seemed to know so much about her client. But neither side called Mr Morgan to the witness box to defend himself. In civil trials, witnesses only tend to be called if they can help one side or the other. The Mirror Group argued Mr Morgan's appearance would have been an \"unnecessary distraction\" from the issues the judge has to decide. Remember, a key question was what executives knew. Piers Morgan was not on the board of Mirror Group Newspapers, the company said, and only attended two meetings over nine years. But towards the end of the hearings, the judge put Mr Morgan at the top of a list of 29 journalists who hadn't come to court and perhaps \"could and should\" have given evidence. After all, Mr Justice Fancourt pointed out, the former editor had been happy to talk about phone hacking outside court. Mr Morgan recently told the BBC: \"I never hacked a phone. I wouldn't even know how. I never told anybody to hack a phone.\" He also insisted he didn't know phone hacking was going on, but also that he couldn't be sure stories hadn't been published which used unlawful methods. But will the judge \"draw an inference\" that Mr Morgan not giving evidence suggests he was involved? He could decide he doesn't have to make any ruling at all about the former editor. So what else did we learn? The trial lifted the lid on a network of private investigators, or PIs, who specialised in feeding personal information to the tabloids. For the first time, a handful appeared in court. Ageing veterans of the information trade, sometimes scoffing at the questions they faced, sometimes confused by them. Between 1996 and 2011 the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People spent at least \u00a39m in payments to PIs. We heard that reporters on the Mirror papers regularly subcontracted the process of obtaining information to these PIs. A reporter might get one to find an address and phone number from credit reference agencies, or from the Electoral Roll, potentially breaching data protection laws. It was claimed journalists might use these details to hack a celebrity's phone themselves, or pass them onto another specialist investigator, who would in turn know the right \"blagger\" able to get more information. There were people who would pose as bank customers to get financial records, or NHS staff to obtain someone's medical status. Some were experts at digging through credit records, others at digging through rubbish. Literally, the contents of celebrity bins. The information would then be passed back up the chain, and presented to the reporter. The claimants argued this would allow the journalist to say it had been provided by \"sources\", and to deny knowing it had potentially been obtained unlawfully. Quotes lifted from phone hacking would be written up as the words of anonymous \"insiders\" to disguise their source, the court heard. Mirror Group's barrister, Andrew Green KC, accepted there were some investigators who broke the law - \"rotters\" as he called them several times. But most of the time they were using legitimate databases, he said. The three alleged victims of \"unlawful information gathering\" were chosen as test cases. Prince Harry picked himself as the fourth by simply refusing to settle with the Mirror. Their time in the witness box was mainly spent defending their cases against Mr Green. He tried to get them to accept that the stories the newspapers published about them must have come from publicly available sources, from friends, \"insiders\", other newspapers or even interviews they had willingly given. He argued the four cases had been \"wildly overstated\" and, in the case of Prince Harry, it was \"entirely speculative\". Unlike the 2015 case, Mr Green added, there was very little evidence phones were hacked or that information was unlawfully obtained. Prince Harry's approach in the witness box was to suppress his anger and suggest it was for the journalists to explain how they got their stories about him. At the time, he didn't read all 33 articles in his case but said \"every single article has caused me distress\" - saying they tainted his relationship with friends he suspected might be leaking information. The stories about him were so accurate he was \"incredibly suspicious\" they had been sourced illegitimately, especially by phone hacking. He was unable to say which voicemails had been accessed. It was all a very long time ago. The emotional damage done by tabloid reporting became clear when Fiona Wightman entered the witness box. In 2000, her split from comedian Paul Whitehouse and her cancer diagnosis were both of interest to the Mirror newspapers, which, it is alleged, tried to use a \"blagger\" to check her medical condition. Sometimes in tears, she told the court: \"I've had to discuss some of the most personal things I have had to go through. The most difficult times in my life.\" Being involved in the case meant, she said, that \"ironically it can now be reported. At the time I chose not to discuss any of it.\" Don't expect a quick decision about these cases. It may be months before Mr Justice Fancourt gives a judgement and more than 100 potential claimants are waiting on his words. It is now more than a decade since well-known people began to take on the newspapers they say have tormented their lives. Hundreds of victims have received damages in legal settlements and only MGN has been prepared to let the battle extend to a public trial. But the case of Sussex v MGN is not going to be the last trial. Next year, actor Hugh Grant will take on the publisher of the Sun newspaper. Prince Harry may join him. Round two for the Duke. And an even more aggressive legal battle is on the horizon. Associated Newspapers, whose top selling title is the Daily Mail, is gearing up to fight off new allegations made by Elton John, Doreen Lawrence - mother of murdered Stephen - and, of course, Prince Harry. They include the use of phone-tapping and bugs. The publisher has denied any involvement in what have become known as \"the dark arts\".",

        "title": "Paris riots: Suburban mayor's wife hurt as rioters attack their home",
        "content": "Attackers in France tried to set fire to the home of a suburban Paris mayor's home overnight and fired rockets at the official's fleeing wife and children. The incident has caused widespread shock and is being treated as attempted murder. Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne described it as intolerable. Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun was not at home, but his wife suffered a broken leg and a child was also hurt. France has seen violent protests after police killed a teenager on Tuesday. The suspects in the incident in L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses, south of Paris, have not been identified. Mr Jeanbrun said he had been in his office overseeing the situation when the attack on his home occurred at 01:30 (23:30 GMT on Saturday). The attackers used a car to ram through the gates of their home before setting the vehicle on fire so that the blaze would spread to the house, the mayor said in a statement. Then when his wife, Melanie Nowak, tried to flee with the children, aged five and seven, they were attacked with firework rockets. Mayor Jeanbrun called it \"a murder attempt of unspeakable cowardice\". \"A line has been crossed,\" he said. \"If my priority today is to take care of my family, my determination to protect and serve the Republic is greater than before,\" he added. The mayor, from the centre-right Les Republicains, has received widespread support from across the French political spectrum. The public prosecutor's office has started an investigation for attempted murder. The attack on Mayor Jeanbrun's home came during the fifth night of violent protests across France over the death of Nahel M, 17, who was shot by police at point-blank range during a traffic stop. Around 45,000 police were deployed in France on Saturday to control the protests and the interior ministry said Saturday night had been quieter, with fewer arrests overall. However there were more than 700 arrests across the country and more than 800 fires were lit by rioters during the course of the night, officials said. Mr Jeanbrun had urged the French government earlier to impose a state of emergency in response to the riots, which President Emmanuel Macron has so far declined to do. The French leader is due to meet with top officials later to discuss the crisis.",

        "title": "Orkney council to look at proposals to become territory of Norway",
        "content": "The Orkney Islands could change their status in the UK or even become a self-governing territory of Norway under new proposals. A motion will go before the council next week to investigate \"alternative forms of governance\". Council leader James Stockan said Orkney does not get fair funding with its current relationship within the UK. He wants to look at Crown Dependencies like the Channel Islands and overseas territories like the Falkland Islands. He suggested another possible future could be like the Faroe Islands - which is a self-governing territory of Denmark. Councillor Stockan told BBC Radio Scotland there were many areas where Orkney was being \"failed dreadfully\" by both the UK and Scottish governments. He said: \"We are really struggling at the moment, we have to replace the whole ferry fleet which is older than the CalMac fleet. \"We are denied the things that other areas get like RET (Road Equivalent Tariff) for ferry fares. \"And the funding we get from the Scottish government is significantly less per head than Shetland and the Western Isles to run the same services - we can't go on as we are.\" Mr Stockan said an in-depth study of the finances had never been carried out. \"We know that we have contributed for the last 40 years through north sea oil, and the dividend we get back isn't sufficient to keep us going,\" he said. \"We've got a unique opportunity right at the heart of all the wind projects round our waters.\" Mr Stockan is urging councillors to back his idea to find new ways for Orkney to get greater financial security and economic opportunities for Orcadians. Orkney Islands Council previously voted in 2017 to look at whether the islands could have greater autonomy. While they wanted to have a \"stronger voice\", they did not back full independence for Orkney. Mr Stockan's motion also cites British Crown Dependencies Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man as potential models to follow. But he warns that a large amount of staff resource would be needed to investigate the options and consult the public. \"The council will decide whether it supports this motion and from there we will take our time, because we don't want to do this emotionally,\" he said. \"We want to look at all the practical implications and then we'll evaluate the results. \"We are looking for the very best position for future generations and our place in the world. Mr Stockan also suggests that the council should investigate how Orkney could secure a \"Nordic connection\" with Denmark. Norway or Iceland. Orkney was previously held under Norwegian and Danish control until it became part of Scotland in 1472. The islands were used as security for the wedding dowry of Margaret of Denmark, the future wife of King James III of Scotland. Mr Stockan said: \"We were part of the Norse kingdom for much longer than we were part of the United Kingdom. \"On the street in Orkney people come up and say to me when are we going to pay back the dowry, when are we going back to Norway, \"There is a hug affinity and a huge deep cultural relationship there. This is exactly the moment to explore what is possible.\" The UK government said it was providing \u00a32.2bn to level up UK communities, including \u00a350m to grow the economies of Scotland's Islands - including Orkney. A spokesperson said: \"We will always be stronger together as one United Kingdom, and we have no plans to change the devolution settlement.\" The Scottish government said in 2023-24 Orkney Islands Council would receive \u00a389.7m to fund services, with an extra \u00a34.6m from an increase in council tax by 10%. A Scottish government spokesperson said it was \"committed to supporting island communities\". The motion will be discussed by Orkney Islands Council on Tuesday.

The campaign used images of rice terraces in Indonesia, sand dunes in the United Arab Emirates and an aircraft landing in Switzerland. The agency, DDB Philippines, apologised for the \"unfortunate oversight\". Philippine's tourism secretary, Christina Garcia Frasco, said no public funds had been used to make the video. Ms Frasco said the Department of Tourism had repeatedly sought confirmation from the advertising agency, DDB Philippines, that the materials used in the video were their own and were original. She said on \"ALL these occasions, DDB repeatedly assured the DOT that the originality and ownership of all materials are in order\". It was made as a part of a \u00a3708,298 (US 900,000) \"Love the Philippines\" campaign, which was launched in late June. The use of the videos from other countries was first uncovered by analysis by French news agency AFP and Philippine blogger Sass Rogando Sasot. Ms Frasco said the department would ensure DDB Philippines took accountability for the video. DDB Philippines said in its own statement that the use of stock footage in mood videos is standard in the advertising industry, but apologised for using other videos in this instance. \"The use of foreign stock footage in a campaign promoting the Philippines in highly inappropriate, and contradictory to the DOT's objectives\", it said. The video has been removed and the company said it would assist the department of tourism with its investigation.",

        "title": "Shell still trading Russian gas despite pledge to stop",
        "content": "Shell is still trading Russian gas more than a year after pledging to withdraw from the Russian energy market. The company was involved in nearly an eighth of Russia's shipborne gas exports in 2022, according to analysis from campaign group Global Witness. Oleg Ustenko, an adviser to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, accused Shell of accepting \"blood money\". Shell said the trades were the result of \"long-term contractual commitments\" and do not violate laws or sanctions. As recently as 9 May, a vast tanker capable of carrying more than 160,000 cubic metres of gas compressed into liquid form - liquefied natural gas or LNG - pulled out of the port of Sabetta, on the Yamal peninsula in Russia's far north. That cargo was purchased by Shell before heading onwards to its ultimate destination, Hong Kong. It is one of eight LNG cargoes that Shell has bought from Yamal this year, according to data from the Kpler database analysed by Global Witness. Last year Shell accounted for 12% of Russia's seaborne LNG trade, Global Witness calculates, and was among the top five traders of Russian-originated LNG that year. In March 2022, in the weeks following the invasion of Ukraine, Shell apologised for buying a cargo of Russian oil, and said it intended to withdraw from Russian oil and gas. It said that it would stop buying Russian oil, sell its service stations and other businesses in Russia,which it has done. It has also ended its joint ventures with the state energy giant Gazprom. And it said it would start a \"phased withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and LNG\". But it warned that it would be a \"complex challenge\". Since then, it has kept taking cargoes of LNG from two Russian ports, the one at Yamal and one at Sakhalin in the far east. Shell used to be a minority investor in the Sakhalin gas project, but abandoned that claim in September last year after the Russian government transferred its shares to a local business - and since then has taken no gas from Sakhalin. But it still honours the contract with the Russian LNG company Novatek, which obliges it to buy 900,000 tonnes a year from Yamal until the 2030s, according to the Reuters news agency. Novatek is Russia's second biggest gas company, and the taxes it pays are a significant contributor to the Russian government's budget. Oleg Ustenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said: \"It is quite simple: by continuing to trade in Russian gas Shell is putting money into Putin's pockets and helping to fund Russia's brutal aggression against the people of Ukraine. \"The vast sums that Shell and the whole oil industry have made in Russia should be used to help fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, rather than lining the pockets of their shareholders.\" A spokesman for Shell said: \"Shell has stopped buying Russian LNG on the spot market, but still has some long-term contractual commitments. This is in full compliance with sanctions, applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. \"There is a dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies. It is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made.\" Shell is the world's largest trader of LNG, which is not subject to European sanctions, making billions of dollars in profits trading oil and gas last year. Russia massively reduced its deliveries of gas by pipeline last year, but it has increased the amount of gas it supplies by ship, including to Europe. The UK has not imported any Russian gas for over a year, while EU politicians are trying to reduce the amount of Russian LNG the bloc imports. In March, the EU's Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson called on countries and firms to stop buying Russian gas, and not to sign new contracts. \"It's long overdue that the trading of Russian LNG is looked at with the same disgust as Russian oil trading. Targeting Putin's energy income cannot be about symbolic measures but must concretely put a stop to the huge fossil fuel sums that cement his power,\" said Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner at Global Witness. The France-based energy company TotalEnergies is a minority shareholder in the Yamal project, and was also a major trader in Russian LNG, the Global Witness analysis reported. The BBC has approached TotalEnergies for comment.",

        "title": "France teen's family tell BBC police use of lethal force must change",
        "content": "A relative of the French teenager shot by police has told the BBC the family did not want his death to spark riots, but insisted the law around lethal force at traffic stops must change. Nahel M was shot point-blank by police after failing to stop for a traffic check last Tuesday. \"We never called for hate or riots,\" the relative said. France has seen five days of violent rioting. Speaking to the BBC near the family home in Nanterre, the relative said the rioting - which has seen thousands arrested, shops looted and hundreds of vehicles set alight across France - did not honour Nahel's memory. \"We didn't ask to break or steal. All of this is not for Nahel,\" they told the BBC, speaking on condition of anonymity because tensions are so high following Nahel's shooting. They said they had called for a \"White March in the street. Walking in memory of Nahel. Walking, even being angry in the street, demonstrating, but without outbursts\". The relative said French authorities must now change the law that allows police officers to shoot during traffic stops. Nahel's relative called for \"better training for the French police, weapons regulation for police, and reviewing the law that allows police to use lethal force if a young person refuses to stop at a traffic stop\". France's penal code was changed in 2017 to allow for a broader use of firearms after police said they were facing increased levels of violence. Critics argue the increase in traffic related shootings is a direct result of that change, which they say is much too vague because it leaves officers to determine whether the driver's refusal to comply poses a risk. So far this year, three people have been killed during police traffic stops - following a record 13 people killed in traffic stop incidents last year. According to Reuters news agency most of those victims have been of black or Arab origin. Anais, a family friend and neighbour also told the BBC that being a young black man in France's suburbs meant being subject to racism, violence and racial profiling on a daily basis. \"They [the police] humiliate, insult and don't speak properly to them. And now they kill them! Nahel was covered by the press, but it's not the first time this has happened,\" she said. Nahel's relative said as a result of the ongoing chaos, the family had not had a moment to sit down together and remember him. \"We want everything to calm down. Social media, riots, everything needs to calm down. With all of this, we haven't had time to sit down for five minutes together and think about how he's gone now,\" they said. Earlier on Sunday, Nahel's grandmother also called for an end to the violence and accused rioters of using Nahel's death as an excuse. \"Don't destroy the schools, don't destroy the buses. It is other mothers who take these buses,\" Nadia, Nahel's grandmother, told BFMTV.",

        "title": "Inside Biden Administration\u2019s Semiconductor Training Programs",
        "content": "On June 9, President Joe Biden and the First Lady made a rare visit to the small town of Rocky Mount, N.C., a diverse enclave in a battleground state that his team believes he can win in 2024. It was the town\u2019s first visit from a sitting president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, drawing hundreds of residents to line the streets and wave as the presidential motorcade made its way through town. For Biden, the stop in Rocky Mount was aimed at persuading voters that his policies are bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. after decades of offshoring, as well as creating new, well-paying jobs that don\u2019t require a college degree. He was there to visit the Nash County Community College, which holds a new 96-hour course supported by government funds designed to help students pursue a career in manufacturing without a traditional four-year degree. \u201cLook, you can\u2019t have advanced manufacturing without a highly trained workforce. They don\u2019t go together,\u201d Biden told the assembled students. \u201cThat\u2019s where you all come in.\u201d But as the President travels the country to tout his economic vision, industry experts have warned that manufacturers may run into trouble hiring enough workers. According to a report from Deloitte, the U.S. semiconductor industry could face a shortage of about 70,000 to 90,000 workers over the next few years, in part because skilled workers and those with advanced technical degrees are choosing to work at big technology firms instead of manufacturing facilities. McKinsey has also projected a shortage of 90,000 skilled technicians in the U.S. by 2030. The Commerce Department is aware of the looming issue: \u201cWe really have to just get a lot more serious about it, and also develop new pipelines,\u201d Secretary Gina Raimondo said at a summit on April 18. \u201cThe forecasts are that we\u2019ll be about 100,000 semiconductor technicians short in the next handful of years, if we don\u2019t do something differently. That\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d When asked if the Administration is worried that there won\u2019t be enough workers to fill all the jobs created by the CHIPS and Science Act, a senior Commerce Department official responded: \u201cLook, it\u2019s a challenge and our job here is to address the challenge.\u201d Biden may also have misled prospective applicants on salary expectations. In his most recent State of the Union address, he said the CHIPS Act has created jobs that pay an average of $130,000 a year, many of which do not require a college degree. But company representatives from Intel, the company responsible for many of the workforce training programs launched so far, note that the $130,000 figure that Biden officials have touted is an average amount that could be skewed by management and employees with advanced degrees. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that every job is going to pay six figures,\u201d a separate senior Biden Administration official says. \u201cThat\u2019s the average. When you aggregate all the jobs\u2014the four-year degree jobs, the two years, the training certificates\u2014you will get a number like $135,000\u2026 But of course it\u2019s a mix of jobs.\u201d Still, having more jobs than workers\u2014and a plan to address the shortfall\u2014isn\u2019t a bad place to be politically, and the Biden Administration is hopeful that it can blunt a possible workforce shortage and bring crucial manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. to compete with China. Across the country, community colleges, universities, and school districts have been creating or expanding training programs to attract more students to the semiconductor industry, which experts say is on the cusp of a manufacturing boom. To receive a slice of the federal subsidies under the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Department is requiring companies to submit applications that include detailed plans about how they will recruit and retain workers, prompting a new wave of workforce training programs. \u201cWorkforce development is a core part of our application and evaluation process,\u201d the senior Commerce Department official says. \u201cIt\u2019s really important on a regional and local basis to build the workforce necessary to fill these jobs. Partnerships with university systems, community colleges, workforce and labor organizations\u2014these are all the types of things that we are expecting our applicants to see.\u201d In Maricopa County, Ariz., outside Phoenix, three community colleges have partnered with Intel to offer a \u201cQuick Start\u201d program aimed at preparing students to become entry-level technicians at Intel, its suppliers, or other semiconductor manufacturers in just 10 days, funded by a grant from the Arizona Commerce Authority and at no cost to the students if they complete the course. Students who graduated from the boot camp told TIME that they were taught the basics of how chips are made, practiced using various hand tools, and tried on the head-to-toe gowns (called \u201cbunny suits\u201d) that technicians wear to prevent stray lint or hair from damaging the wafers. Even a speck of dust can ruin the chip-making process. Lisa Strothers, a 35-year-old from Phoenix, Ariz., had just been laid off from her job as a loan support specialist when she received an email about the program. \u201cBegin your exciting new career with only 10 days of training,\u201d the message read. It was a path she had never considered, given her non-technical background, but she decided to give it a try. \u201cIt was a lot of information in a short period of time, but they tried to make it very basic so you can still understand,\u201d Strothers says. \u201cOnly one or two people had some type of technology background in our class; the rest of us did not.\u201d Just a few weeks after completing the 10-day program and passing a certification exam, she applied for a job at Intel and was hired as a process technician, responsible for helping troubleshoot equipment and tools. Intel says that demand for the Quick Start program is so high that it had to put hundreds of people on a waiting list just to enroll in the program at its two locations in Phoenix and Portland, Ore. In February, Intel launched a similar \u201crapid\u201d certification program in Ohio, where the company is breaking ground on its planned $20 billion semiconductor facilities set to open in 2025 and employ 3,000 people and require 7,000 construction workers to build. The Ohio program currently has 260 registered students. \u201cThe question of how we scale and how we serve that level of interest is one in our minds right now,\u201d says Gabriela Cruz Thompson, Intel\u2019s director of University Research Collaboration. \u201cQuick Start is still in pilot program mode. We don\u2019t want to over scale and then under serve the students. We want to hear a little bit more from the community in terms of what skills people are getting and make the appropriate adjustments as we might scale this into the future.\u201d So far, the training program has served more than 600 students in Arizona since it began in July 2022. Patty Mfoloe, a graduate of the Portland program after she was laid off from her job in the healthcare sector, said the 10-day bootcamp was challenging at first, but it allowed her to learn more about the chips that run nearly every piece of technology we use. \u201cIt was one of the things that I\u2019ve never done in my life,\u201d says Mfoloe, who now works for Intel as a manufacturing technician in which she\u2019s responsible for the tools that create chips. The average annual income of program graduates upon job placement is $43,000, according to Fresh Start, a Phoenix-based nonprofit women\u2019s foundation that partnered on the initiative with Intel and Mesa Community College. In Oregon, an advertisement for the workforce training program claimed entry level semiconductor technicians earn between $18 and $24 per hour, which translates to an annual salary range of roughly $37,000 to $50,000. Intel claims the training program is just a starting point for a career in the semiconductor manufacturing industry that the Biden Administration is hoping will be better equipped to compete with China and Taiwan, which have dominated the chips race for several decades. Semiconductors were invented in the U.S., but many manufacturers moved their facilities overseas in search of cheaper labor costs and incentives from foreign governments, dragging the U.S. share of chip production down to about 12% today from 37% in the 1990s. To attract chipmakers back to the U.S., Biden signed into law last summer the CHIPS and Science Act, which centers on $52 billion in subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. It has already sparked an outpouring of new private investments in chip plants around the nation, most of which are outside big cities and seek to catalyze economic growth in parts of the country that could use a spark. The challenge now is getting enough people to fill the jobs at those manufacturing plants. Training workers for free in just 10 days could be the key. \u201cI feel like the program is giving people a foot in the door that otherwise wouldn\u2019t even think about doing it,\u201d Strothers says. \u201cIncluding myself.\u201d",

        "title": "The History Behind the Barbie Movie",
        "content": "Barbie is an icon, perhaps the best known toy in the world. As Margot Robbie points out in an interview with me for a TIME cover story, the word \u201cBarbie\u201d has the sort of enviable global recognition only achieved by brands like Coca-Cola. Since her debut in 1959, she has been a staple of the culture, a touchpoint for pop icons like Nicki Minaj, and has become synonymous with a specific shade of pink. And yet it has somehow taken until 2023 for Barbie to make her live-action film debut. On July 21, the doll will finally grace the big screen. While there have been a number of animated Barbie movies and series on Nickelodeon and streaming services, Barbie will be the first live-action movie starring the doll to premiere in theaters. Margot Robbie will play a version of Barbie, but so will Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, and a number of other actors. Ryan Gosling will play just one of many Kens. Every image from the film, beginning with paparazzi shots of Robbie and Gosling rollerskating in spandex, has been dissected online, and Barbiecore has never been hotter. Read More: How Barbie Came to Life It\u2019s officially the summer of Barbie. But the journey here was complicated. In the eight years I have spent reporting on Mattel, other potential Barbie movies have come and gone. The toy company and filmmakers struggled with how to deal with Barbie\u2019s baggage: The traditionally thin-waisted, blonde-haired doll has long been criticized for setting unrealistic body standards. Even after Mattel introduced a Curvy Barbie in 2016 (a major change I documented in a TIME cover story), the original Barbie has stuck in people\u2019s minds. Plus, Barbie is intentionally a blank slate upon which girls can project their dreams and desires. That makes conjuring one specific story for the movie particularly difficult. \u201cAs simple as an 11-and-a-half-inch doll looks, Barbie is a complicated brand,\u201d says President and COO of Mattel Richard Dickson. But when Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz took over the company in 2018, he decided it was time to commit to a Barbie movie. The film would be the first entry in a burgeoning cinematic universe based on the company\u2019s toys. In 2018, Robbie signed on to star and produce Barbie, and Warner Bros. announced that Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach had joined as screenwriters a year later. Here\u2019s the history of how Barbie made it to the big screen\u2014and why it took so long for her to get here. Mattel has been incredibly cautious when it comes to its most valuable asset\u2014and rightly so. Barbie has spent much of her history as the bestselling doll in the world. Barbie devotees would tell you that she inspires little girls to imagine themselves in any profession\u2014astronaut, president, veterinarian. But the doll\u2014and its creators\u2014have also been called out by parents concerned over how she affects their children\u2019s self-esteem. Over the years songs like Aqua\u2019s \u201cBarbie Girl\u201d and even throwaway lines in movies like Legally Blonde\u2014when a Harvard Law student disdainfully calls Elle Woods \u201cMalibu Barbie\u201d\u2014have not exactly bolstered Barbie\u2019s reputation as a figure of female empowerment. Any portrayal of Barbie onscreen would be inherently fraught, and the company hasn\u2019t always had a sense of humor about its iconic doll. When Barbie appeared as a supporting character in Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 4 in the 2010s, Mattel creatives emphasized to me that it was a big a deal the company ceded any control to Pixar and allowed the studio to poke fun at Barbie and Ken. Years earlier, Mattel sued Aqua over \u201cBarbie Girl.\u201d Cut to 2023, and one of the most eagerly anticipated songs on the Barbie soundtrack is Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice\u2019s \u201cBarbie World,\u201d which samples Aqua. When Amy Schumer signed on to play the doll in a live-action movie in 2016, the comedian had cemented herself as a sharp feminist voice in pop culture. Her Comedy Central sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, took no mercy when it came to skewering the patriarchy. She regularly poked fun at blustering men who didn\u2019t find her \u201chot enough\u201d and companies that exploited women in order to sell them products. It was difficult to imagine Mattel, a company that had spent millions maintaining an immaculate image for its doll, would submit to Schumer\u2019s particular brand of humor. Mattel wanted Barbie to inspire. Any comedic take would inevitably take the doll down a peg. Schumer recently said she left the movie because that version wasn\u2019t \u201cfeminist and cool,\u201d as she assumes Gerwig\u2019s version will be. COO and President of Mattel Richard Dickson, who has been with the company long enough to see several potential movies come and go, argues that until Gerwig, the company \u201cnever found the right storyteller\u201d for Barbie. Mattel is now eager to prove it is in on the joke. In Gerwig\u2019s film, the company is run by executives who take umbrage at anyone who points out it\u2019s strange that so many men in suits are running a brand for little girls. And the movie acknowledges Barbie\u2019s complicated impact on girls\u2019 body image in exchanges with modern women we won\u2019t spoil here. Rae, who plays President Barbie in the new movie, points out that calling someone Barbie \u201cdoes have a negative connotation,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018Oh that person might be a bimbo. That person might be dumb. That person is superficial.\u2019 This movie presents an opportunity not to change that, but add more onto it and clear her name in a pretty cool way.\u201d Read More: How Greta Gerwig Got Barbie\u2014From the Clothes to the Dream House\u2014Just Right Gerwig also seems to have a love for the doll that transcends that of the typical filmmaker. During interviews for the story, she delighted in telling me about playing with the dolls as a child for \u201cway too long\u201d\u2014a giddiness that seemed to manifest in the world-building she did with Barbie. \u201cOne of the most endearing things parts of the process with Greta was her appreciation of the brand\u2019s history,\u201d says Dickson. \u201cIt was a matter of finding the right talent that can appreciate the brand\u2019s authenticity and bring that controversy to life in a way that, yes, pokes fun at us but ultimately is purposeful and has heart.\u201d But even signing onto Gerwig\u2019s version took some effort on the part of Mattel. Robbie Brenner, the first executive producer of Mattel Films, told executives they would have to \u201cwhite knuckle it\u201d through the creative process with Gerwig and Baumbach, and learn that a dose of self-depreciation can go a long way.  The question of who, exactly, would play Barbie was paramount. Mattel recently took great pains to modernize its doll. Nearly a decade ago, in 2014, Barbie had a very bad year: The Elsa doll from Frozen dethroned Barbie as the most popular toy for girls, and Lego surpassed Mattel as the biggest toy company. Sinking sales forced Mattel to rethink the brand, manifesting in the introduction of new skin tones and hair types in 2015 and new body shapes in 2016. Read More: Barbie\u2019s Got a New Body One of the reasons Mattel resisted putting Barbie on the big screen for so long was that they had worked to establish that Barbie wasn\u2019t just a skinny beach-bound blonde. There are, in fact, 175 different Barbies with different hair, skin tones, body shapes, and abilities. If Amy Schumer or Anne Hathaway (who was once also attached to play the doll) stood in for Barbie, an otherwise blank canvas would forever be connected to a single actor. If it worked, profits would grow. If it didn\u2019t, decades of Mattel\u2019s hard work would be undone. The idea that many Barbies would populate Gerwig\u2019s movie arose early in the creative process. In fact, it\u2019s what intrigued Robbie as a producer: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should say, \u2018This is the one version of what Barbie is, and that\u2019s what women should aspire to be and look like and act like.'\u201d A Barbie movie probably never would have come to fruition if it weren\u2019t for Mattel CEO Kreiz. In 2018, Kreiz took over the position at a moment of vulnerability for the company. He was the fourth CEO in just four years. He articulated a vision for Mattel that was rooted in intellectual property management. That plan included more streaming shows, games, a theme park currently under construction in Arizona, and movies. Lots of movies. An entire universe of movies. \u201cOnce you think of all those people who buy your product not just as consumers but as fans, you realize you have an audience and all these other opportunities become obvious,\u201d says Kreiz. Marvel and DC have found tremendous success making dozens of films based on stories that already had a built-in fanbase of comics readers. And it just so happens that film audiences seem to be tiring of superheroes. (Look no further than recent box office underperformers like The Flash and Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania.) Studios are now in search of other known IP that has not yet been adapted into film. Recent successes like Super Mario Bros. and Dungeons & Dragons suggest that audiences, too, are ready for something new, if still a bit familiar. Kreiz believed Mattel was sitting on a gold mine of well-known brands\u2014Barbie, Hot Wheels, American Girl, even the Magic 8 Ball. So he created Mattel Films, a studio inside the company, and hired Oscar-nominated producer Brenner to run the show. Mattel has since announced 15 movies, including a Rock \u2018Em Sock \u2018Em film with Vin Diesel, a Hot Wheels movie produced by J.J. Abrams, and even a Barney reboot with Daniel Kaluuya. But Kreiz determined that Mattel\u2019s first cinematic outing should focus on the company\u2019s crown jewel: Barbie. Just four weeks into his tenure as CEO, he requested a meeting with Margot Robbie, who he thought would be a perfect ambassador for the brand. Read More: Meet the Man Who\u2019s Making Barbie a Hollywood Star  It turned out that Robbie was as eager to meet with Mattel as the company was to court her. She thought Barbie would make sense for her production company LuckyChap. \u201cWe were kind of keeping tabs on the property for awhile before there was an opening, and then we could jump in and say, \u2018We\u2019d like to produce this. Here\u2019s how we would do it and who we would want to do it with,'\u201d she says, \u201ci.e someone like Greta\u2014Greta being the top of the list, pie in the sky, dream person.\u201d And then there was the creation of this Barbie, a process that wound up taking five years. The biggest challenge was dreaming up the right story. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a set narrative. I\u2019ve played characters where there\u2019s source material, comic books or if it\u2019s a real person, archival footage,\u201d says Robbie. \u201cEven with fictional characters, there\u2019s a story you end up rooting it in.\u201d Barbie, by contrast, has no personality by design. The idea is for little kids to project jobs and stories onto a blank canvas. So Gerwig and Baumbach had to build not just a character, but a story, and an entire world from scratch. Read More: How Greta Gerwig Is Leading By Example \u201cBefore Greta, we did hear many pitches,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call them generic because that wouldn\u2019t be fair. They were all interesting in their own right. But it was sort of predictable. You\u2019re thinking, \u2018That\u2019s not enough. We needed to live up to the legacy and the complexity.'\u201d What Gerwig has conjured up is certainly complex. She has fulfilled the presumed corporate mandate: Make a fun summer romp. But the film is stuffed with Gerwig\u2019s idiosyncrasies, from dance numbers inspired by Old Hollywood to Gerwig\u2019s personal preoccupation with stories about complicated mother-daughter relationships. Whether fans flock to Barbie will likely determine the fate of Mattel\u2019s future film endeavors. Kreiz hopes the movie will make a splash and put Mattel Films on the map: \u201cWe\u2019re looking to create movies that become cultural events.\u201d Correction, June 29 The original version of this story misstated the status of Mattel\u2019s upcoming film slate. They have 15 movies announced, not greenlit.",

        "content": "Apologies to the dudes who packed away their Allbirds and Crocs in order to parade around town with nothing but sweet air between their feet and the ground. \u201cBarefoot boy summer\u201d has been canceled. That\u2019s according to podiatrists alarmed at recent reports that people (men in particular) are losing their shoes and hitting the streets\u2014heading to coffee shops, hiking trails, airports, and anywhere else their hearts and soles might lead them. Social-media users on platforms like TikTok are sharing videos of themselves (and others) barefoot in the wild. (\u201cBe that primal, hard-to-kill man you know you are, and start walking barefoot outside,\u201d one urges.) The trend is even infiltrating popular media: In a recent episode of Succession, Lukas Matsson (played by Alexander Skarsgard) walks barefoot on the tarmac before boarding his private plane. \u201cI cringed,\u201d says Dr. Priya Parthasarathy, a podiatrist with Foot and Ankle Specialists of Mid-Atlantic in Silver Spring, Md., describing her reaction when she learned going barefoot was in vogue. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty much asking for trouble, and I 100% do not recommend it for a lot of different reasons.\u201d Research suggests that humans began wearing sandals or moccasins more than 40,000 years ago\u2014and there\u2019s a good reason for that. Footwear provides important structural support, comfort, and protection from a wide variety of threats, including sharp objects on the ground, pests, heat, and invisible germs. This seems obvious. So what\u2019s the appeal of ditching shoes? \u201cFor me, and for most people, it\u2019s getting more in touch with our feet as the foundation of our bodies,\u201d says Eric Cohen, 60, who lives in Sag Harbor, N.Y. He\u2019s been going barefoot in certain situations, like on the beach and while exercising, since the barefoot running boom about 15 years ago\u2014which surely qualifies him as one of the original barefoot boys. \u201cThis is what connects us to the ground. Everything starts from the bottom and works up.\u201d He\u2019s not worried about potential harms, and says the rewards outweigh the occasional splinter. The movement isn\u2019t coming out of nowhere: \u201cGrounding,\u201d an alternative medicine practice that involves putting your feet in direct contact with the earth, has been linked to benefits like stress relief and better sleep. And walking barefoot on carpeted floors can increase circulation and strengthen the muscles in the feet, says Dr. Miguel Cunha, a podiatrist who owns Gotham Footcare in New York. But he doesn\u2019t recommend going shoeless at the gym, communal bathing facilities, or outdoors, especially for prolonged periods of time. Experts speculate that people are trotting down city streets sans shoes more in an effort to look cool or edgy, and to show off on social media, than to reap any real health benefits. They advise caution to those intrigued by the trend. One of the biggest concerns is stepping on something painful or dangerous, says Dr. Jane Pontious, a clinical professor in the department of podiatric surgery at the Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine. When she first heard about the barefoot renaissance, she smiled, because it reminded her of childhood days spent near a lake, enjoying freedom of the feet and spirit. \u201cWith that said, did I have problems? Yeah, I did,\u201d she says. \u201cI had splinters several times. I had glass in my foot. I had a fishhook in my foot. Even being healthy and young, it wasn\u2019t the safest thing to do.\u201d Throughout her career, Pontious has removed many things from people\u2019s feet: wood splinters, glass, sewing needles, pieces of shells from the beach, even chihuahua hair (which is \u201cvery strong, like a tough fishing string,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s sharp.\u201d) She worries about hypodermic needles on city streets, stinging pests in the grass, and rocks and sticks on trails. If you step on something dangerous while barefoot, see a doctor right away, she urges. There are also less obvious threats lurking beneath your feet: You can\u2019t see them, but bacteria, fungi, and viruses are common in showers, locker rooms, pools, and anywhere else with a lot of water or moisture. (That\u2019s why experts suggest always wearing shoes before and after you get in the pool, even though it\u2019s a nuisance, and shower shoes if you\u2019re in a dorm or gym.) These microorganisms can lead to infections that change your foot\u2019s appearance and smell. If you have any small breaks in your skin, you\u2019re at an increased risk of developing an infection. \u201cWhen you go out in public outdoors, you\u2019re walking on surfaces that hundreds of people have walked on,\u201d Parthasarathy says. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re coming into contact with.\u201d Most people will detect signs that something is wrong within a few days. If you have athlete\u2019s foot, for example\u2014a fungal skin infection that affects the skin on the feet, including between the toes\u2014you might notice dry, scaly, or cracked skin; inflammation that\u2019s red, purple, or gray; blisters; or itchiness. It sometimes evolves into nail fungus, which causes toenails to become discolored, cracked, or even separated from the nail bed. Or you might develop plantar warts, small growths caused by the human papillomavirus. In that case, \u201cyou would look for calluses with black dots that aren\u2019t going away,\u201d Parthasarathy says. \u201cThey could be painful\u201d and are often difficult to treat. Going barefoot also presents a heightened risk of injury. Every year, people who mow their lawn barefoot run over their feet while cutting the grass, one of the \u201cmost devastating\u201d injuries podiatrists see, Parthasarathy says. Another risk\u2014falling down\u2014might be less dramatic, but it\u2019s still unpleasant, and shoes provide important traction and protection from slippery areas. That\u2019s especially true if you\u2019re considering going barefoot hiking, an idea that experts universally pan. Pontious has treated people who twisted their ankle or suffered a ligament sprain from walking barefoot on uneven surfaces. Plus, going shoeless for an extended amount of time can alter the biomechanics of your feet for the worse, Cunha says. Over the long run, this could accelerate the formation of bunions and hammertoes, or lead to conditions such as plantar fasciitis, shin splints, and Achilles tendonitis. \u201cThe main issue with walking barefoot is that you put a tremendous amount of stress on the foot, allowing it to collapse,\u201d he says. Another summertime hazard: sunburn. Our feet aren\u2019t used to being exposed to the outdoors, and we often forget to put sunscreen on the tops and bottoms, Parthasarathy says. Walking across hot concrete can lead to burns that are difficult to heal\u2014a particular danger for people with diabetes, who might have neuropathy, which means they won\u2019t feel their feet burning. They\u2019ll also take longer to recover, she notes. Not exactly, but there are safer spaces, Pontious says. For healthy people who are not immunocompromised and don\u2019t have underlying foot problems, the ideal environment is somewhere debris-free and freshly cleaned. The problem is that even indoors, we can never be certain of what\u2019s on the floor. \u201cI have people who live in what they claim is a very clean home, and they\u2019ll step on a staple that got into the rug,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so small that you don\u2019t see it until it\u2019s in your foot.\u201d That\u2019s also why it\u2019s ideal to wear water shoes on the beach. Tiny pieces of shells or coral, jellyfish that have washed ashore, super-hot sand, and shards of glass bottles can all ruin an otherwise sunny day. If you\u2019re determined to go barefoot, keep an eye on the sand and pay close attention to potential hazards. Pontious advises that everyone practice foot-healthy habits, including checking daily that there aren\u2019t any cuts, sores, blisters, or other changes to the skin or nails. If you sweat a lot, bring an extra pair of socks with you to work or outdoor activities. Halfway through the sweaty activity, wash your feet with a cleansing wipe and some sweat-absorbing powder, and change your socks (and don\u2019t forget to put your shoes back on). A final word of advice for those still tempted by the podiatric version of going commando: \u201cIf you embrace this trend, you better have your podiatrist on speed dial,\u201d Parthasarathy says. \u201cBecause I guarantee you will need it.\u201d",

        "title": "Biden: Putin 'Absolutely' Weakened by Wagner Mutiny",
        "content": "President Biden on Wednesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cabsolutely\u201d had been weakened by the short-lived uprising of the Wagner Group. But, Biden added, it\u2019s unclear what that means for Putin\u2019s grip on power as his war with Ukraine grinds on. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell really. He\u2019s clearly losing the Iraq war,\u201d Biden said, mixing up the word Iraq for Ukraine. \u201cHe\u2019s losing the war at home and he has become a bit of a pariah around the world.\u201d Biden\u2019s comments, made as he walked toward the Marine One helicopter to start a trip to Chicago for a speech highlighting his economic efforts, marked a departure from his deliberate and careful approach over the past few days to the unrest in Russia. As Putin faced a deadly rebellion from his own mercenary forces, it may have been tempting for an American President to gloat. But until Wednesday, Biden had bent over backwards to stay out of it, and worked to be sure key Western allies stayed out of it too. Biden was concerned that cheering on the unrest inside Russia would give Putin an opening to blame the U.S. for the privately-run Wagner Group turning on Russia\u2019s formal military forces. As reports came out on Saturday that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner Group\u2019s leader, had turned on the Russian military and was marching north with his mercenary forces toward Russia,, Biden pushed off a planned helicopter flight to the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland\u2019s Catoctin Mountains and stayed in the White House, where he convened calls with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom. The message: Don\u2019t give Putin an opening to blame outside forces for the internal mess. Biden\u2019s national security team was concerned that the U.S. and its allies could overstate the threat to Putin\u2019s hold on power, said a White House official. Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s National Security Advisor, canceled a scheduled trip to Copenhagen for a conference with Ukraine, and instead traveled to Camp David with Biden on Saturday afternoon to keep the President updated on events in Russia. \u201cWe made clear that we were not involved. We had nothing to do with it. This was part of a struggle within the Russian system,\u201d Biden said Monday afternoon in the White House. Allied leaders \u201dagreed with me that we had to make sure we gave Putin no excuse \u2014 let me emphasize \u2014 we gave Putin no excuse to blame this on the West or to blame this on NATO,\u201d Biden said. The measured response to Russia\u2019s instability is a strategy that takes a page from George H. W. Bush\u2019s careful approach to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, ever mindful of the dangers that unrest and a power vacuum would pose in nuclear-armed Russia. \u201cThe U.S. Administration probably took the smartest approach here because I think there\u2019s no doubt that this seems to be an internal issue, and I think it\u2019s pretty clear it was not even a coup,\u201d Molly Dunigan, an expert at the non-profit RAND Corporation who has researched the role of private militaries in conflicts. \u201cThis was what one of my colleagues has called \u2018a contract renegotiation gone wrong\u2019.\u201d Dunigan\u2019s research has found that when private military forces are deployed alongside regular armies, \u201ca whole host of frictions\u201d emerge, Dunigan says. \u201cIt can really negatively impact your military effectiveness over time because there\u2019s all this tension that erupts and lots of resentment between the forces.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s summer counteroffensive against Russian military positions holding large swaths of eastern Ukraine has moved more slowly than expected, as Ukrainian forces probe for weakness in Russia\u2019s frontline defenses. White House officials are watching to see if the Wagner Group\u2019s mutiny created enough disarray in the Russian military command to weaken Russia\u2019s ability to repel additional Ukrainian advances. \u201cOne part of Biden\u2019s wisdom was not to rush before it was clear what was going on,\u201d says Konstantin Sonin, a professor at University of Chicago with expertise in Russian political and economic issues. The biggest impact of the revolt may be felt on the front lines in Ukraine. \u201cThe main thing is that this was good for Ukraine and Ukraine armed forces,\u201d Sonin says. The Biden administration on Tuesday announced $500 million in new security assistance for Ukraine. That package includes more Patriot missiles for defending Ukraine cities and military installations from Russian air attacks, shoulder-fired Stinger missiles and HIMARS ammunition for downing Russian aircraft, shoulder fired Javelin missiles for destroying tanks, 30 Bradley armored fighting vehicles, 25 Stryker armored personnel carriers, and additional equipment for clearing mines. Biden spoke to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky from Camp David on Sunday. The two leaders discussed the Wagner Group\u2019s assault on Russian forces and Ukraine\u2019s ongoing counter-offensive operations. Biden said on Monday that he told Zelensky \u201cthat no matter what happened in Russia \u2014 let me say it again: No matter what happened in Russia, we, the United States, would continue to support Ukraine\u2019s defense and its sovereignty and its territorial integrity.\u201d",

        "title": "How Barbie Land Was Created: Sets Design, Costumes",
        "content": "Barbie is a movie that benefits from multiple screenings. On every viewing, you\u2019ll catch something different, whether it\u2019s a big idea or a tiny detail. When it hits theaters on July 21, every person who has ever dressed a Barbie up is bound to recognize some outfit or prop from their childhood, whether they played with the doll in the 1960s or 1990s. And even the Barbie agnostic will find something to pick up, whether it\u2019s references to the technicolor musicals of Old Hollywood or a famous scene from The Matrix. Filmed primarily at a studio in London, the story of Barbie begins in a pink wonderland called Barbie Land where there\u2019s an all-female Supreme Court, and, as Helen Mirren\u2019s narrator tells the audience, \u201call problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved.\u201d The Barbies celebrate their good fortune with nightly slumber parties. It\u2019s a lived-in fantasy world that relies primarily on physical sets rather than CGI. To build out Barbie Land, writer-director Greta Gerwig decided to create a coherent set of rules that would govern how it looked and functioned. In order to do that, she dove into the history of Barbie, the history of movies, and the history of fashion. For a cover story on the new film, Gerwig, producer and star Margot Robbie, and creatives at Mattel spoke to TIME about how they dreamt up all the details in the film. Over the course of 2018 and 2019, Gerwig, Robbie, and folks from Robbie\u2019s production company LuckyChap went through an immersion course designed by Mattel. The unofficial Barbie bootcamp began with the doll\u2019s origin story\u2014Barbie was created by Ruth Handler\u2014and took a tour through some of Barbie\u2019s best outfits over the years. Read More: How Barbie Came to Life This research served as inspiration for the story. Handler\u2019s relationship with her daughter Barbara (after whom Barbie is named) manifested as a plot point involving a mother and daughter in the film. \u201cA Barbie movie is only ever going to be a mother-daughter movie on so many levels because it was Ruth Handler and Barbara\u2014that was the relationship,\u201d says Gerwig. Gerwig and filmmaker Noah Baumbach, her co-writer and partner, also had to build a world from scratch. They came up with rules for Barbie Land to keep everything coherent. \u201cYou see a seamless universe that all makes sense, and that\u2019s because there were these very specific boundaries about what could and couldn\u2019t happen,\u201d says Kate McKinnon, who plays one of the Barbies. One such rule? Barbie Land is a utopia, so nothing can be cluttered. There is no trash. \u201cNothing is dirty in the world, even when it gets its most chaotic,\u201d says McKinnon. \u201cI was struck by that.\u201d Given that Barbie first came to market in 1959, Gerwig and Oscar-nominated production designer Sarah Greenwood decided to run with a midcentury modern aesthetic for Barbie\u2019s Dream House and many of her fashions. Barbie lives on the sort of suburban cul de sac idealized in that era. The Dream Houses were built without walls so the actors had to be attached to wires to make sure they didn\u2019t topple off the top floors of their homes when they got out of bed. But the cast says everything else in their Dream Houses was surprisingly functional: They would sit on the retro chairs and hang out talking between takes. \u201cWe all just wanted to kick it in each other\u2019s living rooms because they were so fabulous,\u201d says Alexandra Shipp, who plays an author Barbie. Read More: Why It Took 64 Years to Make a Barbie Movie Skipper\u2019s house is the only one on the block that\u2019s purple instead of pink. Leaves are growing out of the roof, and a swing is tied to a protruding branch. Technically it is the Chelsea Tree House\u2014nearly an exact replica, scaled up to fit human actors. In fact, everything in Barbie Land is built to a specific scale to look \u201ctoyetic.\u201d \u201cThe scale is not life-like,\u201d says Lisa McKnight, the executive vice president at Mattel whose job is specifically to oversee the marketing of Barbie and dolls. For instance, Barbie the character\u2019s Corvette is just a little too small for Robbie, just as Barbie the doll\u2019s convertible is a little too small for her: The windshield only comes up to her chest. Gerwig\u2019s team didn\u2019t just study midcentury furniture trends. The filmmaker also revisited the films of Old Hollywood to capture the look of those stories. Rather than using a green screen to ensure that there were only bright blue skies in idyllic Barbie Land, Gerwig\u2019s team hand-painted the backdrops to look like old soundstage musicals. In an early scene, Ken tries to interact with a set backdrop with disastrous results. Read More: Barbie\u2019s Got a New Body Many of the props on set were also painted by hand, from the trees to the pool that sits outside of Barbie\u2019s Dream House and contains no water. \u201cI remember even the bark of the palm trees had different shades of brown, green, and even pink,\u201d says McKnight. Barbie is filled with dance numbers that are heavily influenced by 1940s and 50s Technicolor musicals like Singin\u2019 in the Rain. During filming, Robbie\u2019s production company LuckyChap hosted a film festival of sorts playing movies that influenced Barbie. But Gerwig didn\u2019t limit herself to one era. The movie is stuffed with references to all sorts of films ranging from Rocky to 2001: A Space Odyssey to Clueless. Barbie Land comes to life in the details. Gerwig obsessed over it all, and the props that populate the fantastical space imbue it with a surprisingly lived-in quality, like a Barbie version of the book Moby Dick on a side table. All the letters in Barbie\u2019s mailbox have been scribbled upon in a nonsense language, like a child might write. Barbie devotees know that Pantone 219 is Barbie\u2019s very specific shade of pink. A giant Pantone 219 chip sits outside the Barbie conference room at Mattel. But the set used so much pink paint\u2014in that specific color as well as secondary and tertiary shades\u2014that it precipitated a worldwide shortage. The sheer number of pinks in every shot presented their own challenge. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have seen or will ever see a film with more pink in it,\u201d says producer David Heyman, who helped build another famous fantasy world with the Harry Potter film series. \u201cAnd then how to handle that photographically\u2014thank goodness we had Rodrigo Prieto, who was able to balance all that and create a beautiful and rich palette.\u201d The soundtrack is filled with today\u2019s top artists, but even the singers were chosen with intention. Issa Rae, who plays President Barbie, points out that Barbie\u2019s image among adults has been buoyed in recent years by Nicki Minaj, who has adopted the name \u201cBarbie\u201d as one of her personas. Minaj, along with Ice Spice, are the ones remixing Aqua\u2019s old \u201cBarbie Girl\u201d song in a wink to Barbie\u2019s influence on music throughout the years. \u201cMy Barbie association is Nicki Minaj,\u201d says Rae. \u201cSo it\u2019s dope that she is a part of this movie in some way.\u201d Beyond the Barbie immersion course, Gerwig and Baumbach did their own deep dive to dig up even more details about particularly strange or controversial outfits or dolls Mattel produced over the years. Robbie\u2019s Barbie and Ryan Gosling\u2019s Ken donned collector\u2019s items that we won\u2019t spoil for superfans. And, yes, some of the stranger toys show up in the movie too. The marketing rollout has already revealed that the pregnant Midge doll who quite literally popped a baby out makes an appearance in the film. (Emerald Fennell has the honor of portraying the unusual toy.) Read More: What to Know About Midge and Allan, the Deepest Cuts From the Barbie Movie  Oscar-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran was charged with replicating some of Barbie\u2019s most iconic looks. She had a direct line to Kim Culmone, the head of design for fashion dolls at Mattel, who in turn would dive deep into the archives to provide the filmmaking team with references. Every bathing suit and camp shirt was handmade and silk screened and completely custom. \u201cWhether it\u2019s 1950s ladylike attire or a Western Barbie and Ken look or the rollerblades, those looks stick out to me as really toyetic,\u201d says Culmone. \u201cAnd that was important because even though we were putting Barbie in the real world, there was always a commitment to serve the fans of Barbie with these toyetic references.\u201d But the specific touches are what truly made the set a work of art. At one point during the movie, Ken walks around in a pair of boxing shoes that are made specifically for smooth surfaces, which is fine because there\u2019s no real grass, gravel, or dirt in Barbie Land.",

        "title": "How Wildfire Smoke Affects Wildlife, Plants, and Your Pets",
        "content": "Authorities have urged people across swaths of the Midwest and Northeast to stay indoors as smoke from Canadian wildfires compromises air quality in more than a dozen U.S. states. Inhaling wildfire smoke can lead to health issues ranging from coughing and wheezing to more serious respiratory and cardiovascular problems, particularly for those with underlying conditions\u2014hence why officials have told people in affected areas to avoid going outside if possible, and to wear a good-quality mask if it can\u2019t be avoided. Officials in New York City, where air quality is particularly bad, have even enacted a \u201cwork suspension\u201d for carriage horses, citing unsafe conditions. That raises an important point: wildfires pose risks to wildlife as well as humans\u2014and animals often don\u2019t have the luxury of staying indoors, says Olivia Sanderfoot, a postdoctoral fellow who studies the effects of wildfire smoke on wildlife at the La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science at University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cAnimals, just like us, need to breathe,\u201d Sanderfoot says. \u201cIf the air that they\u2019re breathing is full of toxic particles, that is going to have an impact on their health.\u201d Just as with humans, animals may experience respiratory distress, inflammation, and poor immune function in smoky conditions, she says. Many plant and animal species have, however, adapted to survive and even thrive in wildfire conditions. Fires can spark new plant growth by burning up debris, improving soil fertility, and allowing certain types of seeds to germinate, for example. \u201cFires are not inherently a bad thing. Wildfires are a natural disturbance,\u201d Sanderfoot says. The difference is that now, largely due to human behavior and climate change, wildfires are growing more intense and causing more extreme and far-flung ripple effects. It\u2019s not yet clear how these changing fire patterns will affect plants and animals over time. But relatively short-term smoke exposure isn\u2019t likely to lead to mass crop or livestock death, says Gail Carlson, an assistant professor of environmental studies at Colby College. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s harmless, though. \u201cAir pollution is a major, major health threat, and that is true for anybody with lungs,\u201d Carlson says. That goes for pets too, says Lori Teller, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. There\u2019s no exact threshold at which smoke exposure becomes dangerous, as it depends on your pet\u2019s age and overall health, as well as the air quality in your area. But if local conditions are bad, Teller recommends keeping pets indoors with the windows closed (except for short bathroom breaks, if necessary) and looking for ways they can play and exercise inside. If your pet has been exposed to smoke, look for warning signs like coughing, gagging, panting, difficulty breathing, red or watery eyes, runny nose, fatigue, disorientation, and significantly decreased appetite, Teller says. If your pet is exhibiting these red flags, you may want to consult a veterinarian, who can treat your animal with medication, oxygen therapy, or other remedies if necessary. As for wild animals? There\u2019s not much humans can do to offer immediate help, Sanderfoot says, beyond investing in initiatives that support habitat restoration and conservation and supporting more robust climate policies. \u201cWe need to keep our attention focused on how smoke is impacting our communities and wildlife even when we have blue skies,\u201d Sanderfoot says. \u201cThe work that needs to be done to mitigate these events, and reduce risks when they happen, cannot be done just during the crisis.\u201d",

In the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020, you were eager, frenzied even, to do this work. A mere two years later, not only is that excitement for anti-racism work gone, the pendulum has swung in the other direction, into a verifiable whitelash against anti-racism work. If white womanhood is a house, your need to be perfect is the foundation. It is this need for perfection that makes it impossible to engage in antiracism work. Being perfect is the key to your happiness, to your success, to your very existence. Perfect hair. Perfect clothes. Perfect grades. Perfect nails. Perfect weddings. Perfect bodies. Perfect adoring and supportive wife and mother. Perfect employee and colleague. White skin. The foundational principle of perfection in a white supremacist society like ours is rooted in whiteness. Without it, your A\u2019s will never be straight enough, your MVP trophies not shiny enough, your flowery dresses a bit wilted. Of course, white skin alone doesn\u2019t render you perfect, but without it, you have no chance. White skin is a necessary (yet still insufficient) ingredient of perfection. The con, of course, is there is no actual recipe for perfection, as there is no such thing as perfection. Read More: How the \u2018Karen Meme\u2019 Confronts the Violent History of White Womanhood This makes your endless quest for perfection a trap. You will never be pretty enough. You will never be thin enough. You will never be smart enough or successful enough or rich enough. You will never be enough. Yet white women will die trying. Especially over dinner. We call it the \u201cThree Point Plan for Perfectionism.\u201d It goes like this: You\u2019ve been taught generation after generation that talking about politics over a meal is rude. Being rude is the enemy of perfection. Being perfect is your number one life goal, so you will not talk about racism. White women regularly mention having been \u201cburned\u201d on social media for saying the \u201cwrong thing.\u201d You have been publicly humiliated, often at the hands of a fellow white woman, who is angling to show you how much more perfect she is at antiracism work. Yes, you even compete in the antiracism space. Getting called out makes you want to stop the work, to stop engaging. If you aren\u2019t already perfect at it, then you don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. Yet if you stop the work, you can\u2019t make progress. Then there are those situations in which the critique of you is coming from a woman of color. This will hit you in a deeply uncomfortable place. After all, you are not used to having us challenge you\u2014and on a topic we absolutely know more about: being on the receiving end of racism. This, in particular, infuriates white women. Us publicly calling you out on your racism. Us publicly telling you that you are not perfect. Antiracism work depends on your acknowledging your imperfections, namely how you have been born into and nurtured by a white supremacist society. This means acknowledging that you are not the expert on how it feels to be on the receiving end of racism, which means you do not get to decide what is and is not racist. Just like men don\u2019t get to decide what is and is not sexist. It means acknowledging that you will get it wrong, that you will feel embarrassed, and that you will struggle to make progress. In spite of these obstacles and this necessary discomfort, you will have to pick yourself up and get back into the work\u2014work that is messy, not tidy. Work that is tables turned upside down, not neatly set. Work that is imperfect. So, why show up? Why do this work now? Because you must. You\u2019ll do it because not only is it the right thing to do, but you know that your lives, and your kids\u2019 and your grandkids\u2019 lives, depend on your showing up, even when things get hard. You will show up because you understand that white supremacy hurts you too. You are doing this not to save us, but to free yourselves. So the next time you think things like, \u201cI didn\u2019t pipe up on Facebook because I don\u2019t want to be attacked,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to say the wrong thing,\u201d or \u201cThe last time I called someone out at a dinner party, my husband was grumpy with me for a week,\u201d think about this: The only wrong move is remaining silent, sitting on the sidelines, accepting your role in white supremacy. Don\u2019t do nothing out of the fear of doing it imperfectly. Get in there. Read. Listen. Learn. Speak up. Speak out. Show up. Roll up your sleeves. And when you receive criticism, consider that maybe it\u2019s just that: a critique, and not an attack. Maybe this disagreement isn\u2019t a fight. Maybe you don\u2019t know more than the Black, Indigenous, or brown woman attempting to set you straight. And isn\u2019t freedom from white supremacy worth some level of conflict? Isn\u2019t it more important to eradicate racism than to be liked by everybody? You\u2019ve never been liked by everybody in the first place! In the end, you cannot even start the process of extracting white supremacy until you extract the need to be perfect. The need to be perfect is not just harmful to us, it\u2019s harmful to you. Aren\u2019t you tired of never being enough?

        "title": "How Wagner's Prigozhin Used Telegram to Challenge Putin",
        "content": "For nearly a decade, Yevgeny Prigozhin built a mercenary empire in the shadows. For eight years, he steadfastly denied his connection to the Wagner Group, the infamous paramilitary company he founded in May 2014, even going as far as to sue news outlets for correctly linking him to the group. It was only in Sept. 2022, after Prigozhin appeared in a video recruiting convicts to fill Wagner\u2019s ranks, that he finally acknowledged that he was the leader of the sprawling network of private military contractors and shell companies serving the Kremlin\u2019s interests from Ukraine to Syria to sub-Saharan Africa. \u201cThe time of revelation has come,\u201d Prigozhin said in a statement posted on social media, bragging that he had turned Wagner into one of the \u201cpillars of our Motherland\u201d and \u201cfoundation of Russian patriotism.\u201d Suddenly, the Russian oligarch and onetime Vladimir Putin confidante was everywhere. Prigozhin opened a Wagner headquarters in St. Petersburg, claimed credit for meddling in U.S. elections, and started posting hundreds of messages, videos, and photos on the messaging app Telegram. Over the course of seven months, the formerly secretive leader built a Telegram channel with 1.3 million followers, morphing from an unofficial extension of the Kremlin to a prominent figure with a direct connection to the Russian public. Prigozhin used Telegram to circumvent the Kremlin\u2019s state media apparatus, meeting Russians on the platform where they sought uncensored news from the war in Ukraine. As Wagner troops became heavily involved in the fighting, especially in the battles around Bakhmut, he became one of the most prominent faces of Russia\u2019s war, issuing a steady steam of often-graphic video messages from the front lines. As the war dragged on, he bristled at the Russian defense department\u2019s moves to subsume his mercenary army, taking on the country\u2019s military leadership and elite in screaming tirades that painted them as indifferent to the deaths of ordinary soldiers. When Prigozhin launched a dramatic insurrection against Russia\u2019s military leaders on June 23, he launched and narrated it in a series of stunning voice messages on his Telegram channel. Read More: How Telegram Became the Digital Battlefield in the Russia-Ukraine War. The short-lived mutiny pitted two skilled propagandists and former allies against one another. While Putin has tightly controlled narratives about the war within Russia through state media and television, analysts say, he may have underestimated the influence of Prigozhin\u2019s growing reach online. The following Prigozhin built on Telegram \u201cwas very clearly a method for him to be able to raise his political profile,\u201d says Catrina Doxsee, an expert on the Wagner Group and associate director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt became valuable to have all of that credibility as leverage.\u201d Prigozhin was once known as \u201cPutin\u2019s chef,\u201d thanks to the catering business he operated with links to the Kremlin. Back in 2016, he did Putin\u2019s bidding in a notorious influence operation conducted over social media: he was the person behind the Internet Research Agency, the notorious troll farm accused of attempting to manipulate the 2016 presidential race to boost Donald Trump. Prigozhin \u201cis a creation of Putin,\u201d says Joana de Deus Pereira, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute-Europe think tank. \u201cBut this is a typical case where the creation turns against the creator.\u201d The Telegram channel that would become Prigozhin\u2019s megaphone was created on Nov. 5, 2022 as the press arm of his company Concord Management and Consulting. Until then, a cluster of unofficial Wagner and fan accounts on Telegram, with names like \u201cPrigozhin\u2019s Cap,\u201d had distributed news about him and his group on the app, which had become the digital battle space of the war in Ukraine. Prigozhin would now be posting updates on this account, the first message said, so he could \u201cguarantee that all statements are published from me personally.\u201d The channel took off quickly, with dozens of videos showing the Wagner boss on the front lines. In January, one purported to show Prigozhin in a hospital, shaking the hands of Wagner fighters wounded in combat. In others, he stood in full combat gear on a rooftop in Bakhmut, demanding more ammunition. Prigozhin was \u201cbuilding a political persona in a kind of competition with Putin, to prove who was the most patriotic, the best Russian, the flagship of Russian values,\u201d says Pereira. He sought \u201cto be portrayed as a symbol of true patriotism and of the common soldier of Russia, the one that suffers on the field, the one that has blood in his hands,\u201d she says. Russian news, including state media, began to cover some of Prigozhin\u2019s videos on Telegram, even featuring criticism from his fighters, who complained about shortages of ammunition and armored vehicles. As Prigozhin grew bolder, Russian state-backed media outlets were instructed not to quote him unless it was about positive developments from the battlefield, according to the independent news outlet Verstka. \u201cWagner\u2019s relative successes tipped the balance of power in Prigozhin\u2019s favor [and] gave him room to openly criticize the Kremlin\u2019s strategy in the conflict,\u201d says Pereira. \u201cIt was something unimaginable just months ago.\u201d As the mercenary leader became more visible, he began to imply that any negative stories about him were being planted by the Russian military because Wagner\u2019s fighters were outperforming Russian forces on the battlefield. \u201cPeople in uniform could be discrediting me,\u201d he said in a Telegram post. \u201cChiefly those close to the military. Because many of them can\u2019t achieve the same effectiveness that Wagner has.\u201d Open criticism of the war is so rare\u2014and often illegal\u2014that it was widely assumed Prigozhin\u2019s comments were tacitly sanctioned by Putin, including his vitriolic barrages against Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, analysts tell TIME. On May 4, Prigozhin posted an expletive-riddled video on Telegram directed at Russia\u2019s military leadership, shining a flashlight on rows of bloodied bodies that he said were Wagner fighters killed in Bakhmut. \u201cYou scum sit there in your expensive clubs, your kids are all enjoying life, recording their little YouTube videos,\u201d he spat at the camera, standing in the dark, illuminated by a spotlight. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about basic calculations: if you hand over the ammo quota, there\u2019d be five times fewer [dead].\u201d Then Prigozhin took it a step further, posting a dramatic video in which he directly addressed Putin while dressed in full combat uniform surrounded by fighters. He threatened to withdraw Wagner Group units from Bakhmut: \u201cWithout ammunition, they\u2019re doomed to die meaningless deaths.\u201d He made good on that threat in late May, accusing Russia\u2019s leaders of intentionally starving his troops of munitions. \u201cThere will be no more meat grinder because there\u2019s nothing left to grind the meat with,\u201d he declared in a Telegram video. In early June, Shoigu announced plans to require soldiers with private military companies, including Wagner, to sign contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry by July 1. Prigozhin\u2019s screeds escalated as he saw his business empire threatened. He announced that his group would not comply. \u201cNone of Wagner\u2019s fighters is ready to go down the path of shame again,\u201d Prigozhin posted in a video on June 14. \u201cThat\u2019s why they will not sign the contracts.\u201d On June 23, Prigozhin accused the Russian military of ordering a rocket strike on Wagner\u2019s field camps in Ukraine, vowing to punish \u201cthose who destroyed our lads\u201d by embarking on a \u201cMarch for Justice.\u201d In a Telegram video, he attacked Putin\u2019s justification for the invasion of Ukraine itself, challenging his claims point by point. \u201cThe war wasn\u2019t needed to return Russian citizens to our bosom, nor to de-militarize or de-Nazify Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war was needed so that a bunch of animals could simply exult in glory.\u201d This was an extraordinary challenge to Putin\u2019s leadership. \u201cNot only is it a blow to Putin\u2019s narrative about the war, but it is coming from a trusted insider, who has already built up a reputation amongst the people,\u201d says Doxsee. \u201cAnd that is a huge blow to Putin\u2019s power and credibility.\u201d Wagner forces occupied the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, and moved north without opposition, advancing to within about 120 miles of Moscow before turning back. The Kremlin sought to block information about the putsch on Google News, appeared to cause Telegram outages in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Rostov-on-Don, and throttled Internet searches for Prigozhin on news sites and social-media networks. But the series of voice notes the mercenary leader posted on Telegram over the course of the revolt were still listened to more than 55 million times, according to TIME\u2019s review. Prigozhin has reportedly been exiled to Belarus under a deal brokered by the country\u2019s President Alexander Lukashenko on June 25, and his channel briefly fell silent. But on Monday he reappeared in more voice notes on Telegram. \u201cWhen on June 23-24 we walked past Russian cities, civilians met us with the flags of Russia and with the emblems and flags of the Wagner PMC,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of them still write words of support, and some are disappointed that we stopped.\u201d Prigozhin\u2019s future is uncertain. But as long as he has access to his Telegram channel, he will pose a threat to Putin, wherever he may be.",

        "title": "Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose launches GOP Senate bid",
        "content": "CLEVELAND \u2014 Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose launched a long-anticipated Senate bid Monday, becoming the third prominent Republican to run in an already fractious primary field that will determine who takes on Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown in 2024. \"I, for one, believe that the country is heading in a dangerous direction,\" LaRose said in an interview. \"If we don't turn the tide and put things back on track, then we're going to have a real mess on our hands.\" The race figures to be one of the most competitive in the country next year. Brown's seat, in a state former President Donald Trump twice won by comfortable margins, is among the GOP's prized pickup opportunities, alongside contests in Arizona, Montana and West Virginia. LaRose, 44, will aim to straddle two distinct lanes in a GOP race that features two rivals with substantial self-funding capabilities. Bernie Moreno \u2014 a businessman running with Trump\u2019s encouragement but for now without an official endorsement \u2014 is running as a loyalist of the former president. State Sen. Matt Dolan \u2014 a more policy-oriented conservative whose family owns Cleveland\u2019s Major League Baseball franchise, the Guardians \u2014 is running as an antidote to Trump\u2019s inflammatory politics. In his launch video, LaRose emphasized his Army service, saying he is \"a Green Beret, a conservative, a man of faith \u2014 and I'm not afraid of a fight.\" LaRose has championed a ballot initiative that would require a 60% vote \u2014 as opposed to a simple majority \u2014 to amend the Ohio Constitution. If the measure passes in an August special election, the higher threshold would be in place for an amendment to protect abortion rights that is expected to be on the November ballot. Moreno's campaign welcomed LaRose to the race by accusing him of shifting his focus away from a special election in which early voting is underway. \"Like a true career politician, Frank LaRose has spent the last 13 years of his life constantly running for higher office,\" Moreno spokesperson Conor McGuinness said. \"With the all-important Issue 1 vote coming up in August, he should instead focus on the job he has.\" LaRose, a former state senator, fired back: \"Has he suspended his campaign to campaign exclusively for Issue 1? If he had, maybe I would take that seriously.\" Democrats are watching with glee. \u201cThe Republican \u2018slugfest\u2019 for Ohio\u2019s Senate seat is shaping up to be another long, contentious battle that will leave whoever emerges damaged in the eyes of Ohio voters,\u201d Ohio Democratic Party spokesperson Reeves Oyster said in a statement in response to LaRose\u2019s campaign launch. \u201cIn the days ahead, the people of Ohio should ask themselves: what is Frank LaRose really doing for us?\u201d LaRose enters the primary as the Republican most familiar to voters. He has won two statewide races, including re-election last year as secretary of state. A recent poll by East Carolina University showed him essentially tied in the teens with Dolan, who finished third in the Senate primary last year, with 58% of GOP voters undecided at this early stage. Moreno, a well-known former car dealer in the Cleveland area who dropped out of the 2022 contest months before the primary, was chosen by 7% of the poll\u2019s Republican respondents. But LaRose also enters the race as the most meagerly funded of the three. Unlike Moreno and Dolan, he lacks vast personal wealth to draw from and has spent recent months urging donors to support a nonprofit group his political allies started to keep him on competitive footing. Dolan, by contrast, has already begun airing TV ads. And Moreno is off to a strong fund-raising start. LaRose said in Monday\u2019s interview that in recent months, he has helped raise more than $1 million into an aligned super PAC that he has since departed because he is now a declared candidate and cannot coordinate with the group. \"I'm the only one in the race that isn't a millionaire,\" LaRose said. \"So I'm going to do this the old-fashioned way, the entrepreneurial way. ... We're going to have the resources to win this race, because nobody will outwork me.\" Trump endorsed LaRose's re-election bid for secretary of state last year \u2014 a fact that LaRose emphasizes. LaRose also said Monday that he has been in touch with Trump advisers and would welcome an endorsement. But he also said he has not decided whom to endorse in next year's Republican presidential primaries. At a private event this year, LaRose downplayed the sway Trump holds over GOP voters, according to audio leaked to Politico and NBC News. LaRose, unlike other Republican candidates for secretary of state last year, also has said he does not believe the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. More recently, LaRose put distance between himself and Trump after Trump was indicted over his handling of classified documents. A spokesperson at the time offered a statement that gently rebuked Trump \u2014 though not by name \u2014 and included criticism of how the Justice Department is handling the case. Moreno, on the other hand, attended Trump\u2019s defiant speech at his New Jersey golf club the evening after his arraignment. But LaRose also has made overtures to GOP activists who made false or exaggerated claims about voter fraud. His office launched a public integrity unit, and he appeared on a panel with election deniers during this year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. In the news release announcing his candidacy, LaRose dismissed Dolan and Moreno as insufficiently conservative. And in Monday's interview, LaRose boasted of a new agency within the secretary of state's office that will analyze election data \u2014 an effort he described as a Trump-friendly policy. The funding for agency, which LaRose pushed for, comes from the recently passed state budget, which Dolan, as chair of the Ohio Senate's Finance Committee, had a major role in passing. Chris Maloney, a Dolan strategist, noted that LaRose praised his soon-to-be rival after the budget was signed into law. \"Now, as a candidate for U.S. Senate, Frank is attacking him,\" Maloney said. \"It just reinforces the fact that on any given day, it's unclear which version of Frank LaRose is actually going to show up for work.\"",

        "content": "The deaths of four women whose bodies were found from February to May in and around Portland, Oregon, are linked, authorities said Monday. Investigators have identified \"at least\" one person of interest linked to the deaths of Kristin Smith, 22; Charity Perry, 24; Bridget Webster, 31; and Ashely Real, 22, the Multnomah County District Attorney\u2019s Office said in a statement. The person was not identified and no charges have been filed, and authorities declined to provide additional information about what connects the cases, citing ongoing death investigations. The prosecutor\u2019s office added that the cause and manner of death in each case remain under investigation by the state medical examiner\u2019s office. \"Based on the available information to investigators, there is not believed to be any active danger to the community at this time,\" the DA's statement said. Smith was found Feb. 19 in southeast Portland. Perry was discovered in a culvert on Multnomah County's East Historic Columbia River Highway on April 24. Webster was found six days later on a rural road in nearby Polk County, while Real was found in a wooded area in another nearby county, Clackamas, on May 7. In an interview last month, Webster's stepgrandfather said he'd changed her diapers, taught her to play basketball and raised her until she left home as a freshman in high school. \"She was a good girl until I lost contact with her years ago,\" he said. The release did not mention the cases of two other women found dead in the region during the same time frame. NBC affiliate KGW of Portland first reported the six deaths. The Portland Police Bureau said last month that authorities had found no evidence linking the deaths. The agency said that \"widely distributed social media posts and news media articles\" that suggested a connection between the deaths had caused fear and anxiety, \"and we want to provide reassurance that the speculation is not supported by the facts available at this point.\" In its release Monday, the prosecutor's office said nine law enforcement agencies throughout the region had worked \"collaboratively on numerous death investigations in Northwest Oregon\" to determine there were links among the four cases.",

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has said she plans to announce charging decisions stemming from an investigation into \"possible criminal interference in the administration of Georgia\u2019s 2020 general election\u201d during a Superior Court term that began Tuesday. Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney seated two grand juries that will hear cases over the length of term, which ends Sept. 1. Each panel consists of 23 jurors and three alternates. McBurney informed the grand jury members that they need only to find probable cause to indict a person and stressed that their decisions must be based on the law, not personal opinions. Willis has been conducting a sprawling investigation since early 2021 into whether Trump and his allies interfered in the state's election process during the last presidential election. She enlisted a special grand jury last year that was empowered to subpoena witnesses to assist in the probe, which looked at whether there were any \u201ccoordinated attempts to unlawfully alter the outcome of the 2020 elections.\u201d That panel recommended indicting more than a dozen people, its foreperson, Emily Kohrs, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News\u201d in February. The names have not been made public. \u201cThere are certainly names that you will recognize, yes. There are names also you might not recognize,\u201d Kohrs said at the time. Since then, a number of so-called fake electors \u2014 people who signed a certificate falsely declaring that Trump won Georgia in the 2020 election and that they were the state\u2019s official electors \u2014 have struck immunity deals with Willis\u2019 office, court filings show. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in the case and maintains Willis, a Democrat, is leading a politically motivated \"witch hunt\" against him. Willis has indicated that she could seek indictments in the case in the first half of August. \u201cI respectfully request that judges not schedule trials and in person hearings during the weeks beginning Monday, August 7 and Monday, August 14,\u201d Willis wrote in a letter in May to the chief judge of the Fulton County Courthouse. One of the grand juries impaneled Tuesday is scheduled to meet every Monday and Tuesday during the court's term, and the other is scheduled to convene Thursdays and Fridays. Both will hear cases two days a week. Unlike the special grand jury Willis used last year, the grand juries will hear all sorts of cases, not just those related to the election investigation. It takes 16 members to establish a quorum each day and 12 votes for an indictment. McBurney told the jurors they would be paid $25 a day for their service.

        "title": "Joe Manchin and Jon Huntsman flirt with third-party 2024 ticket in New Hampshire",
        "content": "MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 No Labels is taking another new, notable step advancing toward a potential third-party presidential bid in 2024, organizing a campaign-style event in New Hampshire on Monday featuring Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. The move comes as the Washington-based advocacy organization looks to recruit a Democrat and a Republican to form a bipartisan presidential ticket in 2024 \u2014 a prospect that could send an unpredictable jolt through the 2024 presidential race, which as of now is trending toward a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. No Labels\u2019 founder and CEO, Nancy Jacobson, told NBC News that No Labels is near its fundraising goal of $70 million, which will go toward its efforts to gain ballot access for its would-be presidential ticket in all 50 states. No Labels is scheduled to hold a convention next April in Dallas, where it\u2019ll formally nominate its presidential ticket.  Manchin continued to leave open the door to a third-party presidential run with No Labels, repeatedly declining to rule it out in an interview with NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019ll be next year,\u201d Manchin said about his timeline to decide what to do, meaning speculation about it (and his West Virginia Senate seat) will linger into 2024.  \u201cLet\u2019s see where everybody goes. Let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d said Manchin, an outspoken critic of partisanship in Washington. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll come to their senses and start doing the job they were elected to do.\u201d Many national Democrats fear that Manchin, who has often bucked his party and scaled back parts of his Democratic colleagues\u2019 legislative agenda in Congress, could siphon votes from Biden if he or another prominent Democrat were to join a third-party ticket next year.  One of the most striking differences between Biden\u2019s win in 2020 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump four years earlier was the low share of voters who decided to pick a third-party candidate in 2020. The third-party vote share fell from 6% in 2016 to 2% in 2020. And according to the NBC News exit poll, most of those who voted third-party in 2016 decided to back Biden four years later, helping deny Trump re-election. Now, Democrats worry that a growing third-party vote in 2024 would serve to lower the threshold Trump needs to win again \u2014 as in 2016, when 47% to 48% of the vote was enough for him to capture key swing states. Manchin dismissed Democratic fears that a No Labels-fueled presidential run would boost Trump. \u201cNobody at No Labels that I\u2019ve ever spoken to would ever be a spoiler,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cThere is no spoiling going [on] here to give an advantage to one side or the other. We\u2019re hoping both sides come to their sensible middle.\u201d \u201cWhen are people going to say enough\u2019s enough?\u201d Manchin said about partisan politics. \u201cWe hear it every day. \u2018Enough is enough. Can\u2019t you work together? What about us? What about this great country of ours?\u2019\u201d Manchin wasn\u2019t the only party-bucking politician on the trail Monday: Republican Jon Huntsman, the former U.S. ambassador to China and Utah governor, also joined Manchin in New Hampshire. Ahead of their trip, No Labels heralded the pair as the headliners of its \u201cCommon Sense Townhall\u201d Monday night at Saint Anselm College, a common waypoint for presidential contenders. The two spoke earlier at a diner in Manchester to a group of guests who received private invitations.  Huntsman, who sought the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, told NBC News he has \u201cno plans at this point\u201d to run on a third-party ticket in 2024. No Labels\u2019 leaders, including former Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat-turned-independent, and former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, continue to remain mum about possible candidates, though two sources familiar with the group\u2019s deliberations told NBC News that the ticket could include individuals who have not previously been elected to public office. Last week, businessman Mark Cuban told NBC News that he would not join the No Labels ticket but lauded the group\u2019s plans as \u201cvery important,\u201d adding: \u201cI like that they are trying a new path. I think the two-party system is broken.\u201d A NBC News poll in June showed that 44% of voters nationally said they would consider voting for an independent or third-party candidate for president in 2024.  And crucially, the poll found that Democratic-leaning voters are more open to the idea of backing such a candidate \u2014 illustrating why voices in the party have been so outspoken against No Labels\u2019 2024 plans.",

        "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 Georgia's Supreme Court on Monday denied Donald Trump's bid to halt the Fulton County district attorney's probe into whether the former president and his allies interfered in the state's 2020 presidential election. The rejected petition was one of two Trump\u2019s lawyers filed in different Georgia courthouses last week, both seeking to effectively derail District Attorney Fani Willis\u2019 investigation into whether there were \u201ccoordinated attempts to unlawfully alter the outcome of the 2020 elections.\u201d The petition sought to disqualify Willis from investigating Trump and to quash a report from the special grand jury she used to help her investigation. In a brief, unanimous ruling, the nine-judge state Supreme Court said what Trump was seeking \"is not the sort of relief that this Court affords, at least absent extraordinary circumstances that Petitioner has not shown are present here.\" \"Moreover, even if the petition were procedurally appropriate, Petitioner has not shown that he would be entitled to the relief he seeks,\" the court said. A representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The DA\u2019s office declined to comment. A similar Trump petition filed Friday is pending before Fulton County Superior Court. Both petitions sought a court order barring Willis \u201cfrom introducing any evidence obtained via the special purpose grand jury process to a regular grand jury.\u201d The special grand jury recommended indicting more than a dozen people, its foreperson, Emily Kohrs, said on \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d in February. Their names have not been made public. Trump's petition asked both courts to act swiftly because Willis \u201chas signaled that she will use the report \u2014 itself the fruit of contorted and coopted process \u2014 to secure an indictment against Petitioner within weeks, if not days.\u201d Trump filed a similar petition in Fulton County Superior Court in March. The judge who has overseen the grand jury investigation, Robert McBurney, has yet to rule on that filing. Willis began her sprawling investigation in January 2021. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and maintained that Willis, a Democrat, is conducting a politically motivated \"witch hunt.\" In letters to local law enforcement agencies, Willis has indicated that she would most likely seek indictments during the first half of August.

        "content": "A stranded sailor and his dog have been rescued in the South Pacific Ocean after months at sea, rescuers told Australian media over the weekend. The sailor, Tim Shaddock, 51, and Bella, the dog, departed from La Paz, Mexico, three months ago. A month into his journey, a storm struck his white catamaran, wiping out all electronics, according to 9News. Shaddock said he and Bella survived three months at sea eating raw fish and drinking rainwater. They were rescued by a Mexican tuna trawler over the weekend, 9News reported. \u201cI have been through a very difficult ordeal at sea,\u201d Shaddock told the channel, adding that he had fishing and other survival gear with him. \u201cI\u2019m just needing rest and good food because I\u2019ve been alone at sea a long time,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI have not had food, enough food, for a long time.\u201d A doctor who treated Shaddock on the trawler told 9News that he had \u201cnormal vital signs.\u201d Shaddock and Bella were spotted last week by a helicopter accompanying a tuna trawler, which was on its way back to Mexico, according to 9News. It was unclear when Shaddock first left Mexico and where he and Bella were rescued. The trawler was on its way back to the west coast of Mexico, where Shaddock would get further care, according to 9News. Shaddock said he avoided sunburn by sheltering under his boat\u2019s canopy, eating raw fish and drinking rainwater.  Mike Tipton, a physiology professor at the extreme environment laboratory at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom, said, \u201cIf you get sunburn, that affects your ability to regulate your body temperature.\u201d He said Shaddock could otherwise sweat up to 1 or 2 liters an hour. \u201cIf you do absolutely nothing and you rest and you stay cool, you can get away with as less as 110 to 220 milliliters of water a day,\u201d he said. Shaddock had to look after not only himself, but also his dog, which Tipton said, helped them survive. \u201cHe had companionship. Once you\u2019ve got enough food and water, then I think the dog has an advantage,\u201d Tipton said. \"Your survival time is as long as you can keep collecting water, getting occasional food and doing things that help you stay positive.\u201d Finding Shaddock was like finding a \"needle in a haystack\" in the enormous Pacific Ocean, Tipton said, especially because the helicopter was not even actively looking for him. \"It was a combination of luck and the right behavior,\" he said.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday reiterated criticisms of Sen. Tommy Tuberville's blockade of hundreds of military nominations and again called on congressional Republicans to speak up. \"A cascading effect of delayed promotions threatens to brain-drain from the military,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"And military families do not know where they will live, where spouses will work, where children will go to school.\" Jean-Pierre also referred to previous statements Tuberville, R-Ala., has made about supporting the military, saying, \"Sen. Tuberville from 2021 and 2022 should intervene with 2023 Sen. Tuberville, because clearly there's a problem here.\" Tuberville has halted the normally routine process for military promotions in Congress as part of his objection to a Defense Department policy supporting service members and dependents seeking abortions. He said last week that he would consider lifting his holds if the abortion policy were put to a vote in Congress and if the White House and the Pentagon agreed that the policy would be removed if the vote were to fail. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Monday that not having the Pentagon's abortion policy would have an \"extremely, extremely significant impact\" on military recruiting and retention. \"What happens if you get assigned to a state like Alabama, which has a pretty restrictive abortion law in place, and you're concerned about your reproductive care? What do you do?\" Kirby asked. \"Do you say no and get out? Well, some people may decide to do that, and what does that mean? That means we lose talent, important talent.\" Kirby said the military's policies, including those supporting transgender and female service members, are a \"foundational, sacred obligation of military leaders.\" \"It matters because it says we're invested in you because you are being willing to invest in us,\" Kirby said. \"You're investing your life, your family's livelihood with us. We owe you that back in return.\" In response to NBC News' request for comment, a Tuberville spokesman said that what is really affecting recruiting is \"the Biden administration's politicizing the military.\" \u201cThe Biden administration seems a lot more concerned about 260 generals and admirals than about tens of thousands of missing recruits,\u201d the spokesman said. In April, military officials told the House Armed Services Committee that the Army, the Navy and the Air Force would not meet enlistment goals this year. Several Senate Republicans have been critical of Tuberville's hold on nominations. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has expressed concern over putting holds on military promotions as opposed to political nominees, while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said he does not support \"putting a hold on military nominations.\" NBC News reported Thursday that the White House is putting increased pressure on Republicans over Tuberville's blockade, according to a new memo. \u201cRight now, a Republican Senator is choosing to erode military readiness and abuse military families in the pursuit of an unrelated and extreme anti-freedom agenda \u2014 with barely a sound from his GOP colleagues,\u201d White House communications adviser Andrew Bates wrote in the memo.",

        "title": "North Carolina elections at risk of chaos with Legislature's proposed overhaul",
        "content": "North Carolina lawmakers are considering not only a spate of new election restrictions but also a major overhaul of state and county-level election boards, alarming advocates who say some of the proposals could grind the state\u2019s democratic apparatus to a halt. The changes would restrict same-day registration and mail-in voting. They would also give new powers to the state Legislature, where Republican lawmakers have been emboldened by a new veto-proof majority, along with a new Republican majority on the state Supreme Court. The three bills, which could be considered in House committee hearings as early as this week, come as North Carolina begins to institute new voter ID rules. The state Supreme Court had previously declared the photo ID requirements unconstitutional, but the new Republican majority reversed that decision earlier this year, allowing the law to be enacted. Critics, including voting rights advocates and Democrats, said that provisions in the bills would threaten the democratic process and suppress voting. The Republican sponsors of the bills did not respond to requests for comment or declined to speak. \u201cIt\u2019s undermining democracy, period. Plain and simple,\u201d Democratic state Rep. Allison Dahle, vice chair of the House committee that will soon consider the Senate bills, told NBC News. Christopher Cooper, a professor and director of the Public Policy Institute at Western Carolina University, said the new election bills would add more uncertainty to a system that's already facing big changes. \"There's so much up in the air about what the Board of Elections is going to look like, how voter ID is going to be implemented, when our mail-in ballots are going to be allowed to be accepted,\" he said. \"Anybody who says they can tell you what North Carolina elections are gonna look like in 2024 is lying.\" Senate Bill 749 would overhaul state and local election boards, the five-person bodies that oversee democratic operations and certify election results. County election boards in North Carolina are tasked with running elections \u2014 registering voters, operating polling sites and counting ballots \u2014 while the state board appoints individuals to the county boards and oversees their work, while also handling campaign finance disclosures and compliance with the law. Currently, the state and county boards include three members of the governor's party and two members of the other party. Nominations are made by the parties, while appointments are made by the governor. The bill, which passed the Senate in June, would strip the governor of a role in the process. Instead, it would create an eight-person State Board of Elections, divided evenly between the two parties and appointed by party leaders in the state Legislature. County boards would be cut to four members \u2014 also evenly split along party lines and appointed by lawmakers. The new boards are designed to restore trust in elections by eliminating partisan advantage, advocates of the bill say, but experts warn that they could lead to a nightmare scenario: deadlocked boards tasked with completing the most critical tasks in election administration. The bill identifies a few scenarios in which the Legislature could step in to resolve an impasse \u2014 such as appointing a chairman of the election board \u2014 but offers no alternatives for deadlocks on key tasks like certifying election results. Throwing it to the Legislature would also, for now, benefit Republicans, who have a majority in both chambers \u2014 something they're likely to preserve thanks to aggressive and effective gerrymandering throughout the state. Meanwhile, the current Democratic governor would be cut out of the process in making appointments \u2014 and thereby controlling the balance of power on the boards. \u201cHow do they get anything done? Are the important decisions going to be deadlocked? The consequences of that, as we are learning, could be devastating,\u201d said Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause North Carolina. Early voting polling sites and schedules must be approved by the unanimous support of a county election board under current law, Phillips said. If a member of the county board objects, the state board must decide. If it cannot, he said, current law says the only early voting site would be the county board of elections office. Such a decision could have a devastating impact on turnout in large counties that might normally have more than a dozen early voting locations, he said, and leave voters in more rural, less populous counties forced to travel. This is at least the fourth time state Republicans have tried to secure power over the State Board of Elections in North Carolina since Democrat Roy Cooper won the governor\u2019s mansion in 2016. Two attempts to rework the election board were declared unconstitutional, while a third attempt \u2014 a constitutional amendment in 2018 \u2014 failed at the ballot box. John Hood, a member of the board of the conservative John Locke Foundation, said he believes this latest bill is also unconstitutional. \u201cThey assume that the North Carolina Supreme Court wouldn\u2019t rule the same way that previous courts have ruled in this question, but I don\u2019t think they should make that assumption,\u201d he told NBC News. At a press conference announcing SB 747 and SB 749, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger, a Republican whose district includes Rockingham and parts of Guilford, said he believed the previous decisions on election boards by the state Supreme Court might have been wrongly decided, pointing to the dissents on past rulings. The 2018 dissents were written by Republicans judges, who recently won the majority of the court. The majority leader\u2019s son Phil Berger Jr. is one of the Republican judges on the court. House Bill 772 allows poll watchers to \u201cmove freely\u201d around polling sites \u2014 standing as close as 5 feet away from voters and poll workers \u2014 and listen and record many activities inside the polling site. The bill writes a number of new powers for poll watchers into law: They can listen to conversations at the polling site, including those that identify voters and their addresses. They can take videos or photos of tabulation equipment at the start and finish of voting, and use their cell phones for note taking and communication, as long as they don\u2019t take calls inside the voting enclosure during voting hours. Senate Bill 747, which also passed the Senate last month, adds a spate of new restrictions to voting, including provisions that: Democrats say the bill includes provisions that would suppress voting, while others are ill-conceived proposals designed to appease base voters who believe former President Donald Trump\u2019s stolen election lie. For example, two-factor authentication is \u201cnonsensical,\u201d said state Sen. Natasha Marcus, a Democrat who opposed the legislation. \u201cWe literally asked them over and over: What does that even mean? That doesn\u2019t make any sense, you should take that out of this bill,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t explain it, but they wouldn\u2019t take it out either.\u201d",

        "title": "Russia halts wartime deal allowing Ukraine to ship grain",
        "content": "LONDON \u2014 Russia halted an unprecedented wartime deal Monday that allows grain to flow from Ukraine to countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where hunger is a growing threat and high food prices have pushed more people into poverty. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced Russia would suspend the Black Sea Grain Initiative until its demands to get its own agricultural shipments to the world are met \u2014 even though the country has been shipping record amounts of wheat and its fertilizers also have been flowing. \u201cWhen the part of the Black Sea deal related to Russia is implemented, Russia will immediately return to the implementation of the deal,\u201d he said. Russia has complained that restrictions on shipping and insurance have hampered its exports of food and fertilizer \u2014 also critical to the global food chain. The suspension marks the end of an accord that the United Nations and Turkey brokered last summer to allow food to leave the Black Sea region after Russia\u2019s invasion of its neighbor worsened a global food crisis. The initiative is credited with helping lower soaring prices of wheat, vegetable oil and other food commodities. Ukraine and Russia are both major global suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other affordable food products on which developing nations rely. The grain deal provided assurances that ships won\u2019t be attacked entering and leaving Ukrainian ports, while a separate agreement facilitated the movement of Russian food and fertilizer. While Western sanctions do not apply to Moscow\u2019s agricultural shipments, some companies may be wary of doing business with Russia because of the measures. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said the suspension was expected and believes it\u2019s political theater. \u201cThe statement itself immediately includes an escape clause,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, we are dealing with classic public techniques of the Russian Federation that no longer require significant reciprocal reactions.\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said the country\u2019s foreign minister would speak with his Russian counterpart Monday \u2014 and that he was hopeful the deal would be extended. The suspension of the deal sent wheat prices up about 3% in Chicago trading, to $6.81 a bushel. Analysts don\u2019t expect more than a temporary bump to food commodity prices because countries such as Russia and Brazil have ratcheted up wheat and corn exports, but food insecurity worldwide is growing. The Black Sea Grain Initiative has allowed three Ukrainian ports to export 32.9 million metric tons of grain and other food to the world, more than half of that to developing nations, according to the joint coordination center in Istanbul. The agreement was renewed for 60 days in May, but in recent months, the amount of food shipped and the number of vessels departing Ukraine have plunged, with Russia accused of preventing additional ships from participating. The war in Ukraine sent food commodity prices to record highs last year and contributed to a global food crisis also tied to other conflicts, the lingering effects of the Covid pandemic, droughts and other climate factors. High costs of grain needed for food staples in countries such as Egypt, Lebanon and Nigeria exacerbated economic challenges and helped push millions more into poverty or food insecurity. Rising food prices affect people in developing countries disproportionately, because they spend more of their money on meals. Under the deal, prices of global food commodities such as wheat and vegetable oil have fallen, but food was already expensive before the war in Ukraine and the relief hasn\u2019t trickled down to kitchen tables. \u201cThe Black Sea deal is absolutely critical for the food security of a number of countries,\u201d and its loss will compound the problems for those facing high debt levels and climate fallout, said Simon Evenett, a professor of international trade and economic development at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said this month that 45 countries need outside food assistance, with high local food prices \u201ca driver of worrying levels of hunger\u201d in those places.",

        "content": "A Nicaraguan migrant who died in immigration custody last week had been recommended for release by an ICE panel last year but remained detained until his death, advocates said Thursday. Ernesto Rocha-Cuadra, 42, died Friday at a hospital in Jena, Louisiana, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement this week. The preliminary cause of death \u201cwas reported by hospital medical officials to be cardiac arrest,\u201d it said. An ICE panel recommended that Rocha-Cuadra be released in November, a coalition of immigration advocacy groups said in a statement Thursday. The statement said officials at the detention center declined to release him.  \u201cThey kept telling him he was going to be released soon,\u201d Frank Rocha-Cuadra, who is Ernesto\u2019s brother and a U.S. citizen, said in the statement from the Shut Down NOLA ICE Coalition. \u201cHe was guaranteed he was coming home. Our message is, we want to know what happened to our Ernesto and we will not stop until we find out.\u201d The coalition said that according to Rocha-Cuadra\u2019s attorneys, he had been petitioning for his freedom and was scheduled for an immigration hearing July 9.  \u201cErnesto\u2019s untimely death raises many questions that should be investigated at the highest levels. This immigrant prison must be shut down,\u201d Rose Murray, a senior direct services attorney with the Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in the statement. The statement said that while the details of Rocha-Cuadra\u2019s death were still unclear, his attorneys say that he never mentioned having heart-related medical issues and that his medical records did not indicate heart-related medical issues, either. ICE did not immediately respond to request for comment on Rocha-Cuadra\u2019s case and whether he had been recommended for release.  Immigration authorities apprehended Rocha-Cuadra after he crossed the border near Andrade, California, on April 17, 2022, according to ICE. On April 26, 2022, he was transferred to ICE custody as he waited for his immigration case to play out. \u201cICE incarcerated Ernesto for over a year during which he suffered extensive time in solitary confinement,\u201d the immigration advocacy groups\u2019 statement said. Rocha-Cuadra\u2019s immigration counsel, Homero L\u00f3pez, the legal director of the group Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy, said, \u201cHis tragic death after being caged by ICE for more than a year is a reminder of how useless and unnecessary the immigration detention system truly is.\u201d The immigration groups said Rocha-Cuadra was the fifth person to have died in ICE custody at the Jena detention center since 2016 and the 11th during the Biden administration. ICE said in its statement this week that it notified the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General, the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility and the Nicaraguan Consulate General in Miami of Rocha-Cuadra\u2019s death.",

Police and firefighters in Antioch \u2014 a village just south of the Wisconsin border about halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee \u2014 rushed to the Antioch Taste of Summer festival at about 2:40 p.m. Sunday, authorities said. The first responders \"discovered an injured 10-year-old child who appeared to have been thrown from a carnival ride,\" police said in a statement Sunday. The boy was on ride called Moby Dick, which locks people in at the shoulders and then goes up and down as speed increases. Village officials identified the boy Monday as Huntley Daniels. He was first taken to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, but because of the extent of his injuries, he was then airlifted to Comer Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago, the village said in a statement. He \"suffered multiple facial and jaw fractures and a significant injury to the bones in one leg,\" the statement said. The youngster was set to undergo surgery Monday, Antioch Fire Chief Jon Cokefair told NBC News. \"He has some pretty significant injuries,\" said Cokefair, who estimated the boy's fall to have been 15 to 20 feet. Witness Elliott Johnson told NBC Chicago: \"I saw maybe on the third time around, he almost did a, like, a dive, like his hands were down and his legs were straight off the ride, and [he] landed\" on the pavement.\" Johnson said he also went on the Moby Dick ride and had problems with its safety bar. \"My bar was coming up over my head, so I was trying, every time I went up ... I was almost about to fall out. I would slam [the bar] down to close it,\" he said. Parent Lauren Tardi said she spotted workers not always making sure the safety bars were securely fastened. \"I was concerned, because I could see that when they pulled it down that a couple of kids, a few times, could still put it back up,\" she said. Mayor Scott Gartner consulted with law enforcement, fire and other village officials before he invoked \"his executive authority to order the remainder of the rides\" at the event to be shut down Sunday, police said. Police, fire and state Labor Department investigators are leading the probe. \u201cWe will be working with the Lake County States Attorney to determine if any criminal charges will be appropriate under these circumstances,\u201d Antioch Police Chief Geoffrey Guttschow said in a statement Monday. The ride's equipment and labor were provided by All American Amusement, based in Lockport, Illinois, in a contract with the village's Chamber of Commerce, Antioch officials said. To ride Moby Dick, a passenger must be at least 42 inches tall, according to All American Amusement's website. All American lists the ride's maker as Wisdom Rides of America, with Moby Dick being one version of its Genesis Ride line. Representatives for All American and Wisdom Rides could not immediately be reached for comment Monday.",

        "content": "A mountain biker died Saturday after helping to get emergency crews to a group of hikers who were suffering dehydration in San Diego County. A group of cyclists in Jacumba found four hikers who had no food or water and were experiencing heat exhaustion, Cal Fire Capt. Brent Pascua told NBC San Diego. Two of the cyclists went to the trailhead to meet with emergency crews and give them GPS coordinates to the hikers. \"Once the four hikers were lifted to safety, they required no further treatment,\" Pascua said. \"That's when the last two mountain bikers rode back to the trailhead to meet up with everyone. And somewhere in between there, the last two got separated.\" Emergency crews found one cyclist, who was not identified, about a quarter-mile from the trailhead. The person, who was unresponsive, was carried back to an air-conditioned pickup truck, Pascua said. The cyclist was driven over to where the ambulances were set up on the trail. \"That's where they worked on the patient, tried to provide lifesaving measures, and ultimately the patient was pronounced at 5:45 p.m.,\" Pascua said. Cal Fire's San Diego County division posted Saturday afternoon on Facebook that it was responding to a \"remote area rescue in the area of Carrizo Gorge\" after it received reports that four people were suffering dehydration. The post said six people were treated and released, in addition to two bystanders who were assessed but needed no aid. The San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department closed some trails Saturday because of the extreme heat. The sheriff's department did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the dead cyclist.  Pascua said Cal Fire crews reported temperatures reached nearly 110 degrees Saturday. AccuWeather had the high in Jacumba at 106 degrees, while Weather.com reported the highest temperature in the area Saturday at 103 degrees. Pascua encouraged people to change their plans for outdoor activities when temperatures reach extremes or to at least pack more water than they believe they will need. \"It\u2019s unfortunate this was a good Samaritan just trying to help out. ... Unfortunately, bad things happen to people out there when it\u2019s this hot,\" Pascua said. \"Know your limitations and try and get help as soon as possible. That way we can get out there and help you.\"",

        "title": "Vivek Ramaswamy releases conservative pool of Supreme Court picks",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Borrowing a tactic from former President Donald Trump, 2024 GOP Oval Office hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of conservative potential Supreme Court nominees Monday. The roster includes two senators \u2014 Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R-Utah \u2014 former Solicitor General Paul Clement and a half-dozen of the nation's most conservative federal appellate court judges. Some of them have worked to limit abortion and transgender rights. Ramaswamy also named seven judges, from various federal district courts, the U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, as a pool from which he would select U.S. circuit court nominees if he is elected. \"We were looking for diversity of vantage points on the Constitution, but without a diversity of commitment to the originalist understanding of the Constitution,\" Ramaswamy said in an interview with NBC News. In May 2016, as Trump locked down the Republican nomination, he thrilled conservatives by announcing his own list of 11 people whom he might name to succeed Antonin Scalia. None of them were Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump actually nominated and who now sits on the high court. Ramaswamy said he may add to his pool later. But for now, it consists of Cruz, Lee, Clement and these six judges: James Ho, Lawrence VanDyke, Lisa Branch, Thomas Hardiman, Justin Walker and John Bush. Ho and Branch have said they won't hire law clerks from Yale and Stanford as retaliation for what they describe as the \"cancel culture\" at those universities. Ramaswamy, a businessman and author, holds a law degree from Yale. A gifted public speaker who rails against \"woke\" Democrats, Ramaswamy has generated modest buzz within Republican circles but typically polls in the low single digits in national surveys of the GOP field. Few issues are as important to Republican primary voters as the composition of the court, and candidates often try to reassure those voters that they will pick conservatives justices. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running second in national polls, recently said the three justices Trump put on the Supreme Court don't meet the \"gold standard.\" \"We'll do better than that,\" DeSantis told radio host Hugh Hewitt. Ramaswamy, whose list includes several Trump appointees, said the former president's nominees have been \"outstanding\" at the Supreme Court and lower federal benches. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a misplaced criticism,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cIt borders on bizarre.\u201d He said his decision to release lists of judges was not originally driven by Trump's use of the maneuver during the 2016 and 2020 campaigns. But by the time he put out his own list Monday, he was well aware that Trump had made similar moves. Ramaswamy's pool for seats on the U.S. circuit courts is also comprised of conservative stalwarts: U.S. district court judges Martha Pacold, Sarah Pitlyk, Kathryn Mizelle, Matthew Kacsmaryk and Brantley Starr, as well as Stephen Alexander Vaden of the U.S. Court of International Trade and Ryan Holte of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",

        "content": "Ukrainian naval drones hit a key bridge linking Russia to the annexed Crimean Peninsula, killing a couple and seriously injuring their daughter, the Kremlin said Monday. The bridge, a symbolic and strategically important piece of infrastructure that President Vladimir Putin himself opened in 2018, connects road and rail traffic from Russia to the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014. Pictures from The Associated Press and others showed that part of the roadbed had fallen away, with warped metal girders hanging down toward the water. Russian officials said the bridge was hit by blasts from two Ukrainian \u201cunmanned naval surface vehicles,\u201d the National Antiterrorism Committee said in a statement, adding that it had opened an investigation into what it called a \"terrorist act.\" A man and a woman driving along the bridge were killed and their daughter was seriously injured, it said. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said at a daily briefing that Russia knew \"the reasons\" behind \"this terrorist act\" but did not elaborate further. Both he and the country's foreign ministry made suggestions about Western involvement in the incident, a common talking point in Moscow, without providing evidence. \"If the Western origin of the naval surface drones that attacked the bridge \u2014 as well as the role of Western countries in planning, sponsoring and carrying out this operation \u2014 is revealed, this will confirm their complicity in the terrorist activities of the Kyiv regime,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement. Putin is set to hold a televised meeting about the bridge on Monday evening. Russian officials did not provide evidence of their claims of responsibility. Hours after the attack, Russia halted an unprecedented wartime deal allowing grain to flow from Ukraine to countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Ukraine's public broadcaster, Suspilne, cited multiple anonymous law enforcement sources as saying the bridge explosion was the result of a special operation by Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency and its navy. NBC News has not confirmed the reports. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence spokesperson, Andriy Yusov, declined to comment on whether Ukraine was involved. Speaking with Suspilne, he noted only that \"any logistical problems are additional complications for the occupiers\" \u2014 meaning Russia. Earlier, Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s southern command, suggested Russia could be behind the attack. \"Given the unprecedented security measures that the Russians have been taking for a long time around the Crimean bridge, they most likely controlled this entire situation and it continues to unfold according to the script programmed by them,\" she told Suspilne. In October, Russia blamed Ukraine for another explosion that damaged the bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge. Ukraine admitted only indirectly to the attack months later. Monday's explosions happened at 3:04 a.m. (8:04 p.m. ET Sunday) and 3:20 a.m., according to the Grey Zone, a channel on the messaging app Telegram affiliated with Russia's Wagner mercenary group, according to Reuters. Vladimir Konstantinov, the speaker of the Russia-installed Crimean parliament, said in a statement posted on Telegram that the railroad section of the bridge, which is crucial for Russian military logistics, had not been damaged in the blasts. \"Kyiv could not help but know that the automobile part of the crossing is a purely civilian facility,\" he said. \"But that has never stopped the terrorists. It won\u2019t stop [them] in the future.\" He added that \"regarding the retribution,\" the Russian Defense Ministry \"has promised strikes against the centers where the criminal decisions are made,\" he said. The incident also fired up some of the Kremlin's most hawkish propagandists. Margarita Simonyan, the head of the Russian state broadcaster RT, suggested that if \"British intelligence\" was behind the attack \u2014 something for which she did not provide evidence \u2014 then London's Tower Bridge would \"absolutely\" be a legitimate target. And Vladimir Solovyov, one of the most prolific and outspoken pro-Kremlin voices on Russian state TV, suggested his country should hit back by bombing Ukraine's parliament building and turning the office of its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, into a \"crater.\"",

        "content": "Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz basked Monday in the glow of thrilling victory over the weekend \u2014 but he conceded that he could have easily lost the title match in straight sets. Alcaraz topped Novak Djokovic in five sets Sunday to win the world's most famous tennis tournament in a match he said could have easily gone the other way. Speaking on NBC's \"TODAY\" show, Alcaraz said he was \"really, really glad\" to have won the second set. \u201cIf not, probably I could have lost, you know, in the straight sets,\u201d he said. \u201cI just believe in myself all of the time.\u201d Djokovic dominated the first set before Alcaraz won a thrilling tiebreaker to win the second and set the stage for an epic five-set showdown that lasted almost five hours. Alcaraz said that even as Djokovic dominated the early play, he talked himself into remaining upbeat, knowing his chances to win games and get back into the match would come. Alcaraz, 20, couldn\u2019t be blamed for a momentary case of stage fright, playing on the sport\u2019s most sacred ground, Centre Court of the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club. \"It was a dream come true for me\" just to play for the championship, Alcaraz said. \"It was tough to deal with the nerves facing Novak on that stage.\" The audience Sunday included Kate, Princess of Wales; Prince William; their two oldest children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte; and King Felipe VI of Spain.  Alcaraz said he caught a glimpse of Felipe shouting an encouraging \"vamos\" after he won points. \"I was not thinking about it. I tried not to think about it,\" he said. \"But sometimes it's difficult to stay away from that. It's your own Spanish king watching you, supporting you.\u201d Alcaraz became the youngest men's champ since 17-year-old Boris Becker won it in 1985. Djokovic, 36, has won seven men's singles titles and is still one short of the record eight championships of the recently retired Roger Federer. Both Alcaraz and Djokovic are expected to play in the U.S. Open this year.",

        "title": "In \u2018warfare against renters,\u2019 homeowners fight affordable housing push",
        "content": "At a packed City Hall meeting, one resident after another stood before the City Council of the suburban Phoenix city of Surprise pleading with officials to block the construction of an apartment complex for seniors and lower-income renters \u2014 shouting, heckling and arguing about crime and traffic congestion.   In the crowd was Nate Pomeroy, a leader in the effort to block the apartment complex. He moved to Surprise in 2018 from Scottsdale after years in California to retire and expected it would be the last home he\u2019d live in. Now, he\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll stay. He worries the apartment complex will increase traffic and change the character of the area, which is made up of sprawling subdivisions of Spanish-style homes selling for $500,000 to $700,000.   The heated debate in Surprise, population 150,000, is being echoed in large and small communities across the country as local officials have pushed to increase the housing supply with small backyard bungalows to subsidized apartment complexes in response to surging rents and home prices since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.   \u201cIt\u2019s just going to turn this into a very high-density area. It\u2019s going to really change the look and feel of where we are, and people aren\u2019t happy about it,\u201d Pomeroy said. \u201cThe City Council and city management have not listened effectively. They\u2019re going to build and build and build, and it\u2019s no longer going to be the last place I live.\u201d Vocal groups of homeowners say they are fearful of what the changes could mean for their communities. Increasingly, they are fighting back with lawsuits, referendums, appeals to state representatives and recall elections in a battle to stave off multifamily housing in their largely suburban neighborhoods. \u201cIt\u2019s the same buzzwords no matter where you are. Some are more veiled than others as far as whether they will flat-out say that renters are second-class citizens,\u201d said Owen Metz, a senior vice president at Dominium, an affordable housing developer that is working on the proposed apartment complex in Surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s not everywhere, but there seems to be this growing warfare against renters.\u201d Homeowners have long put up fights against new developments \u2014 the acronym NIMBY, or \"not in my backyard,\" has been in use for decades \u2014 but the battles have grown louder in recent years amid a wave of apartment construction stretching outside of city centers. The debates have also taken on new urgency as surging home prices drive out middle-class workers and lead to an uptick in homelessness, affordable housing advocates said.  For the past 15 years, the rate at which new homes and apartments are being built has failed to keep up with the demand, in part because of the lingering effects of the 2008 housing market crash, said Jeff Tucker, a senior economist at Zillow, which estimates the U.S. has a shortage of more than 4 million homes. Awais Azhar, a housing advocate in Austin, Texas, who is a member of the city\u2019s Planning Commission, said: \u201cThat cost pressure that was being felt by coastal cities has now traveled to our suburbs. It\u2019s traveled to our rural areas. Affordability is truly a United States crisis. There is a lot of pressure and angst from local advocates and leaders, because while unaffordability has been an issue for a while, we\u2019ve just never seen this level of crisis in the way we\u2019re seeing it now.\u201d The housing shortage was aggravated during the pandemic when remote work and the desire for more space led to a population shift toward less densely packed suburban areas and relatively lower-cost states, like Texas, Arizona and Colorado. In turn, home prices have risen more than 30% and rents are up more than 25% nationwide since 2020. The Phoenix area has experienced some of the biggest housing cost increases in the country, with rents up 41% since the start of 2020 and home prices up more than 50%, according to Zillow. At the same time, homelessness in the region has increased 36%. In Surprise, an outer-lying suburb of Phoenix backed up against the desert, residents have been fighting the city and the developer for more than a year, first with an attempt to get the project on the election ballot and then in court. At the center of the fight are 388 apartments for people with incomes up to $39,300 for individuals and $56,100 for families of four with rents that would range from $1,052 for one bedroom to $1,458 for three bedrooms. The proposed development, on what was once a ranch, would also include 211 units of housing for seniors.  City officials supporting the development said it could help provide housing to workers essential to the community, like teachers making an average salary of $42,000. The project would be financed by a federal low-income housing tax credit that would offset some of the costs and enable the developer to offer below-market rents. Unlike government-owned and -operated public housing projects built for lower-income residents decades ago, the vast majority of affordable housing built today is owned and managed by private developers using the tax credit.  Pomeroy said he understands the need for more affordable housing in Surprise and knows more development is inevitable in his neighborhood. But he doesn\u2019t believe the project fits with the \u201clook and feel\u201d of the area and questions whether there is the road and water infrastructure to handle that many new residents. \u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily against affordable housing. We get this is politically very unpopular, because as soon as you talk about that the liberal locals, the media, etc., will label us as NIMBYs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo now all of a sudden we\u2019re back on our heels going \u2018Wait a minute, we\u2019re not bad people,\u2019 and then they just shout you down and all that garbage.\u201d Homeowners are mounting opposition not just to housing that would provide below-market rents but to any attempt by city officials and developers to increase housing supply by building multifamily projects, whether they are large apartment complexes or smaller duplexes, in areas now dominated by single-family homes. In Austin, residents sued to block the city from updating its land code to allow for more apartment buildings and multifamily projects \u2014 significantly slowing down a much-needed increase to the city's housing supply, Azhar said. Average rents in the Austin area have increased 28% and the sale price of a home has increased nearly 50% since the start of 2020, according to data from Zillow.  In Colorado, an effort by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis to spur creation of more multifamily housing units statewide failed this year, and residents have continued to push back at the local level. In the Denver suburb of Englewood, residents are seeking to recall the mayor and several City Council members over their support for more multifamily housing, including changes that would allow people to build smaller homes on their properties called accessory dwelling units, said Kurt Suppes, who is organizing the recall. \u201cAll these people that bought these homes all these years ago are now suddenly facing huge changes in their neighborhoods and the potential loss of a whole lot of the equity that they have in their homes,\u201d said Suppes, who has lived in his home in Englewood for 40 years. \u201cNobody is going to want to buy your house except the developers.\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul recently backed off a statewide strategy to build 800,000 homes over the next decade that would have included increasing development in New York City\u2019s suburbs after swift bipartisan opposition from members of the state Legislature.  The debate has also been playing out in Washington. President Joe Biden has urged the construction of more affordable housing, having released a plan last year to provide incentives for states and cities to build hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units over the next three years. That\u2019s in contrast with former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly warned while he was in office that Democrats would destroy the suburbs with low-income housing that would bring crime and reduce home values. The resistance from homeowners and elected officials has caused developers to abandon projects and slowed construction, in some cases adding a year or more to projects\u2019 timelines, said Dan Klocke, a project development manager with the affordable housing builder Gorman & Co. It has also caused developers to avoid undertaking projects in some cities that have mounted past opposition, he said.  \u201cThe risks are high. All of that added time for not just one project but for hundreds of projects slows down the amount of housing that you build over time in your state,\u201d Klocke said. \"When you continue to do that in project after project, you build far fewer housing units, and it\u2019s basic supply and demand. The less supply, the higher the demand, the higher the price. Then, there goes your affordability.\u201d While residents have so far been unable to stop the development in Surprise, opposition from residents and a lack of support from city officials in nearby Buckeye contributed to the same developer\u2019s decision to cancel plans to build 300 subsidized apartment units in the city, Metz said.  Local officials said they saw an unprecedented level of opposition from residents, who raised fears about crime to water shortages. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have gotten more complaints about a specific project than that project. Our inboxes were just full,\u201d Mayor Eric Orsborn said. Like Surprise, Buckeye sits at the edge of the desert in the outer ring of metropolitan Phoenix, and its population has ballooned, too. In 2000, it had just 6,500 residents, half of them inmates at the local prison, and it now has a population of more than 100,000, Orsborn said.  But more large-scale housing projects are inevitable for the community given the pace of growth, and they are something residents are going to have to learn to accept, Buckeye City Council member Clay Goodman said.  \u201cYou can\u2019t shut the door after you get here,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of growth that\u2019s coming, and as a council, we\u2019re trying to do it the right way.\u201d",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The now-husband of a Jan. 6 defendant who was identified by her ex after the FBI posted viral images of her wearing a pink beret during the Capitol attack has also been charged with federal crimes. Spencer Geller, the husband of \"Pink Beret,\" now identified by the FBI as Jennifer Inzunza Vargas Geller, faces a felony count of obstructing, impeding or interfering with officers during civil disorder, along with misdemeanor charges. The couple were in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021, and split up once they got to the Capitol. Vargas Geller ended up inside, while Geller, her husband, remained outside and was at the location of some of the most violent scenes of the day. As NBC News first reported, \"Pink Beret\" has long been a subject of interest to online \"Sedition Hunters\" who have aided in hundreds of Jan. 6 cases and who have identified hundreds of additional Capitol rioters who have not been arrested. But it was not until the FBI tweeted images of \"Pink Beret\" in April that her photos went viral and were seen by an ex, who was standing in line at a Joann Fabric and Crafts store when his buddy showed him the FBI tweet on his phone. \u201cI stopped dead in my tracks,\u201d the ex said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s Jenny.\u2019\u201d The ex reported Vargas Geller to the FBI, and she was charged with several misdemeanors on May 8. But she was not arrested because she was out of the country. The FBI affidavit in her husband's case indicates that a tipster believed the couple were traveling in Japan, and online sleuths have surfaced numerous photos and videos of the couple, who appear to be living in Asia with a baby. On Jan. 6, Geller \u201cwas one of the first individuals to arrive at the West Plaza,\" the FBI affidavit says, and he can be seen on video \"pushing bike racks\" during the initial breach of the barricade around the Capitol. He eventually made his way up to the entrance to the lower west tunnel, where some of the most violent scenes took place, according to the FBI affidavit. The FBI first posted images of \"Pink Beret\" after a defense lawyer for another Jan. 6 defendant suggested that the woman was a \"femme fatale\" government operative who lured defendants into the Capitol. No lawyer was listed for Geller who could be asked to comment.",

Israel also characterized the conversation as \u201cwarm and long.\u201d John Kirby, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said Biden underscored his \"ironclad\" commitment to Israel's security. In addition to discussing Iran, the two leaders also talked about judicial reforms in Israel and Biden's concern about settlement growth, Kirby said at a White House briefing. He added that they would meet in the fall. In a summary of the call, the White House said that Biden \"expressed concern about continued settlement growth and called on all parties to refrain from further unilateral measures\" and that he reiterated \"the need for the broadest possible consensus\" in the debate in Israel over judicial reforms. \"As friends can and friends should, you speak honestly, openly, forthrightly, candidly. You lay it out there, and President Biden has done that,\" Kirby said. \"He's done it publicly with respect to judicial reforms, and he'll continue to do it in his conversations with Israeli leaders.\" Kirby said the two leaders had been trying to schedule the call for \"some weeks.\" Biden and Netanyahu last spoke in March. Netanyahu was rushed to the hospital over the weekend after he experienced \u201cmild dizziness,\u201d his office said. The director of the hospital\u2019s cardiology unit said the hospitalization was due to dehydration. Netanyahu was discharged Sunday after he was fitted with a heart monitor. U.S. and Israeli relations have been tense in recent months after Biden criticized a judicial overhaul that Netanyahu had undertaken despite domestic protests. Biden had faced criticism for not yet having invited Netanyahu to visit the White House since Netanyahu returned to power. Biden is set to meet Tuesday with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial position, at the White House. The contents of Monday's call reflect a similar agenda that the White House put out for the meeting with Herzog on Tuesday. Biden and Herzog plan to discuss ways to advance freedom and security for Israelis and Palestinians, address Iran's \"destabilizing behavior\" and \"deepen Israel\u2019s regional integration,\" according to the White House. Netanyahu, a far-right politician, is in his sixth term in office. His government has moved to expand Israeli settlements in the West Bank, to the consternation of the U.S. and other countries. In March, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman protested to Israel's ambassador to the U.S. about changes in Israeli law that would allow new settlement construction in the West Bank. Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The corruption trial has been ongoing since 2020.",

        "content": "A 12-year-old girl has been charged in connection with what officials say was an acid attack on another girl on a Detroit playground this month. The 12-year-old girl is scheduled to be in court Tuesday afternoon on one count each of assault with intent to do great bodily harm and felonious assault, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym L. Worthy said in a news release. Worthy's office said the girl was released on a $10,000 bond \"with a tether\" Saturday. She was not publicly identified by authorities, and her case will be heard in the court's Juvenile Referee Department. The girl's family have not identified themselves, and it is unclear whether they have an attorney. \u201cThis is an extremely troubling set of allegations,\" Worthy said. \"Instant horrible-decision making can have lifelong effects on others. There is no excuse for this.\" The family of Deaira Summers, the 11-year-old girl who was doused with the acid, told NBC affiliate WDIV that the attack happened July 9 while Deaira and her cousins were playing at Vernor Elementary School. The 12-year-old was involved in an argument with Deaira's cousin. \u201cIt is going to scar her for life,\u201d said Domonique Summers, Deaira's mother. \u201cIt was a traumatizing event that took place, and she\u2019s going to remember this the rest of her life.\u201d After the argument, Deaira and her siblings left the park, but Deaira went back for her purse, and the acid was thrown on her, according to the family's GoFundMe campaign. She suffered second- and third-degree burns on her back, arms and legs. She spent four days in the burn unit at the hospital, the medical fundraiser said. Deaira showed WDIV her injuries, saying she screamed and cried after the unknown liquid was thrown on her. \"At first, it didn't feel like it,\" Deaira said. \"But then, like, two seconds later, it started burning and went through my shirt, my shorts.\" Detroit police did not immediately respond to a request for more information Monday.",

        "title": "A determined mom and a veteran police officer who said this is 'solvable' revived the Gilgo Beach probe",
        "content": "The bodies were found more than a decade ago on a windswept spit of Long Island sand near Gilgo Beach, where the only sounds during the off-season are the screeching of seagulls and waves pounding the shore. There were 11 victims, all but two young women who had been working as sex workers when they vanished. But the mystery of what might have happened to at least four of the women would not be revealed until Friday when a 59-year-old architect named Rex Heuermann, who had been living quietly in the Nassau County town of Massapequa Park and commuting regularly to his office in Manhattan, appeared before a Long Island judge to face murder charges in the deaths of three of the women. Through his attorney, Heuermann pleaded not guilty. He remains a suspect in the disappearance and death of the fourth woman. Until last year, investigators had been wrestling with the seemingly unsolvable crimes as they searched for a predator with a predilection for petite female sex workers with hazel or green eyes. The fact that a 2-year-old girl and a young Asian man were also found at Gilgo Beach in 2010 and 2011 only deepened the mystery and widened the investigation. But last year, Suffolk County\u2019s new police commissioner, a former high-ranking New York Police Department veteran named Rodney Harrison, took over the dormant search and formed what The New York Daily News called a \u201cdream team of detectives\u201d to track down the killer. \u201cI believe this case is solvable and identifying the person or people responsible for these murders is a top priority,\u201d Harrison declared in February 2022. The Gilgo Beach Homicide Investigation Task Force marked the first time local, state and federal officials combined forces to track down a suspected serial killer, Suffolk County officials said. The effort culminated Thursday in Heuermann\u2019s arrest at his Manhattan office. \u201cWe\u2019ll all be sleeping a lot easier tonight,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Friday shortly before Heuermann appeared in court. But the case was marked from the start by apparent missteps and accusations that investigators were dragging their feet because of a cultural bias against sex workers. Melissa Cann, whose 20-year-old sister, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, vanished in July 2007, described in a New York Magazine interview what happened when she told a police officer her sister was missing and that she was a sex worker. \u201cSoon as I told him what she was doing up in Manhattan, it was like he didn\u2019t care,\u201d Cann said.  The struggle to get the wheels of justice moving inspired a Netflix movie in 2020 called \u201cLost Girls\u201d about Mari Gilbert\u2019s effort to find her 24-year-old daughter, Shannan Gilbert, a sex worker from New Jersey who vanished in May 2010 and whose body was later found on Gilgo Beach. Mari Gilbert was stabbed to death in July 2016 by one of her other daughters, Sarra, who suffered from schizophrenia.  Suffolk County investigators \u201cdropped the ball from the beginning,\u201d Shannan Gilbert\u2019s sister, Sherre, said in a May 2022 interview with NBC News. Brainard-Barnes was the first woman to be reported missing, but the investigation did not pick up steam until December 2010, when a team of Suffolk County investigators spurred by Mari Gilbert went out to Gilgo Beach to search for her daughter. A veteran Suffolk County Police Department officer named John Mallia and his search dog, Blue, came across \u201ca set of human remains,\u201d according to a document released Friday in which investigators laid out their arguments for why Heuermann should be denied bail. The remains were later identified as those of 24-year-old Melissa Barthelemy, who was last seen alive in July 2009.  The remains of Brainard-Barnes, Megan Waterman, 22, and Amber Lynn Costello, 27, were found days later wrapped in burlap sacks as were Barthelemy's. \u201cThe cause of all four women was determined to be homicidal violence,\u201d the bail application stated. Prosecutors also said in the document that Heuermann used burner phones and multiple email accounts to search for sites depicting sexual violence, to reach sex workers and to keep up with the investigation of the murders. He used fictitious names for email accounts and phones \u201cto conduct thousands of searches related to sex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography,\u201d according to the document. Search terms often focused on violent sexual acts involving underage girls. Barthelemy\u2019s burner phone was used to make \"taunting phone calls\" to her family members in the days after her disappearance in which a male voice admitted to killing and sexually assaulting Barthelemy, according to the bail document. The calls were later traced to a location near Heuermann's office. Heuermann was in part identified as a suspect by DNA left on pizza crust he threw out in a Manhattan trash can when a hair found on Waterman's body was matched with DNA found on the crust. Heuermann was charged Friday in the deaths of Barthelemy, Waterman and Costello but not Brainard-Barnes or Shannan Gilbert. Thanks to the persistence of her sister, Shannan Gilbert's terrifying last words would become her epitaph. On May 1, 2010, at 4:51 a.m., Gilbert made a 22-minute 911 call shortly after a date with a customer named John Brewer in Oak Beach on Long Island that was followed by two more shorter calls to the dispatcher for help, police said. Brewer has admitted seeing Shannan Gilbert that night but has not been implicated in her death, police said. While Shannan Gilbert\u2019s calls were hard to follow at times and some words sounded slurred, the message police said she repeated was, \u201cSomebody\u2019s after me! There\u2019s somebody after me! There\u2019s somebody after me!\u201d Those 911 recordings were not released by investigators until May 2020 when Suffolk County officials continued to insist Shannan Gilbert was the victim of a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and may have been using drugs or succumbed to the elements after she reached the beach and got disoriented. They continued to maintain Shannan Gilbert was not the victim of a crime even after Michael Baden, the world-famous pathologist who reported that George Floyd died as a result of a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck, did an autopsy and concluded the young woman could have been strangled. \u201cI don\u2019t care if anybody thinks she was on drugs, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Sherre Gilbert said in May 2022. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t believe she would run in a drug-induced paranoia and just strip her clothes all the way off, throw her phone down with her clothes and then just keep running naked into the marsh. I just don\u2019t believe that.\u201d",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Far-right Rep. Lauren Boebert eked out the narrowest of victories in Republican-friendly territory last fall, defeating Democrat Adam Frisch by only 546 votes and stunning political watchers who hadn\u2019t had the sleepy Colorado race on their radar.  Frisch is now seeking a rematch \u2014 and Boebert, a conservative firebrand and culture warrior, hasn\u2019t moderated her policy positions or toned down her rhetoric in her second term on Capitol Hill. Instead, Boebert has been attracting national headlines for taking on President Joe Biden \u2014 and her own GOP leadership. In January, she and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., nearly derailed GOP leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s bid to become speaker in a dramatic standoff on the House floor. She accidentally missed the biggest vote of the year \u2014 a vote to raise the debt ceiling that she had opposed. Last month, she infuriated GOP leaders and colleagues by trying to force a floor vote on impeaching President Joe Biden over border issues before House investigations into him had wrapped up. Now, she\u2019s picking a fight over must-pass government funding and military policy bills, demanding they include right-wing policies to win her vote. \u201cA lot of Republicans have been bewildered by her,\u201d said Dick Wadhams, the former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party from 2007 to 2011. \u201cShe has not changed her operating style, either substantively or just generally.\u201d One House GOP lawmaker, who knows Boebert well, offered this advice: \u201cHer ass needs to get home to go campaign. Cut ribbons, go to bar mitzvahs and take credit for stuff she had absolutely nothing to do with.\u201d In a part of Colorado that leans conservative but is accustomed to electing pragmatic Republicans and Democrats who tend to focus on local issues like water, natural resources and agriculture, Boebert stands out in the wrong ways to a segment of voters, Wadhams said. \u201cThe perception, whether it\u2019s fair or not, is that Congresswoman Boebert has paid more attention to fighting these battles within the Republican Party than she has paid attention to the district,\u201d the former Colorado GOP leader said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m sure her office would refute that. The trouble is it gets obscured by how she conducts herself. And that\u2019s what she\u2019s battling right now.\u201d Asked if she planned to change her approach this cycle, Boebert blamed her close call in 2022 on \u201cballot harvesting\u201d \u2014 a GOP term for third-party collection of absentee ballots \u2014 rather than what Democrats have called her \u201cMAGA extremism\u201d and political charades. \u201cWe need to get voter turnout. I think that all Republicans need to focus on ballot harvesting where it\u2019s legal in Colorado. And, I mean, that\u2019s something that we have to pay attention to or we\u2019re going to continue to be in the mess that we\u2019re in,\u201d Boebert said in an interview as she descended the Capitol steps. \u201cDemocrats chase ballots while we\u2019re chasing voters. And so, I mean, we have to get in the game.\u201d But Boebert also said she\u2019s focused on \u201cdelivering\u201d for Colorado\u2019s sprawling 3rd District that includes rural areas, the cities of Grand Junction and Pueblo, and wealthy ski resorts around Aspen. While she didn\u2019t provide specifics \u2014 and her office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment \u2014 some recent press releases have focused on local issues, like her water payments bill getting a hearing, her bill to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list passing out of committee and securing a $5 million grant for a rural health center in a spending package she voted against. \u201cIn the previous Congress, I wasn\u2019t able to do that as much because we were in the minority,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we have a wonderful advantage of having this majority where I can actually deliver wins for my district.\u201d Once the owner of the gun-themed restaurant Shooters Grill, Boebert, 36, has amassed millions of followers on social media, and a substantial platform outside Congress on conservative podcasts and TV shows, and at political conventions. Democrats, and even some Republicans, say her rising national profile has eclipsed any purported local victories. Boebert has recently grabbed headlines after another conservative hero, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, called her colleague a \u201clittle b----\u201d on the House floor \u2014 an altercation that led to Greene\u2019s ouster from the far-right Freedom Caucus. While Greene has now aligned herself with McCarthy, Boebert remains a thorn in his side. \u201cPeople want the circus to stop,\u201d said Frisch, accusing Boebert of pursuing \u201call sorts of wild goose chases and causing all sorts of drama\u201d that don\u2019t matter to the district. \u201cShe\u2019s one of these people that continues to love to get on Twitter and cable news networks and yell and scream.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not focused on the district, she\u2019s focused on herself,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll hammer her away on that.\" In a phone interview, Frisch said he had needed just \u201ctwo more weeks with only gas station money\u201d to win the 2022 race. Now, he says, he\u2019ll have the time and resources he needs to close the deal. Frisch raised an eye-popping $2.6 million to Boebert\u2019s roughly $818,000 in the second quarter; he reported having $2.5 million cash on hand to Boebert's $1.4 million, according to campaign reports. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to be taking the job any more seriously than she was before. And again, that\u2019s bad for the district and bad for the country,\u201d Frisch said. He promised that if he\u2019s elected his focus would be on local matters like water, rural health care, rural education, farming, ranching and natural resources. But the Democrat still faces an uphill climb in the Republican-friendly district, which former President Donald Trump carried by 8 percentage points in 2020, according to data tracked by Daily Kos. But Frisch, 55, said the 2022 result shows he appeals to nominal Republicans, including Trump voters, calling himself a \u201cvery conservative Democrat running against an extremist.\u201d He wants to join the centrist Problem Solvers Caucus and be one of the five most bipartisan members of Congress. He said he disagrees with his party on energy policy, seeing a larger role for oil and gas alongside clean energy (although he said he\u2019d have voted for the Inflation Reduction Act). And he wouldn\u2019t say whether he\u2019s supporting Biden\u2019s re-election bid in 2024. \u201cI share the concern that the majority of people have that it\u2019s a little disappointing that we\u2019re left with kind of a redo of 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m laser-focused on what happens in CD-3.\u201d The National Republican Congressional Committee, however, is eager to paint Frisch, a former Aspen City Council member, as too liberal for the district. \u201cAdam Frisch is a liberal hack traveling around the district spreading lies like a snake oil salesman. Coloradans see through his act,\u201d said NRCC Regional Press Secretary Delanie Bomar. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a Frisch supporter this cycle and last, acknowledged that Boebert \u2014 with millions of social media followers on the right \u2014 can raise campaign cash off things like her Biden impeachment push. But he pointed out that Boebert voted no on Biden\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure law, which is expected to deliver billions in funding for the Centennial State and will be a major focus of Democratic campaigns next year.   \u201cThere are those who can monetize extremism, monetize selfish politics. And she might do that to some degree, but that only carries you so far when you\u2019re literally not submitting funding requests for roads and bridges and water infrastructure,\u201d Crow said. \u201cYou can only hide that for so long. And clearly last cycle, the jig was up. The jig is even more up now.\u201d Democrats will put a premium on knocking Boebert out of Congress, Wadhams warned, which could force the national GOP to spend money to step in and rescue her. \u201cShe\u2019s become kind of a national symbol of what they want to beat,\u201d Wadhams said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a knock-down, drag-out fight between these two. It\u2019s not gonna be pretty. And it\u2019s gonna go down to the wire.\"",

        "title": "Democrats prepare a vote to censure Rep. George Santos",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres plans to introduce a resolution Monday to censure embattled Republican New York Rep. George Santos for his misleading comments about his education, work history and family background during his successful campaign for Congress in 2022, a spokesperson said. The resolution from Torres, also of New York, will be privileged, meaning the Republican-controlled House must act on it. Once Torres calls for a vote on the measure, it must be voted on or \"tabled\" (effectively killing it) within 48 hours. The resolution comes after Santos' indictment by federal prosecutors and as the House Ethics Committee's investigation into him drags on. Democrats are anxious to deliver some sort of penalty to Santos before the August recess. Torres spokesperson Jacob Long said the hope is that the resolution could be brought for a vote before members leave Washington at the end of July \u2014 unless the House Ethics Committee concludes its investigation into Santos and reveals its recommendation before then. The New York Times first reported on Torres\u2019 plans to introduce the resolution. Democrats had introduced another privileged resolution in May to expel Santos from the chamber, but Republicans successfully referred the matter to the ethics committee. New York Republicans who have criticized Santos and called for his resignation supported the referral with the understanding that the panel would act within 60 days, by Monday. Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., who represents the neighboring district to Santos, said at the time that he would have \"preferred there to be enough votes to expel the sociopath scam artist,\" but that he believed the ethics committee to act \"within 60 days and for the terrible liar to be gone, by resignation or expulsion, before August recess.\" The ethics committee declined to comment. Santos has pleaded not guilty to the 13 federal counts against him, including wire fraud and money laundering. A trial date has not been set. His next court hearing is scheduled for Sept. 7. Censure votes are rare in Congress but do not carry a serious penalty other than the stain of the censure on a member\u2019s record. House Republicans recently censured Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for his role in the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. Democrats were very critical of the vote at the time and Schiff has raised millions since then. While an expulsion vote requires two-thirds of the House in order to be successful, a censure vote only requires a simple majority. In a statement to NBC News, Santos hammered the Democrats' attempts to introduce the censure resolution. \u201cDemocrats on the other side of the aisle have completely lost focus on the work they should be doing,\" he said. \"My record proves that my office is hard at work, serving constituents and crafting keen legislation. The Republican majority is also working hard to get the country back on track and clean up the mess left behind by destructive one-party Democrat rule. It is time to stop the political ping-pong and get real work done.\" CORRECTION (July 17, 2023, 3:59 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the year of Santos\u2019 successful congressional campaign. It was 2022, not 2020.",

        "content": "The FBI is stuck trying to apprehend the \u201cSticky Note Bandit.\u201d The agency is asking for help tracking down a man who dressed as a woman and robbed three banks in the Houston area over 10 days in early July by handing over threatening sticky notes to bank tellers, the FBI said in a Thursday news release. The FBI Violent Crime Task Force dubbed the suspect the \u201cSticky Note Bandit\u201d and is offering a $5,000 reward for any information leading to his capture. The agency tweeted photos of the suspect dressed in a green sweater, black wig, black skirt, black ballet flats, a blue medical mask and black sunglasses caught on surveillance in multiple bank lobbies. The FBI described him as a Black male, approximately 5-foot-8 with a thin to medium build. The first robbery occurred at 1:30 p.m. on July 5 at Hancock Whitney Bank in Houston when the suspect entered dressed as a female, handed a threatening sticky note demanding cash to the teller, and then left on foot with an undisclosed amount of money, the FBI said. No one was injured. He struck again at 12:09 p.m. on July 11 at a Wells Fargo Bank location in Houston, the FBI said. The suspect did not leave with any money after the teller walked away from the counter and locked themselves in the back room. The suspect stayed in the bank lobby for a short time before exiting the building, the FBI said. The third robbery occurred at approximately 3:30 p.m. on July 13 at another Wells Fargo Bank location in Houston and also involved the suspect handing a threatening sticky note to a teller. The robber left the bank on foot with an undisclosed amount of money, the FBI said. Anyone with information can call the Crime Stoppers tip line at 713-222-TIPS (8477) or the FBI Houston Field Office at 713-693-5000.",

        "content": "A sunken tugboat in northern Alabama released thousands of gallons of diesel fuel into the Tennessee River over the weekend, prompting evacuations of beaches and warnings to stay out of the water.  The Florence, Alabama, police department said in a warning Sunday that 3,000 to 5,000 gallons of diesel were released into the river and fuel had begun to wash up on the beaches of McFarland Park. \u201cOfficers are currently at McFarland getting people out of the water that are swimming,\u201d the department said. \u201cPlease stay out of the water and off the beaches until further notice.\u201d Officials had received a report that the tugboat sunk Sunday morning. It\u2019s not clear what caused the boat to sink, George M. Grabryan, emergency management 911 director for the city of Florence and Lauderdale County, Alabama, said Monday. He said no one was on board the tugboat at the time and no injuries or deaths have been reported in connection with the incident. Grabryan said he expects that officials will learn sometime this week what caused the boat to sink. Officials have also been in contact with the Florence company that operates the tugboat. In the meantime, an extensive cleanup process is ongoing by multiple agencies including the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, the Florence fire department and Florence Police Department, and the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency Marine Patrol. Grabryan said boom, which he described as \"a long section of absorbent material,\" has been applied \"across the inference to the port\" and around the tugboat. He explained the boom will \"help contain the diesel on the surface\" of the water and \"keep everything in a pile, hopefully\" to prevent it from spreading. It\u2019s not clear when all the diesel may be cleaned up.  On Monday, officials will work with the Coast Guard to develop a plan to raise the sunken vessel.  \"There\u2019s a crane that\u2019ll be on site today, hopefully to actually assist in raising that vessel,\" Grabryan said. \"We\u2019re fortunate that we do not have these things happen that often. But they\u2019re bringing the right people in here. So we feel really good about that,\" Grabryan said.",

        "title": "Blinken urges Senate to confirm stalled diplomatic nominees",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Antony Blinken is urging the Senate to confirm more than 60 State Department nominees who have been blocked by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., while he seeks information from the administration about the origins of Covid-19. \u201cI am again asking for your leadership to swiftly confirm State Department nominees on the floor,\u201d Blinken wrote in a letter Monday obtained by NBC News. \u201cIf you are holding one or more nominees, I respectfully ask that you reconsider or work with the Department to find a reasonable and expedited path forward.\" \"Our foreign policy and national security interests are depending on it,\u201d Blinken added. Last month, Paul blocked all State Department nominees from clearing Senate confirmation, citing his long-standing request that the department release additional information about the origins of Covid and related government-funded research. Sixty-two diplomatic nominees are awaiting Senate confirmation, including 38 nominated for ambassador positions. All but three of the ambassadorial nominees are career foreign service workers, and some of their appointments have languished in the Senate for more than 18 months, Blinken told reporters Monday. \u201cBy the end of the summer, we expect Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon will all be without confirmed U.S. ambassadors,\u201d Blinken said, also citing vacant ambassadorial posts in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Such postings, Blinken said, were once routinely confirmed through unanimous consent, an arcane rule that allows the Senate to quickly consider requests without a lengthy argument process. If a single senator objects, however, a request is denied. Blinken said America\u2019s adversaries who seize on apparent U.S. weakness could benefit from the blockade of nonpartisan diplomats. The nominees \"represent our most seasoned diplomats,\" and \"their talents are the products of generations of investment by American taxpayers to defend U.S. national security, to sustain and strengthen our alliances and partnerships around the world [and] to ensure that our foreign policy is advancing the interests of the American people,\" Blinken said at Monday's news conference. \"It strains credulity that some of the members of Congress calling most loudly on outcompeting our rivals but at the same time [are] tying our hands behind our back,\" Blinken said. \"We cannot and we must not let this become the new normal.\" A spokesperson said Rand previously made the Foreign Relations Committee aware of his intention to oppose \"all nominees and legislation\" unless the committee's Democratic chair \"stopped obstructing oversight efforts.\" Paul, the spokesperson said in a statement, is \u201csimply trying to access COVID-19 documents being held by various government agencies that are under the jurisdiction of the foreign relations committee.\u201d The spokesperson made no mention of Blinken's accusation that Paul's block harms national security. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller, responding to Paul's statement, told reporters Monday that the agency is cooperating with Paul and said it would continue to \"provide documents that are responsive to his request.\" Paul, however, \"is asking us for documents that are not State Department documents,\" Miller said, and he \u201cshouldn\u2019t be holding our nominees hostage.\u201d \"All that does is hurt our national security,\" Miller said. Another Republican senator, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, has separately blocked hundreds of military promotions, citing his objection to a Defense Department policy that provides paid time off and reimburses travel costs for service members and dependents seeking abortions. Military promotions are usually approved without delay, and President Joe Biden denounced Tuberville's blockade as \"totally irresponsible\" Thursday. Blinken, responding to a reporter's question Monday, said the State Department is in \"close contact\" with the Pentagon over the stalled military appointments. \"That, too, is absolutely detrimental to our national security,\" he said.",

        "title": "Iowa judge temporarily blocks 6-week abortion ban",
        "content": "An Iowa judge on Monday temporarily blocked a new six-week abortion ban from remaining in effect. Polk County District Judge Joseph Seidlin\u2019s order means the law \u2014 which Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law Friday \u2014 will remain on hold while the legal challenge plays out in the court system. \"The court will grant the temporary injunction requested here. In doing so, it recognizes that there are good, honorable and intelligent people \u2014 morally, politically and legally \u2014 on both sides of this upsetting societal and constitutional dilemma. Patience and perseverance are also hallmark traits on both sides, traits that continue to deserve respect,\" Seidlin wrote. \"The court believes it must follow current Iowa Supreme Court precedent and preserve the status quo ante while this litigation\" moves forward, he added. Reynolds signed the ban at a prominent political gathering hosted by an evangelical Christian group. She told attendees, including several Republican presidential candidates, that it represented \u201can ironclad commitment to the smallest and most vulnerable among us.\u201d \"The abortion industry\u2019s attempt to thwart the will of Iowans and the voices of their elected representatives continues today, but I will fight this all the way to the Iowa Supreme Court where we expect a decision that will finally provide justice for the unborn,\" Reynolds said in a statement Monday in response to the injunction. The law went into effect the moment Reynolds signed the bill, but it was frozen by the temporary injunction Monday afternoon. With the law blocked for the time being, abortion restrictions in the state will revert to the previous law, which allowed abortion until the 20th week of pregnancy. The state\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature passed the new law last week during a marathon, 15-hour special session that Reynolds had called for the sole purpose of enacting what she called \u201cpro-life legislation.\u201d The new law includes exceptions for the life of the woman, miscarriages and fetal abnormalities deemed by physicians to be \u201cincompatible with life,\u201d as well as for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest. For those exceptions to apply, a rape must have been reported to law enforcement or a \u201cpublic or private health agency\u201d \u2014 which includes a family doctor \u2014 within 45 days, and incest must have been reported to any of those officials or entities within 140 days. Reproductive rights advocates have said a six-week ban amounts to a total ban because many women don\u2019t even know they are pregnant that early. Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa and the Emma Goldman Clinic, a women\u2019s health care facility in Iowa City, sued to block the law from going into effect Wednesday \u2014 less than 12 hours after the Legislature passed it \u2014 arguing it violates the Iowa Constitution. Reproductive rights groups had said that if the law went into effect immediately, it would send abortion clinics and patients in the state scrambling. Officials with Planned Parenthood said clinics in the state stayed open Thursday until 10 p.m. providing care in anticipation of Friday\u2019s signing. In their challenge, they had asked Seidlin to block the law from going into effect at all. At a hearing Friday that ran concurrent to Reynolds\u2019 signing ceremony, Seidlin said that their request \u201crequires my strong and lengthy attention\u201d and that he \u201ccould not think of anything that could be more insulting\u201d than rapidly issuing a ruling on the challenge. Reproductive rights groups welcomed Monday's ruling. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling means patients across Iowa will be able to access abortion care and retain control over their bodies and futures,\" Ruth Richardson, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, said in a statement. She added that the group \"will continue to oppose this egregious, unconstitutional ban as it works its way through the courts.\u201d The new law came just weeks after the state Supreme Court issued a split decision allowing an earlier six-week abortion ban \u2014 which was enacted in 2018 \u2014 to remain permanently blocked. While the new one is almost identical to the six-week ban that remains blocked, the outcome of the challenge this time around could be different, because there will be a full state Supreme Court issuing a decision. The state Supreme Court\u2019s split ruling last month was a narrowly tailored decision based largely on procedural grounds, meaning it remains possible \u2014 if not likely \u2014 that a full seven-member court could find legal consensus on a new ban. One of the court\u2019s seven justices, Dana Oxley \u2014 a Reynolds appointee \u2014 recused herself from the challenge to the 2018 law because her former law firm represented an abortion clinic that was a plaintiff in the original case. The split decision last month featured three justices suggesting they could support a legal standard \u2014 known as \u201crational basis\u201d \u2014 that could allow a six-week abortion limit to stand in the future. If Oxley were part of the next decision, a clear, legally binding majority on a six-week ban would most likely result. On the other hand, in their challenge to the latest law filed last week, reproductive rights groups argued that a higher standard \u2014 called the \u201cundue burden\u201d standard \u2014 remains applied by judges. While that standard was struck down on the national level in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs ruling last year, which overturned Roe v. Wade, it still remains in effect in Iowa.",

Carlee Russell, 25, was found about 10:45 p.m. Saturday when someone called 911 to report her return home after nearly two days of headlines about her whereabouts, they said. Russell was checked by city fire medics, who took her to a hospital for a more comprehensive evaluation, Hoover Police Capt. Keith Czeskleba said in a statement Saturday night. Russell also provided a statement to police. \"The details of that statement are a part of the ongoing investigation which is expected to continue over the next few days,\" the police department said in a news release Sunday. Russell had been treated and released by Sunday afternoon. Police provided no further information about her condition or where she has been since Thursday night. Authorities found a vehicle belonging to Russell and some of her possessions shortly after 9:30 p.m. Thursday, police said, but they could find neither her nor any child after the call to 911. She also called a family member to report that she had seen a toddler on the interstate. \u201cA single witness has reported possibly seeing a gray vehicle with a light-complected male standing outside of Carlee\u2019s vehicle, but we have no further information on that individual or the vehicle at this time,\u201d Lt. Daniel Lowe said. Police had asked for tips. Russell left work in Birmingham around 8:20 p.m., and she stopped to pick up some food before she made the call about the child, police said. She disappeared sometime after 9:36 p.m., when she called 911 and her family about the toddler. Investigators found Russell's wig, cellphone and purse on the roadway near her vehicle. Her Apple Watch was in her purse, police said. Investigators were analyzing her cellphone, Lowe said. A $20,000 reward was offered by a donor who wished to remain anonymous, and Crime Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward, Lowe said. Russell called and reported seeing a toddler walking on I-459 South and stopped by mile marker 11, police said. Jefferson State Community College said that Russell is a student and that the entire community was praying for her. Hoover is a city of around 92,000 south of Birmingham.",

        "title": "McCarthy rejects RFK Jr.'s comments about Covid and race but won't cancel his testimony",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Monday he disagrees with \u201ceverything\u201d Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reportedly said last week about Covid-19\u2019s being bioengineered \u201cto attack Caucasians and Black people\u201d and about Jewish people\u2019s being \"most immune.\" But McCarthy, R-Calif., rejected calls by Democrats to cancel Kennedy\u2019s public appearance Thursday before a Republican-controlled House committee. Kennedy, an environmental attorney, has pushed conspiracy theories, some of them about the safety of vaccines. \u201cI disagree with everything he said,\u201d McCarthy told reporters in the Capitol. \u201cThe hearing that we have this week is about censorship. I don\u2019t think censoring somebody is actually the answer here.  \u201cI think if you\u2019re going to look at censorship in America \u2014 your first action is to censor him probably plays into some of the problems we have,\u201d he said. A group of House Democrats urged McCarthy and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Monday to block Kennedy from testifying before the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, which Jordan also leads. Kennedy was recorded on video at a New York City dinner discussing \u201cethnically targeted microbes,\u201d during which, according to a video posted by the New York Post, he claimed that \u201cCovid-19 attacks certain races disproportionately.\u201d \u201cCovid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether it was deliberately targeted that or not.\u201d An overwhelming proportion of American Jews are Ashkenazi Jews. NBC News has not verified the video. Kennedy said his remarks were not antisemitic. The Democrats likened Kennedy's comments suggesting that the coronavirus was bioengineered to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people from infection to a technique used by Hitler. They also call on congressional leadership and members of Congress to condemn his comments. \u201cMr. Kennedy has repeatedly and recently spread vile and dangerous antisemitic and anti-Asian conspiracy theories that tarnish his credibility as a witness and must not be legitimized with his appearance before the U.S. Congress nor given the platform of an official committee hearing to spread his baseless and discriminatory views,\u201d reads a draft version of the letter, which was shared with NBC News by a source familiar with it who was not authorized to share a version before it is finalized. The letter is being led by Democratic Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, Dan Goldman of New York and Judy Chu of California, with organizing help from Rep. Kathy Manning of North Carolina. \u201cBy promoting the unfounded notion that scientists are developing bioweapons that can target certain races and exempt others, while referring to Jews as a separate race, Mr. Kennedy is employing a pernicious form of antisemitism that has been used for centuries,\u201d the draft says. \u201cThis technique was used by Hitler claiming that there are biological differences between ethnic or racial groups to portray Jews as a lesser form of humanity, a steppingstone to justifying the annihilation of the Jews during the Holocaust,\u201d it says. Punchbowl News first reported the existence and contents of the letter. A spokesman for Jordan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Kennedy, who is challenging President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination next year, will speak about \u201cfighting antisemitism and championing Israel\u201d at an event in New York City next week, his campaign said. Members of both parties have come under fire for making antisemitic remarks ahead of Israeli President Isaac Herzog\u2019s address to Congress on Wednesday. Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., faced backlash from both Democrats and Republicans after she called Israel a \u201cracist state\u201d at a progressive conference over the weekend.  She apologized, but McCarthy piled on Jayapal on Monday and urged Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to hold people in his party accountable for making antisemitic comments. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first person in the Democratic conference that has continued to make antisemitic comments.\u201d McCarthy said when he was asked about Jayapal. \u201cI think if they want to believe that they do not have a conference that continues to make antisemitic remarks, they need to do something about it, because they\u2019ve defended these individuals time and again.\u201d A number of progressive Democrats said they plan to boycott Herzog's speech to lawmakers, including Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman, both of New York.",

        "content": "Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, apologized Sunday for characterizing Israel as a \u201cracist state\u201d over the weekend. Jayapal's initial comments were quickly criticized by both Democrats and Republicans. More than 40 House Democrats signed a statement condemning them, and a top GOP leader said the House would vote Tuesday on a resolution expressing congressional support for Israel. Jayapal criticized Israel as she tried to quiet a group holding Palestinian flags at a conference for the progressive Netroots Nation over the weekend. \u201cHey guys, can I say something? Can I say something as somebody that\u2019s been in the streets and has participated in a lot of demonstrations?\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cI want you to know that we have been fighting to make it clear that Israel is a racist state, that the Palestinian people deserve self-determination and autonomy, that the dream of a two-state solution is slipping away from us, that it does not even feel possible. \u201cWhile you may have arguments with whether or not some of us onstage are fighting hard enough, I do want you to know that there is an organized opposition on the other side, and it isn\u2019t the people that are on this stage,\u201d she added. Jayapal\u2019s comments were swiftly met with backlash on both sides of the aisle after a video of them was widely circulated on social media. Jayapal walked back her remarks Sunday, issuing a lengthy statement to clarify them while defending the sentiment behind them. Jayapal said she was trying to \u201cdefuse a tense situation\u201d at the conference and offered \u201cmy apologies to those who I have hurt with my words.\u201d \u201cWords do matter and so it is important that I clarify my statement,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cI do not believe the idea of Israel as a nation is racist. \u201cI do, however, believe that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu\u2019s extreme right-wing government has engaged in discriminatory and outright racist policies and that there are extreme racists driving that policy within the leadership of the current government,\u201d she added. In a statement Monday, 43 congressional Democrats condemned Jayapal's remarks. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about Representative Pramila Jayapal\u2019s unacceptable comments regarding our historic, democratic ally Israel, and we appreciate her retraction,\u201d they wrote. \"Israel is the legitimate homeland of the Jewish people and efforts to delegitimize and demonize it are not only dangerous and antisemitic, but they also undermine America\u2019s national security,\" the lawmakers added. The statement was organized by Democratic Reps. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, Greg Landsman of Ohio, Brad Schneider of Illinois, Dean Phillips of Minnesota, Jared Moskowitz of Florida and Kathy Manning of North Carolina. Republicans also criticized Jayapal's remarks. Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, said in a statement that \u201crepeated comments\u201d from Jayapal and other progressive Democrats that denigrated Israel \u201care unacceptable and disgusting.\u201d He also introduced a resolution Monday expressing support for Israel. The resolution, introduced with GOP Reps. David Kustoff of Tennessee and Max Miller of Ohio, says that it's the sense of Congress that Israel \u201cis not a racist or apartheid state,\u201d that Congress rejects all forms of antisemitism and xenophobia and that the U.S. \u201cwill always be a staunch partner and supporter of Israel.\u201d House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., confirmed to reporters that the resolution would be put to a vote Tuesday. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is scheduled to visit the White House and deliver an address to Congress during his two-day trip to Washington this week. House Democratic leaders sought to distance themselves from Jayapal\u2019s remarks in a statement Sunday, saying Israel is \u201cnot a racist state.\u201d \u201cAs House Democratic leaders, we strongly support Israel\u2019s right to exist as a homeland for the Jewish people,\u201d wrote House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar and Vice Chair Ted Lieu, both of California. Still, some Democrats appeared to defend aspects of Jayapal's comments. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., said Monday there\u2019s a distinction between criticism of and opposition to Israel, a longtime U.S. ally. \u201cWe\u2019re critical of the U.S. government every day, and we work here,\u201d Bowman, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told NBC News. \u201cBeing critical of Israel is not anti-Israel, is definitely not antisemitic. I\u2019m a Black man in America \u2014 how the hell can I be antisemitic toward anybody else? I know what it is to suffer and be oppressed and be threatened and killed because of who you are.\u201d",

        "title": "Long Island police search storage units in Gilgo Beach murders",
        "content": "Authorities on Monday executed a search warrant at a second storage unit in Amityville, Long Island, New York, related to the Gilgo Beach murders as the suspect was placed on suicide watch. The Suffolk County Police Department said an initial search warrant had been issued Sunday for a separate storage unit in Amityville. It's unclear who rented the two units, and the owner of both sites, Omega Self Storage, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Suffolk County district attorney, Tania Lopez, declined to comment about what investigators are looking for. The storage facilities were searched as investigators say they are still receiving information from the public after the arrest of Rex Heuermann, a Manhattan architect living in Massapequa Park, Long Island, in connection with a sprawling case that had long gone cold before his arrest. Lopez said the DA\u2019s office cannot disclose any new evidence received from search warrants or from the public after Heuermann\u2019s arrest. Heuermann, 59, was charged Friday with three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of three women who had gone missing from 2009 to 2010. He is also suspected in the disappearance and death of a fourth woman, but that investigation remains ongoing, prosecutors say. On Monday afternoon, the Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Heuermann \u201cis currently on suicide watch which is determined by the County\u2019s mental health staff.\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said Monday that the mountain of evidence, which includes DNA, cellphone records and a witness tip, gives his office confidence it can prove its case. \"We're also confident that we're going to be able to eventually charge that fourth murder,\" Tierney said on CNN. While 11 sets of human remains have been found since 2010 around the area of Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach, a remote stretch along Long Island's South Shore, Heuermann is not suspected in all of the slayings. The deaths, many tied to missing sex workers from the New York and New Jersey area, had set off fears that a serial killer was on the loose. In the wake of Heuermann's arrest on Thursday evening, authorities began searching his home in Massapequa Park, a village across the bay from Gilgo Beach, and his office in midtown Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Michael J. Brown, said Heuermann has been a \"loving\" husband and father to his daughter and stepson, and \"has insisted he did not commit these crimes.\" \"There is nothing about Mr. Heuermann that would suggest that he is involved in these incidents,\" Brown said in a statement. \"And while the government has decided to focus on him despite more significant and stronger leads, we are looking forward to defending him in a court of law before a fair and impartial jury of his peers.\" Heuermann is charged with the slayings of Melissa Barthelemy, 24; Megan Waterman, 22; and Amber Lynn Costello 27. The investigation into the death of a fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, is ongoing with no immediate timeline for when it could be resolved, Lopez said. The women were all believed to be sex workers who advertised on online sites, according to police. They were all found in similar positions and bound with either belts or tape, court documents say. The bodies of three of those women were also wrapped in burlap-type material. After years of an investigation with no prime suspect, a joint law enforcement review jumpstarted in early 2022 brought attention to a Chevrolet Avalanche registered to Heuermann. Such a vehicle had been on investigators' radar during Costello's disappearance from a witness' tip. In addition, authorities said, burner cellphones and credit card activity helped them to link Heuermann with the crimes. Investigators also said they tested hair found on one of the victims that matched Heuermann's wife, who was out of town during the various killings. \"As such, it is likely that the burlap, tape, vehicle(s) or other instrumentalities utilized in furtherance of these murders came from Defendant Heuermann's residence, where his wife also resides, or was transferred from his clothing,\" prosecutors said. A male hair was also found on the burlap used to wrap one of the victims, according to investigators. Police collected a discarded pizza thrown away by Heuermann and swabbed a pizza crust for DNA. Based on lab results in June, investigators said his DNA \"cannot be excluded\" from matching the male hair.",

        "title": "Citing Trump, Pentagon leak suspect Teixeira urges judge to release him while he awaits trial",
        "content": "BOSTON \u2014 The Massachusetts Air National Guard member accused of leaking secret military papers challenged a judge\u2019s decision that he remain behind bars, pointing Monday to the pretrial release of former President Donald Trump and others charged in high-profile classified documents cases. A magistrate judge who ruled in May that 21-year-old Jack Teixeira must remain behind bars while the case plays out found that releasing him would pose a risk that he would attempt to flee the country or obstruct justice. Teixeira\u2019s lawyers are now asking a different judge to reverse that decision. In court papers, the defense attorneys argued that Teixeira has no financial ability or incentive to flee, and claimed the government \u201cgreatly overexaggerates Mr. Teixeira\u2019s risk to national security.\u201d Teixeira\u2019s lawyers noted that prosecutors did not seek to detain Trump \u2014 or his co-defendant, Walt Nauta \u2014 even though the former president and his valet \u201cpossess extraordinary means to flee the United States.\u201d \u201cFormer President Trump and The Trump Organization own properties in multiple foreign countries, and former President Trump has access to a private plane. Yet, the risk of flight posed by their knowledge of national security information, and their abnormal ability to flee, didn\u2019t even result in a request that either surrender their passport,\u201d Teixeira\u2019s lawyers wrote. Teixeira\u2019s attorneys wrote that the \u201cdisparate approach\u201d in these cases \u2014 which are both charged under the Espionage Act \u2014 shows that the government\u2019s \u201cargument for Mr. Teixeira\u2019s detention on this basis is illusory.\u201d Teixeira pleaded not guilty last month to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information. Each count is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Trump has also pleaded not guilty to dozens of felony counts accusing him of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and refusing government demands to give them back. While Trump was not required to surrender a passport \u2014 prosecutors said he was not considered a flight risk \u2014 the magistrate judge directed the former president to not discuss the case with certain witnesses. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and attacked the prosecution as politically motivated. Teixeira, of North Dighton, has been behind bars since his April arrest on charges stemming from the most consequential intelligence leak in years. His lawyers have suggested that he be released to his father and largely confined to his home with location monitoring and no access to the internet. Teixeira is accused of sharing classified military documents about Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and other sensitive national security topics on Discord, a social media platform popular with people playing online games. Authorities say Teixeira, who enlisted in the Air National Guard in 2019, began around January sharing military secrets with other Discord users \u2014 first by typing out classified documents and then sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP SECRET markings. Teixeira worked as a a \u201ccyber transport systems specialist,\u201d essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks. Authorities have provided few details about an alleged possible motive, but accounts of those in the online private chat group where the documents were disclosed have depicted Teixeira as motivated more by bravado than ideology. The judge\u2019s decision to detain Teixeira came after Justice Department lawyers revealed in court filings a history of disturbing online remarks. He wrote in November that he would \u201ckill a (expletive) ton of people\u201d if he had his way, because it would be \u201cculling the weak minded.\u201d Prosecutors also argued he said he may still have material that hasn\u2019t been released, which could be of \u201ctremendous value to hostile nation states that could offer him safe harbor and attempt to facilitate his escape from the United States.\u201d Teixeira\u2019s lawyers wrote that there is no evidence their client \u201cever carried his online conversations into reality or ever endangered any person in his community.\u201d They also said there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that Teixeira is so valuable that a foreign adversary would be willing to smuggle him out of the country.",

        "title": "Firefighters are leaving the U.S. Forest Service for better pay and benefits",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Thousands of federal wildland firefighters could walk off the job if Congress fails to pass a permanent pay increase, officials and advocates warned amid an already scorching summer that could lead to an explosion of wildfires later in the year. From 30% to 50% of the roughly 11,000 firefighters who combat wildfires across millions of acres of land managed by the U.S. Forest Service could resign in coming seasons without a longterm solution to persistently low wages and poor benefits, according to the National Federation of Federal Employees. \u201cThis is an absolute crisis,\u201d said Max Alonzo, an organizer with the federation. \u201cThe majority of people I know already have their applications out for other jobs and they\u2019re just waiting.\u201d The situation has grown so dire that the San Bernardino National Forest in Southern California saw 42 resignations in 48 hours in May, officials said. Many of those firefighters left for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, which is viewed as a prime gig thanks to its generous salaries, robust benefits and manageable work schedule that was recently negotiated down to a 66-hour work week from 72 hours. \u201cSoon there won\u2019t be anybody left,\u201d said Steve Gutierrez, a former hotshot who recently left the Forest Service after 15 years to advocate on behalf of firefighters through the federation. \u201cWe train them and Cal Fire takes them.\u201d Aaron Foye, who resigned from the San Bernardino National Forest last September for a job as an engineer with Cal Fire, estimated staff shortages were so high when he left that only one out of four fire engine crews was staffed seven days a week. \u201cI felt like I was being selfish working at the Forest Service because I wasn\u2019t really providing enough for my family,\u201d Foye said. \u201cAll of our best talent with the Forest Service has bled out in the last two years.\" Lawmakers have introduced bills this year in the House and the Senate that would codify an existing pay increase under President Joe's Biden's infrastructure bill, which temporarily bumped salaries for wildland firefighters by up to $20,000. Without a permanent fix, that increase is set to expire at the end of September and roll back salaries for thousands of federal firefighters. \u201cWe absolutely need Congress to take action and put in place a permanent pay fix,\u201d said Forest Service Deputy Chief Jaelith Hall-Rivera. \u201cIf we\u2019re not able to do that and we\u2019re not able to give them that certainty going into the future, they are going to need to look elsewhere for a position that does provide that certainty.\u201d Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of six senators introduced the Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act, which would keep the current pay raise and help to ensure the federal government can recruit and retain a sufficient firefighting workforce for years to come. In May, a bipartisan bill was reintroduced in the House that would similarly increase pay and address firefighters' mental and physical health, housing, retirement and tuition assistance benefits. It was referred to the forestry subcommittee in June. Federal wildland firefighters have long warned that without a permanent pay raise, their ranks would dwindle even as wildfires continue to increase in both intensity and frequency across the country and beyond. The expertise of federal firefighters is unrivaled when compared with the experience of those who work for municipal and state agencies, which might not include hiking through rugged and dangerous terrain or dropping from helicopters into the middle of a forest. Federal firefighters are also able to traverse state and international borders, including joining Canadian forces this year to battle historic blazes north of the United States. Still, the Forest Service has struggled in recent years to fill vacancies amid rising inflation and severe drought, officials said. In 2021, during one of the most destructive fire seasons in history, the agency also faced shrinking water, food and communications supplies in addition to low staffing levels. This year, the Forest Service has 11,150 wildland firefighters onboard nationwide, or 99% of its goal of 11,300, the agency said. For many men and women on the front lines of fighting fires, the high cost of living means more stress for them and their families, and they begin looking for some relief. At Cal Fire, the state added 37 fire crews to its staff in 2022 after adding 16 in 2021. An additional $671.4 million in the 2022-2023 fiscal year will pay for 1,265 new positions and expand fire crews, air attack operations and additional staff relief, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom's office. A recent report by Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy organization, found that federal firefighters were paid on average 32.51% below their state counterparts. In California, the disparity is just above 56%. \"I wish I had done it sooner,\" Foye said of joining Cal Fire. \"Best decision I ever made.\" Still, when asked if he would return to the federal agency should conditions improve, he said: \u201cI would return in a heartbeat.\u201d As federal firefighters wait for Congress to act, their families say they are held hostage to the whims of lawmakers. Janelle Valentine feels nothing but admiration and pride for her husband, who is a federal firefighter in the Gila National Forest. She gave up her own career in early childhood education to move from Arizona to New Mexico when her husband was placed there, and now lives an hour away from the nearest grocery store while her husband spends nearly half the year fighting fires. She said the sacrifice was worth it because they are both passionate about the Forest Service's mission, but she wonders how much longer they can hold on. \"We\u2019ve been hanging on by the skin of our teeth and wanting it to work out, but we can\u2019t afford it at this point,\" she said. Valentine said they were forced to buy a trailer home for her husband to live in while on assignment because the government housing that was offered was dilapidated and moldy. They are barely able to cover the trailer's cost and their mortgage while Valentine works on earning a master's degree in social work. \"It\u2019s such a low cost of living here, and we\u2019re still drowning,\" she said. \"At what point do you just jump ship with something you love?\"",

        "title": "New Mexico's Maggie Toulouse met with federal prosecutors for 2020 special counsel probe",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The top state election official in New Mexico has spoken with federal prosecutors as part of the special counsel\u2019s probe into the 2020 election, the official\u2019s spokesman said Friday. The meeting with New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver occurred sometime in the past few months, according to spokesman Alex Curtas, who declined further comment. The Justice Department has spent months examining pressure campaigns by Trump associates aimed at getting battleground states won by Democrat Joe Biden to undo the results of their elections. Special counsel Jack Smith and his team have issued subpoenas to election officials in states that Trump disputed, seeking correspondence from Trump associates and campaign aides, and have also lined up interviews in recent months with state officials. The communications with state officials are one prong of a much bigger probe by Smith and his team into efforts to block the transfer of power from Trump to Biden. It is not clear when Smith\u2019s investigation into the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot might end or whether anyone might be charged. A spokesman for Smith declined to comment on Friday. It\u2019s unknown what questions were asked of Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat in her second term, about the 2020 election in New Mexico. After Biden won the state by nearly 11 percentage points, Trump\u2019s campaign briefly challenged the results in court before dropping the lawsuit. Republicans in the state submitted false Electoral College certificates declaring Trump the winner \u2014 though the fake electors added a caveat saying the certificates were submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. Although Democrats control every statewide elected office in New Mexico, with majorities in the Statehouse, false claims of fraud and manipulation of voting machines in 2020 have resonated in some politically conservative communities, including Otero County, where commissioners in June 2022 initially refused to certify election results. Former Otero County commissioner and Cowboys for Trump cofounder Couy Griffin was barred last year from holding public office for engaging in insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson have also spoken with officials from Smith\u2019s office in recent months, according to their staffs. Kathy Boockvar, the chief state election official in Pennsylvania during the 2020 election, said Friday she has not been asked for an interview. It was not currently clear whether state officials overseeing elections in 2020 in Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin \u2014 other states disputed by Trump -- have been interviewed. Claire Woodall-Vogg, the head of Milwaukee\u2019s election commission, said in an email that she met virtually with investigators a month or two ago. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what if any details I can divulge, so not much more to say,\u201d she said. Efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn his loss in Georgia are also the subject of a separate investigation in Atlanta\u2019s Fulton County with local prosecutors saying they expect a decision later this summer on next steps. It was in a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call that Trump suggested Raffensperger could help \u201cfind\u201d the votes necessary to reverse Biden\u2019s win.",

The 47-year-old woman suffered \u201csignificant injuries to her chest and abdomen\u201d and was flown by helicopter to a hospital, the park said. Her condition was not released in a statement Monday. The woman, from Phoenix, walked away from the bison after she and the person she was with spotted two of the animals, the National Park Service said. One of the bison charged. Park officials routinely warn visitors to stay at least 25 yards away from bison \u2014 it was not known how far away the woman was when the bison charged, the park said. The incident remained under investigation Monday, the park said. It occurred Sunday morning in a field on the north shore of Lake Yellowstone, near the Lake Lodge Cabins, it said. Bison can get more easily agitated during mating season, which is from mid-July through mid-August, it said. It\u2019s the first time this year a bison has gored someone at the park, Monday\u2019s statement said. More than 3.2 million people visited Yellowstone last year, and the park over the last decade has frequently topped 4 million, according to statistics from the park service.",

        "content": "Longshot Democratic presidential candidate and conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Saturday morning disputed a report that quoted him saying Covid-19 was \u201ctargeted to attack Caucasians and Black people\u201d and that Jewish people are most immune. In a report by the New York Post titled \u201cRFK Jr. says COVID was \u2018ethnically targeted\u2019 to spare Jews,\u201d video appears to show Kennedy speaking at a dinner in Manhattan. In a discussion on bioweapons and \u201cethnically targeted microbes,\u201d Kennedy claimed that \u201cCovid-19 attacks certain races disproportionately.\u201d \u201cCovid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese,\u201d he said, according to the video published by the Post. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether it was deliberately targeted that or not.\u201d An overwhelming portion of American Jews are Ashkenazi Jews, who are descended from Jews who lived in Central and Eastern Europe. NBC News has not verified the video. In a statement posted to Twitter later in the day, Kennedy defended his remarks, saying they were not anti-Semitic. \u201cThe @nypost story is mistaken. I have never, ever suggested that the COVID-19 virus was targeted to spare Jews,\u201d Kennedy wrote on Twitter. \u201cI do not believe and never implied that the ethnic effect was deliberately engineered,\u201d he continued. Kennedy said that \u201cduring an off-the-record conversation\u201d he had claimed \"that the U.S. and other governments are developing ethnically targeted bioweapons,\" and then he mentioned \"a 2021 study of the COVID-19 virus shows that COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect certain races.\" In January 2022, Kennedy was condemned for implying that Anne Frank, the Jewish teenager who hid from the Nazis and eventually died in a concentration camp, had more freedom than people living under vaccine mandates. Kennedy apologized and said he was \"deeply sorry\" for those remarks.",

        "content": "Six women have been found dead in less than three months in secluded, wooded areas in the Portland, Oregon, region, but law enforcement authorities said they have not found any evidence that the cases are linked. The women's bodies were found within 100 miles of one another, the Portland Police Bureau said in a news release over the weekend. Police have not determined whether they were all homicide victims, but they were all under age 40.  Although news of the deaths was widely circulated on social media, the Portland Police Bureau said there was no reason to believe the deaths were connected. \u201cThese discussions have led to some anxiety and fear in our community, and we want to provide reassurance that the speculation is not supported by the facts available at this point,\u201d the department said in the statement. The body of Kristin Smith, 22, was discovered on Feb. 19 in southeast Portland. Police said her cause of death has not been determined. JoAnna Speaks, 32, was found dead on April 8 inside a barn at an abandoned property in Ridgefield, Washington, about 22 miles north of Portland, authorities said. She died of blunt-force trauma to her neck and head, according to the Clark County Medical Examiner. Charity Lynn Perry, 24, was found in a culvert by the East Historic Columbia River Highway in Multnomah County on April 24, said Deputy John Plock, a spokesman for the sheriff's office. The same day, an unidentified woman was found dead inside a tent in Portland, police said, adding she may have been Indigenous, and there were no signs of foul play. Bridget Webster, 31, was discovered on a rural road in Polk County on April 30, and Ashley Real, 22, was found in a wooded area on May 7. \u201cIt\u2019s just so heartbreaking, and it\u2019s really hard to put into words,\u201d Robyn Speaks, JoAnna Speaks' sister, told NBC affiliate KGW of Portland. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hitting us more that it\u2019s real, and we keep seeing on the news all these new girls.\u201d JoAnna Speak's stepsister Ariel Hamby said in an interview with \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d that she was horrified and heartbroken. \u201cShe was an amazing sister and wonderful daughter and a fantastic mother,\u201d Hamby said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about my sister anymore even if it\u2019s not one person doing this.\" Webster's stepgrandfather, who would provide only his first name, Tom, because he said he has been inundated with phone calls about the women, said he raised Webster \"until she left when she was a freshman in high school.\" \u201cShe was a good girl until I lost contact with her years ago,\u201d Tom said, adding that he changed her diapers and taught her how to play basketball. Multiple police and sheriff's departments are investigating the cases, and the Portland Police Bureau said it was also working with the county and state medical examiner's offices. \u201cOne of the main things that they are going to be looking at is the manner of death and the weapon,\" Bryanna Fox, a former FBI special agent, told \u201cNBC Nightly News.\u201d \"If that\u2019s consistent across all of these victims, then that will be a huge point.\u201d",

        "title": "Appeals court pauses order limiting Biden admin social media contact",
        "content": "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 A federal appeals court Friday temporarily paused a lower court\u2019s order limiting executive branch officials\u2019 communications with social media companies about controversial online posts. Biden administration lawyers had asked the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to stay the preliminary injunction issued on July 4 by U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty. Doughty himself had rejected a request to put his order on hold pending appeal. Friday\u2019s brief 5th Circuit order put Doughty\u2019s injunction on hold \u201cuntil further orders of the court.\u201d It called for arguments in the case to be scheduled on an expedited basis. Filed last year, the lawsuit claimed the administration, in effect, censored free speech by discussing possible regulatory action the government could take while pressuring companies to remove what it deemed misinformation. COVID-19 vaccines, legal issues involving President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter and election fraud allegations were among the topics spotlighted in the lawsuit. Doughty, nominated to the federal bench by former President Donald Trump, issued an Independence Day order and accompanying reasons that covered more than 160 pages. He said the plaintiffs were likely to win their ongoing lawsuit. His injunction blocked the Department of Health and Human Services, the FBI and multiple other government agencies and administration officials from \u201cencouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech.\u201d Administration lawyers said the order was overly broad and vague, raising questions about what officials can say in conversations with social media companies or in public statements. They said Doughty\u2019s order posed a threat of \u201cgrave\u201d public harm by chilling executive branch efforts to combat online misinformation. Doughty rejected the administration\u2019s request for a stay on Monday, writing: \u201cDefendants argue that the injunction should be stayed because it might interfere with the Government\u2019s ability to continue working with social-media companies to censor Americans\u2019 core political speech on the basis of viewpoint. In other words, the Government seeks a stay of the injunction so that it can continue violating the First Amendment.\u201d In its request that the 5th Circuit issue a stay, administration lawyers said there has been no evidence of threats by the administration. \u201cThe district court identified no evidence suggesting that a threat accompanied any request for the removal of content. Indeed, the order denying the stay \u2014 presumably highlighting the ostensibly strongest evidence \u2014 referred to \u2018a series of public media statements,\u2019\u201d the administration said. Friday\u2019s \u201cadministrative stay\u201d was issued without comment by a panel of three 5th Circuit judges: Carl Stewart, nominated to the court by former President Bill Clinton; James Graves, nominated by former President Barack Obama; and Andrew Oldham, nominated by Trump. A different panel drawn from the court, which has 17 active members, will hear arguments on a longer stay.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Kerry Kennedy, a sister of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., lambasted her brother in a brief statement Monday after a report quoted him as saying that Covid-19 was \"targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people\" and that Jewish people are most immune. \"I strongly condemn my brother\u2019s deplorable and untruthful remarks last week about Covid being engineered for ethnic targeting,\" Kerry Kennedy said in a statement released by the nonprofit group Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, where she is president. \"His statements do not represent what I believe or what Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights stand for, with our 50+-year track record of protecting rights and standing against racism and all forms of discrimination,\" she added. On Saturday, the New York Post published an article that included a video that appeared to show Robert Kennedy speaking at a dinner in Manhattan about bioweapons and \"ethnically targeted microbes\" in which he claimed that \"Covid-19 attacks certain races disproportionately.\" \"Covid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese,\" he said, according to the video published by the Post. \"We don\u2019t know whether it was deliberately targeted that or not.\" An overwhelming proportion of American Jews are Ashkenazi Jews, who are descended from Jews who lived in Central and Eastern Europe. NBC News has not verified the video. In a statement on Twitter later in the day, Kennedy defended his remarks, saying they were not antisemitic. Former Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., also weighed in Monday, tweeting that he condemns his uncle's remarks. Robert Kennedy has been repeatedly criticized for pushing conspiracy theories, some about vaccines. Kerry Kennedy, 63, his sister, also blasted her brother, 69, when he launched his presidential bid in April. \"I love my brother Bobby, but I do not share or endorse his opinions on many issues, including the COVID pandemic, vaccinations, and the role of social media platforms in policing false information,\" she said at the time. \"It is also important to note that Bobby\u2019s views are not reflected in or influence the mission or work of our organization.\" Other members of their family have also rebuked him over the conspiracy theories about vaccines and misinformation he has spread for years. At the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denounced the remarks Monday. \"The claims made on that tape is false. It is vile,\" she said at the daily briefing. \"They put our fellow Americans in danger if you think about the racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories that come out of saying those types of things. It's an attack on our fellow citizens, our fellow Americans. So it's important that we speak out.\"",

        "content": "In the days after her husband was reported missing to the Texas Army base where he was stationed, Cam Chamberlain sent a series of urgent Facebook messages to a longtime friend: When he disappeared, she said, he left her with no food and no money. She wasn\u2019t working, she was estranged from her family, and her efforts to get help from the Army had gone nowhere, two longtime friends said.   \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she wrote to Jessica D\u2019Lynn Pyles in a message the friend shared with NBC News. \u201cI\u2019m alone. I just want the pain to go away. I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d Within a week of that message, Cam Chamberlain\u2019s death was announced, and the next day, her husband \u2014 who had been missing for 11 days \u2014 was discovered alive. Spc. Craig Chamberlain, 23, had \u201cwillfully\u201d disappeared from his unit, according to Army officials at his post, Fort Cavazos. Military authorities have offered few answers about what happened, and friends of Cam Chamberlain, who was in her late 20s, have said they\u2019ve found no solace in the aftermath of her death: There have been no autopsy, no obituary and no funeral.  Officials confirmed her death in a statement May 25. The couple lived off base, and a spokeswoman for the Killeen Police Department referred questions about the case to Fort Cavazos authorities, who put out a statement confirming the death. They didn\u2019t provide details about when or where she died, and her cause and manner of death haven\u2019t been disclosed.  Army investigators launched a criminal probe. A spokeswoman for the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division declined to comment further, citing an ongoing investigation. \u201cI can\u2019t even mourn her death the way family should, because it\u2019s as if she never existed at all now,\u201d said Shandy Eubank, one of the longtime friends. The day after authorities announced that his wife had died, Craig Chamberlain was found in \u201crough shape\u201d in the Killeen area, said his mother, Virginia Chamberlain. In an interview with NBC News, she declined to say where her son is now. A spokeswoman at Fort Cavazos declined to discuss his status in the Army, saying he was the subject of an administrative investigation in connection with his disappearance. The inquiry has been completed but can\u2019t be disclosed because of privacy rules. A quick marriage and an overseas assignment Craig and Cam Chamberlain met a few years ago through a dating app and were married in 2020, according to her Facebook page. Though Eubank believed the couple had rushed things, they initially seemed happy, she said. \u201cThe way he treated her \u2014 he put her on a pedestal,\u201d said Eubank, who met Cam when they worked together at an insurance company in Waco more than a decade ago. \u201cHe treated her better than anyone had treated her.\u201d She was a people person, Eubank said \u2014 someone who was as outspoken as she was happy and goofy.   D\u2019Lynn Pyles said, \u201cYou knew where she stood on things.\u201d In an interview with a Texas newspaper, Cam described her husband as laid back, patient and carefree. He has a unicorn tattooed on the upper part of his right arm, his mother said. Craig Chamberlain was assigned to the 704th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company at Fort Cavazos, formerly known as Fort Hood, one of the largest Army bases in the country, which sits roughly midway between Austin and Waco.  A rift emerged between the couple over time, which Cam attributed partly to difficult family dynamics, Eubank said. Cam publicly identified as a transgender woman and had a rocky relationship with her own family, telling friends that her mother had \u201cdisowned\u201d her, Eubank and D\u2019Lynn Pyles recalled. Efforts to reach Cam Chamberlain\u2019s mother were unsuccessful. Messages left at a phone number listed as her brother\u2019s weren\u2019t returned. Cam told Eubank that she struggled with her husband\u2019s family, as well. Eubank remembered her friend recounting a conversation in which her mother-in-law challenged her ability to be in a loving relationship: \u201cHow can she know she loves Craig when she doesn\u2019t know what gender she is?\u201d  Virginia Chamberlain called the comment \u201cvery, very inaccurate.\u201d \u201cDid we have our differences? Absolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will say I never bullied Cam. I never said a statement like that to Cam. Not once did that ever come out of my mouth.\u201d Craig Chamberlain\u2019s father, Gordon Chamberlain, added that although he hadn\u2019t met Cam before his son married her, \u201cI said we\u2019d treat Cam like anyone else that comes into our lives.\u201d The Army was sending Craig to South Korea, and Cam planned to \u201cstick with him,\u201d Eubank said, despite the growing tension between them. Fort Cavazos officials confirmed he had been ordered to South Korea in December for a long-term assignment.  In a Jan. 8 Facebook post, Cam seemed excited about the trip \u2014 and traveling to other parts of Asia. \u201cCan\u2019t wait for the FOOD,\u201d she wrote in a post that D\u2019Lynn Pyles captured in a screenshot and shared with NBC News. \u201cI love real Asian food.\u201d But months passed, and the couple went nowhere. Then, on March 20, she posted that her husband\u2019s orders had been deferred for six months \u2014 and that she learned so only the night before he was to have left. \u201cYou never know what comes next,\u201d she wrote in another post that D\u2019Lynn Pyles shared. \u201cPlans change faster than this Texas weather.\u201d A spokeswoman for Fort Cavazos declined to comment on the deferment, saying it was part of the base\u2019s administrative investigation.  A missing soldier By the time Cam Chamberlain reported her husband missing \u2014 he had last been seen May 15 \u2014 their relationship had become so \u201ctoxic\u201d that she had planned to split up with him, she told D\u2019Lynn Pyles in a Facebook message. \u201cEven though I\u2019m getting divorced I still can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s in danger,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI still love him and I\u2019d blame myself if anything happened to him.\u201d In other messages to D\u2019Lynn Pyles, she pleaded for money. In one message, she said her husband had refused to pay her their Basic Allowance for Housing, or compensation provided to service members and their families who live off base. \"He went missing and left me with no food. No nothing,\" she said in a message. \"His command won\u2019t help me.\" In a statement, officials at Fort Cavazos didn\u2019t address Cam Chamberlain\u2019s claim. They said that \u201ccaring for our soldiers and families is a top priority.\u201d  \u201cIf soldiers and family members have pay issues that cannot be resolved at the unit level, they should seek help from their unit\u2019s personnel office,\u201d the statement said. In another message, Cam shared a missing person flyer for her husband \u2014 a flyer later circulated by local media that said Craig disappeared without his keys and phone. He\u2019d been suffering from a \u201cbout of extreme depression,\u201d the flyer said. As she searched for her husband, she tracked the sometimes grim responses to his disappearance on social media. In a lengthy comment thread on a local station\u2019s Facebook page, people made jokes about how the base\u2019s name change didn\u2019t prevent another soldier from disappearing and casually suggested his wife may have had something to do with it. In response to a user who said she hoped \u201chis wife\u201d didn\u2019t see the comments, Cam responded: \u201cI have seen them. All of them. And I hope that each and every one of them goes through the pain I am going through.\u201d She also began to talk more about her husband\u2019s disappearance. In a message to D\u2019Lynn Pyles, she said her husband had \u201clied\u201d to her about South Korea. She didn\u2019t offer additional details, but in an interview with the Killeen Daily Herald while Craig was missing, she said Army officials had recently told her that he had stopped reporting to work in March. \u201cHe told me he was going to work the whole time, so I didn\u2019t think anything of it, but in reality, he wasn\u2019t really going to work,\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201cHe was just saying he was going to work.\u201d Virginia Chamberlain cast doubt on her daughter-in-law\u2019s account, saying photos from the time show her son with long hair and a scruffy face. \"You can\u2019t report for duty like that in the Army,\" she said. Officials at Fort Cavazos said in a statement that Craig Chamberlain had \u201cfailed\u201d to travel to his new assignment for \u201cunknown reasons.\u201d A spokeswoman for the base declined to comment when she was asked about the accuracy of Cam Chamberlain\u2019s comments. A plea for help The last time D\u2019Lynn Pyles heard from Cam was May 21, when she sent a Facebook message asking for $40. She\u2019d gone to her mother\u2019s house in Fort Worth \u2014 a place where she said she was \u201cno longer welcome\u201d \u2014 and had spent the last of her money on a ride home to Killeen. D\u2019Lynn Pyles said she couldn\u2019t give her the money \u2014 she\u2019d just gone shopping and had $20 to her name, according to a screenshot of the message. \u201cI totally understand,\u201d her friend responded. Four days later, D\u2019Lynn Pyles messaged Cam \u2014 \u201cAre you good?!\u201d \u2014 and then called. There was no response, and D\u2019Lynn Pyles soon found herself on Facebook groups linked to Fort Cavazos searching for answers. The next day, on May 26, Craig Chamberlain was found alive. It was a week and a half after he had been reported missing and not long after a civilian search party set out with his parents to find him.  Virginia Chamberlain said the group \u2014 made up of \u201ccomplete strangers\u201d \u2014 were \u201cwith us every single day looking for our son.\u201d \"And they were there when we found him,\" she said. \"They are now family to us.\" The base offered few specifics about how or where Craig was found. In a statement, military officials accused him of willfully disappearing and said the search involved the \u201ctremendous efforts and support by the Fort Cavazos and Killeen communities.\u201d Virginia Chamberlain also declined to say where her son was found. She described his path forward as a \u201chard journey\u201d with \u201ca lot of healing to take place.\u201d \"This is a very delicate story,\" she added. \"There\u2019s a lot of lives that have been affected by it. My heart truly does break for Cam\u2019s friends and Cam\u2019s family \u2014 even with the things that have gone on in the past.\" For D\u2019Lynn Pyles, Cam\u2019s death was especially hard given that one of the things her friend had wanted most was a committed partner, someone with whom she could establish the kind of family she didn\u2019t have. \"Craig has been the longest relationship she\u2019d had since I\u2019ve known her,\" D\u2019Lynn Pyles said in a text. \"She was longing for THAT kind of love.\" Now, D\u2019Lynn Pyles added, she just wants the truth about Cam \u2014 \"even if it breaks my heart.\"",

In a news release, the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division cleared Spc. Craig Chamberlain, 23, in the May death of Cam Chamberlain and said her cause and manner of death will be released after an autopsy is completed. The statement, which was released Friday, added that because the investigation is active, no additional details will be released. In a text message Monday, Craig Chamberlain's mother disputed the date of death the Army released for Cam Chamberlain \u2014 May 25 \u2014 and said the Criminal Investigation Division previously told her family it was May 23. An Army spokeswoman could not immediately clarify the discrepancy. Fort Cavazos officials announced the death on May 25. \"I am glad that the truth is coming out and I know that there will be more truth to follow,\" Virginia Chamberlain said in the text. \"We do not know why it has taken so long for this to come to light.\" She called on the Killeen Police Department to release the details surrounding her daughter-in-law's death so \"Cam's loved ones and friends can have closure.\" The police department previously referred questions to the lead agency investigating her death, the Criminal Investigation Division. NBC News reported Thursday that close friends of Cam Chamberlain\u2019s have remained frustrated in the weeks after her death because authorities have released few details about it. \u201cI can\u2019t even mourn her death the way family should, because it\u2019s as if she never existed at all now,\u201d said a friend, Shandy Eubank. Efforts to reach Cam Chamberlain's family have been unsuccessful. Friends of hers have said she was estranged from relatives. Craig Chamberlain, of Fort Cavazos\u2019 704th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company, went missing May 15 in what the Army described as a \"willful\" disappearance. The base has said he was found May 26. Army officials have declined to provide more details about his status or the disappearance, which was the subject of internal inquiry. A spokeswoman for the base said the Army does not comment on administrative actions. Craig Chamberlain\u2019s mother previously said a civilian search party found him in the Killeen area \u2014 near where Fort Cavazos is located \u2014 in \"rough shape.\" She declined to provide additional details, citing his privacy, but she described his path forward as a \"hard journey\" with \"a lot of healing.\" Craig and Cam Chamberlain were married in October 2020. He was assigned to a new post in South Korea in December, Army officials have said, but for \u201cunknown reasons\u201d he never traveled to the country. In a Facebook message to a friend after Craig Chamberlain went missing, Cam Chamberlain said her husband had lied to her about the assignment, and in an interview with the Killeen Daily Herald she said military officials told her that he stopped reporting to work in March \u2014 though she said he never told her about it. In the days before her death, Cam Chamberlain told friends that her marriage had become \"toxic\" and that she was divorcing her husband.  Eubank said her friend had struggled with her husband and his family partly because of her gender identity. Cam Chamberlain publicly identified as a transgender woman. Virginia Chamberlain has rejected that claim, calling it \u201cvery, very inaccurate.\u201d ",

Scandrett said at a news conference Sunday afternoon. \"The entire state of Georgia can breathe a little easier tonight.\" Law enforcement tracked the suspect from Saturday's bloodshed to an area near the border between Henry and Clayton counties, about 20 miles south of Atlanta, he said. Officers exchanged gunfire with the man twice before he was \"neutralized\" and ultimately declared dead, Scandrett said. Officials had been looking for Andre Longmore, 40, and a GMC Acadia SUV he was believed to be driving. Authorities were armed with an arrest warrant Sunday based on four allegations of murder. Officials said Longmore fatally shot four residents of Dogwood Lakes Drive and Dogwood Ridge about 10:45 a.m. Saturday. On Sunday, Hampton Police Chief James Turner identified the victims as Scott Levitt, 67; Shirley Levitt, 66; Steve Blizzard, 65; and Ronald Jeffers, 66. He said motive remained a mystery. Longmore was a resident of Dogwood Lakes Drive community. The Acadia was stolen from Blizzard, Turner said. \"This community is grieving,\" Hampton City Manager Alex Cohilas said. \"We're thankful we have achieved a resolution in which no more loss of life has occurred.\" Turner said his city of more than 8,000 last reported a homicide in 2018 and is one of the safest communities in the state. \"It's just not normal for us,\" he said of Saturday's violence. Scandrett spoke of \"a couple\" of law enforcement officers who were injured Saturday. The worst of Saturday's injuries were suffered by an officer struck in his back by gunfire, the sheriff said. The officer was conscious, breathing and expected to survive, Scandrett said. At least one other officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries, officials said. The killing spree and law enforcement's response were under investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.",

        "title": "EPA Power Plant Rule Anchors Biden's Wider Climate Agenda",
        "content": "(To get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.) The Environmental Protection Agency has been on a rulemaking frenzy this year, issuing a suite of new regulations over the past few months designed to cut pollution. From rules on how to dispose of waste from coal-fired power plants to new requirements for passenger vehicles, the drumbeat has felt almost non-stop. On Thursday, the EPA announced the biggest measure yet: new greenhouse gas emissions standards for power plants that run on coal and natural gas. The move will create new requirements for new gas-fired power plants, as well as some natural gas and coal-fired plants already in operation. The outcome, the Biden Administration hopes, is that the rule will lay the groundwork for an electric grid powered entirely by clean power by 2035. \u201cThe President\u2019s \u2018100% by 2035\u2019 goal for the power sector [has] been the north star that has guided policy,\u201d said Ali Zaidi, President Biden\u2019s national climate advisor, ahead of the announcement. \u201cAnd part of that approach is setting rules of the road that can help facilitate and reinforce that shift.\u201d On its own the rule is significant. But the rule is also designed as a crown jewel of sorts, the anchor of a much bigger set of rules and regulations. To understand its significance, it\u2019s important to look at it as part of that bigger picture. Biden entered office with a promise to put climate at the center of his national agenda, and it was clear from the beginning that he viewed the private sector as critical to that goal. His top climate officials hit the road almost immediately to engage with industry, and the Administration quickly embraced public-private partnerships aimed at cutting emissions. His international climate agenda, too, focused on catalyzing private finance. Most importantly, his central legislative effort, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), focused almost entirely on positive incentives to encourage industry rather than penalties, proverbial carrots rather than sticks. EPA Administrator Michael Regan described his goal to me last summer as using regulation to create \u201crules of the road\u201d rather than penalizing industry. \u201cThis is not a hostage negotiation,\u201d he told me. \u201cThis is a conversation about how we\u2019re all going to win the future.\u201d Regan told me that, in the past, companies have viewed the drumbeat of EPA regulations as \u201cdeath by 1,000 paper cuts.\u201d He wanted to present the power sector with \u201ca suite of regulations\u201d in quick succession, he said. \u201cThe power sector then can take a look at the economics to comply with those rules at one time, or they can say \u2018hey, to hell with the past, let\u2019s invest more quickly in the future.\u2019\u201d Taking such an approach with power plant rules was always going to be challenging. Power plant regulation has been a source of tension between industry and the federal government ever since the Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that the EPA needed to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Since then, successive administrations have tried and failed to write rules that would stand up to legal scrutiny\u2014often due to intense blowback from industry. The attempt to win over power companies is evident in the final language of the rule announced this week. While the rule will clearly push some coal-fired power plants to close early and impose new costs on the construction of new natural gas plants, it goes to lengths to ease the transition for industry. Companies face less stringent standards for existing plants that will retire before 2035 compared to 2040, as well as for plants that are designed to operate less frequently. And the companies that do choose to install carbon capture technology to meet the standards will benefit from tax incentives in the IRA, helping them stomach the cost. Many regulated companies will of course continue to complain about the regulations\u2014and indeed many corporate executives are skeptical of the new power plant rules. But it\u2019s hard to deny that the Administration has tried to engage companies. The Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor owned utilities, issued a carefully parsed statement on the new rule, delaying judgment but thanking the Administration for working closely with industry as it formulated them. \u201cThey\u2019ve been great partners with us,\u201d Pedro Pizarro, the CEO of Edison International, which provides electricity for 15 million in Southern California, told me last fall. \u201cWe really appreciate that.\u201d Those compromises seem to have worked, as many companies are responding to the array of nudges\u2014and not just in the power sector but across the economy. The IRA has driven a spike in investment in U.S.-based clean technology manufacturing even as the Administration is still putting the finishing touches on how to implement and disburse money under that law. And a Deloitte survey from earlier this year found that 65% of C-suite officers had increased their climate action in response to the changing regulatory climate. Some activists will complain that the Administration\u2019s approach to climate\u2014including with this regulation\u2014has been too business friendly. But, without Democratic control of Congress and with a Supreme Court that has severely limited the ability of agencies to maneuver, options are limited.",

        "title": "Inside Ukraine's Push to Try Putin For War Crimes",
        "content": "In the office of Andriy Smyrnov, the deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration, the wanted posters spread across the desk serve as a kind of mission statement. They show the faces of five Russian officials, led by President Vladimir Putin, next to a list of the charges Ukraine has leveled against them: aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity. \u201cWe had these printed as a reminder,\u201d Smyrnov says while pacing around his desk on the third floor of the presidential compound, one floor down from the chambers of his boss, President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cThere\u2019s no alternative to putting Putin on trial,\u201d he says. The question is where, and under whose authority. As the top aide to Zelensky on judicial matters, Smyrnov, 42, has spent the past year charting a path to an improbable destination: a courtroom, somewhere, with Putin in the dock. Every step has been painstaking, with Ukraine\u2019s closest allies often blocking the way. But Smyrnov, who has no experience in international law, has made surprising progress. Last fall, he says, \u201cNobody even wanted to talk to us about a tribunal. Now look at how quickly the civilized world is waking up.\u201d On March 16, investigators working with the UN Human Rights Office reported that Russian forces committed crimes against humanity, a rare rebuke from a UN body against a sitting member of the UN Security Council. The following day, the International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC) issued a warrant for Putin\u2019s arrest, charging him in connection with another alleged war crime: the mass deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. Less than two weeks after that, the U.S. set out a plan to put Putin on trial for the crime of aggression, which some scholars describe as the root of all war crimes. None of these developments are likely to achieve justice as Zelensky, Smyrnov, and their team have envisioned it. The ICC\u2019s warrant will be toothless unless Putin travels to a country willing to arrest him, and the U.S. plan for an \u201cinternationalized national court\u201d remains vague; some legal experts say it would be easy for Putin to sidestep or ignore. But it all feels like a breakthrough to Smyrnov and his colleagues. \u201cWhen it came to creating a tribunal,\u201d he says, \u201cthere were a lot of issues on the agenda that seemed unattainable half a year ago. In reality, they were well within reach.\u201d Before the invasion, Smyrnov\u2019s role in the presidential headquarters mostly involved pushing paper. He worked on judicial reforms and helped prepare documents for Zelensky\u2019s signature. A lot of that changed on the morning of Feb. 24, 2022, when Russian missiles began raining down on cities across Ukraine. Holed up in their bunker beneath the presidential compound, Zelensky and his aides realized that their judicial system could soon be hijacked. If the Russians seized control of the courts, they could begin issuing legal decisions that would undermine Zelensky\u2019s authority or legitimize the puppet government that Moscow wanted to install in his place. To prevent that, Smyrnov rushed to the server room of a Kyiv courthouse and, with help from an officer of Ukraine\u2019s security services, broke through the door. Once inside, they unplugged the court\u2019s internal computer network\u2014the judicial equivalent of blowing up a bridge to thwart the advance of enemy tanks. \u201cIn terms of separation of powers, that\u2019s probably not what you should do,\u201d he says, pulling up photos he took that day of the courthouse servers, their wires ripped out and dangling. \u201cBut these were extraordinary times.\u201d By early April, the President\u2019s legal department shifted to a new challenge. The Russian military\u2019s retreat from the Kyiv region exposed gruesome atrocities in places they had occupied. The streets of Bucha, a suburb of the capital, were littered with the bodies of dozens of civilians; hundreds more were later found in mass graves around town. In the wake of that massacre, Zelensky\u2019s calls for justice intensified.\u201cAccountability must be inevitable,\u201d he told the UN on April 5, 2022, the day after he saw the evidence of war crimes in Bucha for himself. Under international law, the Security Council can create a tribunal to prosecute war crimes, as it did after the wars in Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s. But that would not work in the case of Ukraine, because Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, holds a veto over all its rulings. As they looked for an alternative, Smyrnov and his team found themselves studying the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals and reviewing evidence from crime scenes and mass graves around Ukraine. \u201cI used to get a kick out of horror movies,\u201d Smyrnov says. \u201cBut after some of the things I\u2019ve seen, after some of the exhumation reports, any horror movie feels like a joke.\u201d Ukrainian investigators have received nearly 80,000 reports of war crimes and opened thousands of cases against Russian military personnel accused of committing them. But when it comes to prosecuting Putin, Smyrnov and his team discovered, Ukrainian courts do not have the authority. It would take an internationally authorized tribunal to overcome the legal immunity Putin enjoys as a sitting head of state, says David Scheffer, a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes. At first, the ICC in The Hague seemed like a logical venue. But unlike 123 other countries, Ukraine and Russia never ratified the treaty that created the ICC in 1998. Neither did the United States. President Trump even sanctioned the ICC leadership in June 2020 for their attempts to investigate the use of torture in Afghanistan. The Ukrainians decided to push instead for the creation of an ad hoc tribunal focused on holding Russia\u2019s leadership responsible for the crime of aggression, which the Rome Statute defines as a war crime. \u201cIn this whole gruesome story, the decision to start the war is the original crime,\u201d says Christian Wenaweser, Liechtenstein\u2019s ambassador to the UN. \u201cIt\u2019s the crime of the leadership, the ones who ordered the invasion, and we need to have a mechanism to prosecute them for it.\u201d But who would give authority to such a tribunal? Ukraine decided to seek it from the 193 member states of the UN General Assembly; unlike the 15-member Security Council, Russia holds no veto there. Through the spring and summer of 2022, Smyrnov and his colleagues appealed to dozens of foreign countries and international institutions for support. But the talks were often frustrating. Prosecuting the crime of aggression tends to appeal to its victims, like Ukraine, and to smaller countries like Liechtenstein, which does not have a military. The U.S. and other big powers see less advantage in letting foreign courts judge their decisions on when to make war. Behind closed doors, U.S. diplomats warned Ukrainian officials that a tribunal could hinder Washington\u2019s ability to reach Putin in an emergency\u2014if, for instance, the war escalated into a nuclear standoff, two of the officials said. Others said that it could prolong the war by impeding peace talks. One European official even told his Ukrainian counterparts the tribunal could only be fair and balanced if it included a Russian judge. Smyrnov found it hard to respond to such arguments without losing his temper. As the evidence of Russian atrocities piled up in agonizing detail, he often fell back on sarcasm. \u201cLet\u2019s just write Putin a greeting card and say, Dude, you\u2019re awesome. We bow our heads. We won\u2019t judge you for your crimes of aggression,\u201d Smyrnov says between pulls on a vape, summarizing a point he has often made to foreign officials. \u201cOr how about we stop being afraid,\u201d he says. \u201cHow about we team up and hold him accountable.\u201d By September, the effort reached what he calls \u201ca psychological plateau.\u201d European institutions and parliamentary assemblies had backed the idea of a tribunal. But with heads of state, Smyrnov says, \u201cwe reached the limits of our ability to communicate.\u201d The lawyers asked Zelensky to step up the pressure, and he pushed harder for a tribunal in his talks with foreign leaders. As Ukraine made gains on the battlefield, the prospect of holding Russia to account became easier to imagine. In January, the European Parliament voted 472 to 19 to support a tribunal\u2019s creation. The vote was symbolic, but it gave Kyiv hope that momentum might turn its way at the UN General Assembly, where Ukraine could count on only a few dozen votes. Russia\u2019s influence there was one obstacle. But support from the U.S. was also far from certain. In December 2022, Congress authorized the U.S. to aid \u201cinvestigations and prosecutions\u201d related to the war in Ukraine. Yet the Pentagon raised objections, concerned about setting a precedent that could put U.S. officials in legal jeopardy. (A decision whether to give intelligence to the ICC for its case against Putin is due to come before President Biden soon, according to the New York Times.) At the end of March, Smyrnov\u2019s goal of an ad hoc tribunal seemed to get a boost from the Biden Administration. In a speech on March 27, America\u2019s ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaack, said the U.S. would endorse an \u201cinternationalized national court\u201d that Ukraine could establish with support from the U.S. and its allies, not the UN. \u201cThis kind of model,\u201d she said, would \u201cdemonstrate Ukraine\u2019s leadership in ensuring accountability for the crime of aggression.\u201d To some legal scholars, the approach looked deeply flawed, as it would still allow Putin to claim immunity as a sitting head of state. \u201cUnfortunately it plays into Putin\u2019s hands,\u201d says Scheffer, who held the same post as Van Schaack during the Clinton Administration. \u201cPutin and his colleagues can ignore the prospect of prosecution for the crime of aggression.\u201d Skeptics view the move as an attempt by Washington to derail the prospect of a UN-authorized tribunal. But Ukraine sees it as another step on the road to justice. A few months ago, Smyrnov says, the U.S. opposed any tribunal that would hold Russian leaders accountable. The Ukrainians have not given up on the hope of a resolution in the UN General Assembly that would empower a tribunal under international law, and they plan to keep rallying support for such a vote in the months ahead. \u201cWe\u2019ve overcome our fear,\u201d Smyrnov says. \u201cThe rest should be easier.\u201d\u2014With reporting by Julia Zorthian",

        "title": "White Women Must Do More To Confront Racism",
        "content": "In 2019, we decided to host anti-racism events in white women\u2019s dining rooms for one specific reason: To turn the age-old adage, \u201cit\u2019s rude to talk about politics at the dinner table\u201d on its head. This is what we\u2019ve learned\u2014if you don\u2019t talk about racism, you can\u2019t dismantle it. But it isn\u2019t just over the dinner table that this \u201cniceness\u201d rules. In the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020, you were eager, frenzied even, to do this work. A mere two years later, not only is that excitement for anti-racism work gone, the pendulum has swung in the other direction, into a verifiable whitelash against anti-racism work. If white womanhood is a house, your need to be perfect is the foundation. It is this need for perfection that makes it impossible to engage in antiracism work. Being perfect is the key to your happiness, to your success, to your very existence. Perfect hair. Perfect clothes. Perfect grades. Perfect nails. Perfect weddings. Perfect bodies. Perfect adoring and supportive wife and mother. Perfect employee and colleague. White skin. The foundational principle of perfection in a white supremacist society like ours is rooted in whiteness. Without it, your A\u2019s will never be straight enough, your MVP trophies not shiny enough, your flowery dresses a bit wilted. Of course, white skin alone doesn\u2019t render you perfect, but without it, you have no chance. White skin is a necessary (yet still insufficient) ingredient of perfection. The con, of course, is there is no actual recipe for perfection, as there is no such thing as perfection. Read More: How the \u2018Karen Meme\u2019 Confronts the Violent History of White Womanhood This makes your endless quest for perfection a trap. You will never be pretty enough. You will never be thin enough. You will never be smart enough or successful enough or rich enough. You will never be enough. Yet white women will die trying. Especially over dinner. We call it the \u201cThree Point Plan for Perfectionism.\u201d It goes like this: You\u2019ve been taught generation after generation that talking about politics over a meal is rude. Being rude is the enemy of perfection. Being perfect is your number one life goal, so you will not talk about racism. White women regularly mention having been \u201cburned\u201d on social media for saying the \u201cwrong thing.\u201d You have been publicly humiliated, often at the hands of a fellow white woman, who is angling to show you how much more perfect she is at antiracism work. Yes, you even compete in the antiracism space. Getting called out makes you want to stop the work, to stop engaging. If you aren\u2019t already perfect at it, then you don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. Yet if you stop the work, you can\u2019t make progress. Then there are those situations in which the critique of you is coming from a woman of color. This will hit you in a deeply uncomfortable place. After all, you are not used to having us challenge you\u2014and on a topic we absolutely know more about: being on the receiving end of racism. This, in particular, infuriates white women. Us publicly calling you out on your racism. Us publicly telling you that you are not perfect. Antiracism work depends on your acknowledging your imperfections, namely how you have been born into and nurtured by a white supremacist society. This means acknowledging that you are not the expert on how it feels to be on the receiving end of racism, which means you do not get to decide what is and is not racist. Just like men don\u2019t get to decide what is and is not sexist. It means acknowledging that you will get it wrong, that you will feel embarrassed, and that you will struggle to make progress. In spite of these obstacles and this necessary discomfort, you will have to pick yourself up and get back into the work\u2014work that is messy, not tidy. Work that is tables turned upside down, not neatly set. Work that is imperfect. So, why show up? Why do this work now? Because you must. You\u2019ll do it because not only is it the right thing to do, but you know that your lives, and your kids\u2019 and your grandkids\u2019 lives, depend on your showing up, even when things get hard. You will show up because you understand that white supremacy hurts you too. You are doing this not to save us, but to free yourselves. So the next time you think things like, \u201cI didn\u2019t pipe up on Facebook because I don\u2019t want to be attacked,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to say the wrong thing,\u201d or \u201cThe last time I called someone out at a dinner party, my husband was grumpy with me for a week,\u201d think about this: The only wrong move is remaining silent, sitting on the sidelines, accepting your role in white supremacy. Don\u2019t do nothing out of the fear of doing it imperfectly. Get in there. Read. Listen. Learn. Speak up. Speak out. Show up. Roll up your sleeves. And when you receive criticism, consider that maybe it\u2019s just that: a critique, and not an attack. Maybe this disagreement isn\u2019t a fight. Maybe you don\u2019t know more than the Black, Indigenous, or brown woman attempting to set you straight. And isn\u2019t freedom from white supremacy worth some level of conflict? Isn\u2019t it more important to eradicate racism than to be liked by everybody? You\u2019ve never been liked by everybody in the first place! In the end, you cannot even start the process of extracting white supremacy until you extract the need to be perfect. The need to be perfect is not just harmful to us, it\u2019s harmful to you. Aren\u2019t you tired of never being enough?

        "title": "Racism Is Not a Mental Illness\u2014But It\u2019s Complicated",
        "content": "Everyone knows that Law & Order plotlines are often, as they say, ripped from the headlines. But Dr. Alvin Poussaint, 88, knows this on another level: An emeritus professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, he has had the unusual experience of seeing his ideas incorporated into a season 12 episode of the long-running show. In it, a white working stiff murders a Black CEO in a dispute over a New York City taxicab. When the trial begins, a respected Black psychiatrist takes the stand to present his idea that the defendant suffers from \u201cextreme racism,\u201d a mental illness. His lawyers argue that extreme racism has such a complete hold on the defendant that it mitigates their client\u2019s legal responsibility for the murder. In the final moments, the audience is encouraged to feel that it\u2019s a victory for justice, for law and order, when the jury rejects the psychiatrist\u2019s ideas, Poussaint tells me with a tinge of disdain. In the real world, Poussaint was that psychiatrist. Sort of. While he never brought his ideas to the witness stand inside the New York City courthouse behind those massive stone steps that Law & Order made famous, in 1999 he shared his theories on the link between mental health and extreme forms of bigotry on the op-ed pages of the New York Times. In doing so, he helped set off a debate that ended with the American psychiatric establishment publicly rejecting the concept\u2014partly on the grounds that so many people are racists. But even now, after nearly a decade during which the number of hate crimes has steadily increased, the question of the relationship between bigotry and mental illness has never fully been resolved. In fact, recent high-profile incidents have made public perception of that dynamic perhaps as muddled as ever. The issue comes up in relation to everything from major mass shootings to pop-culture discourse. The racist attack at a Buffalo, N.Y., supermarket, for which the gunman pleaded guilty this week to state murder and domestic terrorism charges, prompted calls for the country to \u201cget serious about mental health\u201d as well as pleas not to talk about the shooting as a matter of psychiatric illness rather than a racist hate crime. Read more: Anti-Black Violence Has Long Been the Most Common American Hate Crime\u2014And We Still Don\u2019t Know the Full Extent It\u2019s hard to distinguish what psychiatric experts have decided not to define, to separate what Poussaint calls \u201ceveryday racism\u201d\u2014covering the span from systemic discrimination to microaggressions\u2014from the extreme version, which he and others have described as the point at which bigotry so deeply shapes behavior that a person struggles to function and sometimes becomes dangerous. But the question is more than just a thought experiment. If extreme racism were to become accepted as a mental illness per se, more suspects in hate-crime cases could potentially have recourse to mount \u201cinsanity\u201d defenses in court. And given all the mass shootings and disturbing public events in which extreme racism appears to have played some part since Poussaint first described his ideas, it\u2019s also hard not to wonder. Might developing a research-backed extreme-racism diagnosis\u2014and sound treatments\u2014have saved lives? Though the FBI typically releases data each fall detailing the prior year\u2019s hate-crimes statistics, the agency has not yet done so in 2022. But social conditions are rife, experts say, for the increase to continue. (In 2020, the most recent year for which FBI data is available, the agency reported 8,263 incidents\u2014an increase of nearly a thousand over the prior year, despite 452 fewer agencies reporting\u2014and most experts believe the real number is higher.) Police have noted that 47 out of 100 people arrested for hate crimes in New York City in early 2022 \u201chave prior documentation of an [emotionally disturbed person] incident.\u201d So the stakes are high for the nation\u2019s courtrooms to respond to the trauma unleashed by that dynamic\u2014and for Americans to decide what constitutes a just outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d says Sander Gilman, a historian at Emory University who researches the relationship between health, science, law, and society, and who has long taught a course on extremism. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to start with two things that I call Gilman\u2019s Law: not all racists are crazy, but crazy people can be racists.\u201d Thanks in part to the influence of pop culture\u2014not least those TV police procedurals\u2014many assume that insanity pleas are common. In reality, mental-health defenses are rare, and even more rarely lead to reduced punishment. Mounting that kind of defense requires time and significant resources to gather evidence and expert testimony, so in practice it is not an avenue available to all defendants. In England and the U.S., courts began to reliably consider the mental health of defendants only in the 19th century. The M\u2019Naghten rule, a standard for determining a defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of a crime, was established in 1840s England. It holds that only the sane can be held responsible for their actions. As a result, the question of mental fitness\u2014sufficient sanity to participate meaningfully in one\u2019s own defense\u2014is sometimes evaluated before a trial. (Whether the state has an obligation or right to treat such an illness in order for the person to then stand trial is, Gilman says, a question that goes back as far as the idea of such a defense.) Once a competency decision has been made, the accused who do go to trial have the right to a defense. In some cases, that may include an option for a jury to find the defendant not guilty by reason of mental disorder. In others, ideas about the mental health of the defendant may more informally shape what evidence is presented. But so-called \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d defenses are used in only about 1% of cases, says Michael Boucai, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law and an expert on mental health and other social issues in courtrooms. Those defenses are successful in even fewer cases; in fact, such a tactic often backfires or results in a defendant confined for a longer term inside a hospital than that person would have spent in prison, sometimes with no end date. And even rarer\u2014though not unheard of\u2014is an attempt to use racism or other bigotry as an indicator of mental-health challenges, he says. \u201cI think it would be extremely hard,\u201d says Boucai, \u201cI mean extremely hard, to succeed on the theory that extreme racism per se\u2014particularly subscription to a theory\u2014is a mental illness for the purpose of criminal responsibility. Just because you have a psychologist or psychiatrist saying this person is mentally ill does not mean the law has to [accept] that.\u201d (Nor does the defendant: Dylann Roof, the white man who shot and killed nine Black worshippers inside a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015\u2014whose legal team used words like \u201cdelusional,\u201d \u201cabnormal,\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d to describe their client\u2014rejected advice from his lawyers to attempt to avoid the death penalty by allowing them to argue that he was insane or suffering from a mental defect at the time of the shooting.) Some fear that raising mental-health issues in court runs the risk of bolstering inaccurate myths about the mentally ill. In reality, mentally ill people are disproportionately more likely to become the victims of crime, and most do nothing to victimize others. And, as has been observed after so many headlinemaking crimes, suspects from privileged groups are more likely to have their actions described as illness in need of treatment instead of criminal evil meriting punishment. Some experts fear that shifting the conversation to questions of mental health can also draw attention away from hateful ideas embraced by the person accused of the crime\u2014ideas that are today often shared by people, including public figures, whose mental health is not questioned. That\u2019s how important social problems that require the nation\u2019s attention are transformed into one individual\u2019s medical problems, says W. Carson Byrd, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. Column: We Need to Take Action to Address the Mental Health Crisis in This Pandemic That line of thinking is particularly problematic in a culture prone to dismiss the need for systemwide reforms to address inequality, Byrd says. It can foster an emphasis on quick fixes for the world\u2019s long-standing problems with bigotry. (In 2012, for example, a team of British researchers announced that an existing heart and blood-pressure drug appeared to reduce implicit bias after a study involving just 36 subjects.) \u201cWhite supremacy is a very normal part of society,\u201d says Byrd, who is also the faculty director of research initiatives at his university\u2019s National Center for Institutional Diversity. It is not a good or productive part of society, he points out, but a deeply entrenched one. \u201cOne of the detriments of trying to look at racism as a form of psychopathology or mental illness is that it makes that [illness] abhorrent, as if everything else is working in a certain [non-racist] way.\u201d Research has also long shown that bigotry is not an inborn human trait, but rather something learned from our environments, Byrd says. While racism can influence one\u2019s mental health, describing racism itself\u2014even \u201cextreme racism\u201d\u2014as a mental illness implies that bigotry exists beyond our individual and collective control. \u201cBy medicalizing [extreme racism], making it something curable, a mental-health disorder, it pulls away from having those broader conversations about how society is impacting people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just try to figure out, \u2018How do we fix this one person?\u2019\u201d This problem, Boucai notes, can already be clearly seen in discussions about gun crime, and mass shootings in particular: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to understand these crimes and the discourse of insanity provides one way to do it,\u201d says Boucai. \u201cBut I think we can see where that sort of language is irresponsible and potentially undermines a just result.\u201d In other words, if a mass shooter is simply insane, then wholesale gun-law reform can, to some, seem unnecessary, even unwise. When bigotry is involved, that supposed insanity might, some who oppose Poussaint\u2019s ideas believe, undermine systemwide efforts toward equity\u2014or at least toward greater safety for those most likely to be targeted. In 1999, when Poussaint wrote his op-ed advocating for increased research into possible psychiatric treatments for extreme racism, he was the author of acclaimed books about the effects of racism on Black mental health and a veteran of public controversy. Years earlier he\u2019d argued publicly that racial pride among Black Americans could be taken to an unhealthy extreme. By the 1990s, he may have been best known for his work with Bill Cosby, consulting on scripts for The Cosby Show in a massively popular effort to disrupt stereotypes. Poussaint first published his ideas about extreme racism weeks after a man named Buford O. Furrow Jr. shot and seriously injured four children and an adult inside a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, then shot and killed a nearby Asian-American postal worker. When captured and ultimately convicted, Furrow told investigators his actions had been motivated by hate. Reporters unearthed information indicating that Furrow had close relationships with known white nationalists, and also that he had been evaluated by Washington State\u2019s mental-health system only months before the attack. He\u2019d even told officials after a previous arrest for assault that he\u2019d \u201cfantasized,\u201d about mass murder. To Poussaint, this story signaled a growing threat posed by a failure to recognize that, while highlighting and combating systemic racism is important in preventing discrimination, so is identifying and helping individuals motivated by bigotry who might go so far as to injure or kill others. Read more: 11 People Were Killed in 48 Hours in Mass Shootings Across America. It\u2019s Likely to Get Worse The idea had been brewing for years. In 1993, a Jamaican immigrant named Colin Ferguson had shot and killed six people and injured 19 aboard a New York commuter train after years of personal struggles that he blamed on white and Asian people, whom he referred to as \u201cdevils.\u201d Ferguson had been pinned down by passengers on the train to stop the shooting but, while defending himself at trial, he argued that someone else committed the crime. (Ferguson\u2019s lawyers had planned to argue that he was insane at the time, suffering from something called \u201cBlack rage,\u201d another condition debated but not officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and that was the subject of a Law & Order episode.) After the train shootings, Poussaint\u2014a Haitian-American son of immigrants\u2014had noted Ferguson\u2019s trajectory: racist thinking, delusions that had come to dominate his life, then mass violence. This was a textbook case of extreme racism. \u201cExtreme racism crosses the line and is out of control,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust like somebody can have a little bit of anxiety, but if they have anxiety to the point that it is immobilizing, then it is a mental disorder.\u201d Mass shooters behind hate crimes are, as he sees it, in a similar state: \u201c[They] weren\u2019t functioning individuals. They were impaired by their mental pathology.\u201d When the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the guide that mental-health professionals use to make their diagnoses, was published in 1980, clinicians like Poussaint considered racism\u2014not extreme racism, but what he calls everyday racism\u2014a potential symptom of several conditions, from paranoid personality disorder to generalized anxiety disorder. Racism alone is not sufficient to diagnose a patient with one of those conditions, but an extreme racist, Poussaint says, likely suffers from delusions. Such people live with multiple symptoms including paranoia; they are likely to project negative traits or outcomes onto entire groups and sustain those beliefs even in the face of strong countervailing evidence. Many embrace conspiracy theories. Some may grow violent. In fact, Poussaint argued in a 2002 Western Journal of Medicine article, the extreme racist often begins with \u201cverbal expression of antagonism, progresses to avoidance of members of disliked groups, then to active discrimination against them, to physical attack, and finally to extermination (lynchings, massacres, genocide). That fifth point on the scale, the acting out of extermination fantasies, is readily classifiable as delusional behavior.\u201d Poussaint was not the first person to raise the idea that extreme racism is itself a mental illness. But he was among those leading the call for the American Psychiatric Association, publishers of the DSM, to consider putting it in subsequent editions of the manual, which has a long history of evolving, often slowly, in response to research and norms. When his op-ed ran, it seemed to Poussaint, people pounced. Some of his fellow Black psychiatrists argued that such a diagnosis would unleash a wave of legal excuse-making, helping no one but the violent racists themselves. Poussaint counters that other health diagnoses have yet\u2014nearly 200 years after psychological concerns officially entered American courtrooms\u2014to produce rafts of acquittals. And some clinicians and researchers argued that there are other ways of attacking racism besides treating it as an illness\u2014educational programs, diversity initiatives, policy changes. That\u2019s a point Poussaint says he doesn\u2019t oppose, at least when it comes to everyday racism. Those steps can help racists who embrace repugnant ideas while remaining functional parts of society. But those aren\u2019t the people he\u2019s talking about. \u201cRacism negatively impacts public health,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association told TIME in a statement. \u201cThe American Psychiatric Association has been focusing on this in the DSM by identifying and addressing the impact of structural racism on the over- or underdiagnosis of mental disorders in certain ethno-racial groups. From time to time we have received proposals to create a diagnosis of extreme racism but they have not met the criteria identified for creating new disorders.\u201d To this day, Poussaint believes that extreme racism is very likely its own disorder in need of study, possible diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment, he told me in September from his home in Massachusetts. But after retiring about 2\u00bd years ago at the age of 86, he says he\u2019s too far out of the professional mix to continue to push for an extreme racism diagnosis. I ask Poussaint what he thinks might have happened if extreme racism had become its own diagnosable condition listed in the DSM. Extreme racism might have been a topic on talk shows and a more frequent topic of news coverage, he says. With research and public information campaigns, the need for intervention could have been as clear as it is for heart attacks; the steps to do so as well-known as CPR. \u201cWe\u2019d get away from treating it as if [extreme racism] is normative,\u201d Poussaint says, \u201clike a cultural difference because America is a racist country. We have made it normative by not calling it what it is. Even people in general society, friends and relatives and even the afflicted individual, would recognize it as a disorder and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alright.\u2019 People who get swept up by anxiety and can\u2019t function, they don\u2019t think they are normal. They say, \u2018This is taking over my life. I need some help.\u2019 [A diagnosis] clues the family to say, \u2018This person is really troubled and we have to get them some help.\u2019\u201d \u2014with reporting by Solcyre Burga, Mariah Espada and Simmone Shah",

        "title": "EPA Power Emissions Rule Hinges on Carbon Capture Tech",
        "content": "Acertain irony has threaded its way through the endless rulemaking filings, legal challenges, and political vicissitudes of the decades-long fight to stop U.S. fossil fuel power plants from spewing carbon dioxide emissions into the air. A recent example is last year\u2019s Supreme Court West Virginia v E.P.A. ruling. At the time, it was widely seen as a serious blow to the Biden Administration\u2019s ambitions to cut power sector emissions. Now, the agency is using the parameters set by that ruling to pound an industry responsible for 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions once more. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling blocked the EPA from forcing power sector emitters to switch to clean energy, saying instead the agency could only mandate emissions cuts based on technology that could be deployed \u201cwithin the fenceline\u201d of power facilities themselves. This morning, the EPA unveiled a new rule that would do just that, requiring most coal and natural gas power plants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040. Where the previous mandates were based on so-called \u201cgeneration shifting\u201d as the best available means of power plants reducing emissions\u2014i.e. shutting down and building renewables instead\u2014the new emission reduction rules are based on the capabilities of technology such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) that companies could deploy on the grounds of their power facilities themselves. So, last year\u2019s setback is now something of a legal backing for the EPA\u2019s new position. After all, the Supreme Court has reiterated that mandating emissions cuts based on what power plants can do on-site falls squarely within the agency\u2019s purview. Still, today\u2019s rule doesn\u2019t actually mandate what solutions power companies should use. They could use CCS or burn hydrogen in former natural gas plants, which are some of the options that the new standards are based on\u2014though those options are likely to be much more costly than generation shifting. And if power producers happen to think that setting up multimillion dollar systems to filter out thousands of tons of carbon dioxide is too expensive of a hassle, they always have the option to shut down those coal or natural gas power plants and switch to cheaper, cleaner solar or wind energy. \u201cThe EPA will have a strong argument that carbon capture technology is something that can be implemented by or at a facility and within the fence line,\u201d says Ethan Shenkman, a partner at law firm Arnold and Porter and former EPA deputy general counsel under the Obama Administration. Still, he says, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re home free,\u201d since there\u2019s other ways that litigants could try to prove that the agency exceeded its authority in these new emissions regulations. Read more: The Inflation Reduction Act Includes a Bonanza for the Carbon Capture Industry Another recent irony is that it\u2019s the supposed capabilities of carbon capture technology, long championed by the fossil fuel industry and distrusted by environmentalists, that\u2019s now being used as a cudgel against the owners of coal and natural gas power plants. And the prospect of such regulation has led to some interesting mixed messages on the actual readiness of the technology from some fossil fuel players. Utility National Grid, for instance, says in its net zero plan that it might not shut down all its natural gas plants by 2050, but that that\u2019s alright because it\u2019ll use CCS to suck out their CO2 emissions from smokestacks and bury them underground. Some environmentalists might see that as a hand-wavy promise of using as-yet unproven tech to justify continued investments in natural gas. But according to National Grid, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable. As the company writes on its website, the technology has \u201ctraditionally been viewed as expensive and unpractical at scale. This is changing, however, as investment and research into carbon capturing technologies takes off.\u201d Yet, as it became clear the EPA might begin basing emissions standards on the fact that it was feasible to use such technology, lawyers representing National Grid took a very different line. Last June, a coalition of power companies that included National Grid submitted comments to an EPA white paper on CCS, saying that the power companies\u2019 work in CCS technology gave them \u201cparticular insight into the low likelihood that CCUS [carbon capture, utilization, and storage] will be sufficiently developed to be considered as a viable CO2 control technology in forthcoming proposed rules under Clean Air Act Section 111.\u201d National Grid distanced itself from the group\u2019s comments in an email to TIME. \u201cComments like these are based on consensus and not a perfect representation of company views,\u201d a company representative wrote, adding that they support CCS \u201cwhen it is technologically and economically viable.\u201d Others see things differently. \u201cThis technology has been held up by industry as a way to continue to use fossil fuels for electric power generation and meet whatever emission reductions goals they\u2019ve set,\u201d says Lissa Lynch, the director of the federal legal group at the Natural Resource Defense Council\u2019s climate and clean energy program. \u201cNow that they\u2019re being called on it, they are claiming that it\u2019s too speculative, too far in the future, too expensive, too difficult.\u201d The question of whether CCS technology is feasible and relatively affordable could be of crucial significance in an expected slew of legal challenges to the EPA\u2019s rule once it is finalized. Plaintiffs may try to prove that the agency has exceeded its authority under the Clean Air Act by drafting emissions reduction requirements based on technology they can\u2019t realistically use. The industry might also target the EPA\u2019s slow permitting process in lawsuits. To fully implement CCS technology, power companies need to build special wells where they can store the carbon they captured. Some fossil fuel advocates have already begun pointing to the EPA\u2019s permitting backlog for these wells to argue the agency isn\u2019t doing enough to allow companies to actually implement the technology. \u201cThe very same agency that is pushing the rule out saying that the industry should rely on CCS to meet these targets, is slow walking the permitting process,\u201d says Tom Pyle, president of the pro-fossil fuel American Energy Alliance. To counter these arguments, the EPA may end up trying to prove that CCS is viable. Shenkman says the agency will likely start permitting a lot of wellheads for carbon capture. Recent government action, like federal funds being funneled towards CCS demonstration projects, as well as the huge new tax credits for storing carbon that Congress passed in last summer\u2019s climate bill, could also be a significant boon to the EPA\u2019s argument. Those developments, says Jessie Stolark, director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, have made a huge difference in the prospects for using the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s really a sea change,\u201d she says. More broadly, the EPA has the right and obligation to use regulations to force CCS development along, just as it did in previous mandates for power plants to filter out other pollutants, according to Lynch. The technology has to be feasible\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s available at the hardware store. \u201cEvery single time, industry claims that it\u2019s going to be impossible, and then when standards are in place, industry innovates and comes up with better, faster, cheaper ways of reducing pollution,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cBut there\u2019s no incentive to do any of that innovation until those standards are in place.\u201d Correction, May 11 The original version of this story misstated the name of the Natural Resources Defense Council. It is the Natural Resources Defense Council, not the National Resources Defense Council.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been in dance therapy for all of 90 seconds when I embarrass myself. The group is doing a follow-the-leader exercise, with one person picking a dance move that everyone else must mimic. When my name is called, I panic and launch into an extremely uncool move that could be generously described as disco-inspired, my cheeks flaming as a group of strangers mirror it back at me. I\u2019d traveled to the University of Colorado\u2019s School of Medicine to take this humiliating stab at vulnerability in the name of science (and my own sanity). The Colorado Resiliency Arts Lab (CORAL), an ongoing research project at the school, aims to help people who are burned out from their jobs build resilience and improve their mental well-being. For three months, participants meet weekly for 90-minute sessions that weave together therapy, community, and art to provide an outlet for the stressors of working in health care. But this week, the group includes one participant who doesn\u2019t work in health care: me, a health journalist with a personal interest in whether CORAL\u2019s program really works. After writing about the pandemic for three years, I had started seeing in myself some of the warning signs of burnout, as compiled by Christina Maslach, who has researched burnout for four decades: emotional and mental exhaustion, feeling negative or cynical about work, and believing your work doesn\u2019t matter or your efforts aren\u2019t enough. Tick, tick, and tick. Toward the end of 2022, I experienced significant writer\u2019s block for the first time. The \u201cquiet quitting\u201d trend\u2014doing the bare minimum at work\u2014spoke to me more than it should have. And as the world forgot about COVID-19, I sometimes wondered if there was any point in continuing to cover it. I genuinely love my job, so I wanted to fix those issues before they got worse. But when I asked Dr. Google \u201chow to cure burnout,\u201d I couldn\u2019t find much. That\u2019s because it\u2019s not totally up to me, Maslach says. Fixing burnout is truly possible only when employers eliminate the conditions that produce it in the first place and pare down workloads, support and listen to employees, and give people control over their work and time, Maslach told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not that coping is not important,\u201d she says. But if we see it as the solution, we\u2019re blaming workers and \u201cnot actually changing the stressors themselves.\u201d Read More: Ambition Is Out But what if the stressors don\u2019t change, no matter how much we want them to? In an ideal world, sure, every boss would want to eliminate burnout. But businesses are driven by profits, employees are often told to do more with less, and too many people scrape by on minimum wage and no benefits. Leaving workers responsible for their own burnout may not be the answer, but in many cases, waiting for work to change feels like an equally hopeless path. Is there anything I\u2014and the 42% of office workers who said they felt burned out in a late-2022 survey\u2014could do to make an imperfect situation better? I turned to the scientific literature for answers. Plenty of researchers have looked for ways that individuals can ease their burnout, but many don\u2019t seem to work. A 2022 research review analyzed 30 previous studies on burnout interventions for doctors. Many of the programs\u2014free food, subsidized gym memberships, weekly meetings with a psychologist\u2014didn\u2019t yield significant results. Nearly all of those that did involved a group element, like wellness classes or mentorship programs. That makes sense, even though it\u2019s harder to DIY; other research also suggests social support can improve mental health and protect against burnout. But some individual interventions make a difference. Studies suggest physical activity, a proven mood booster and stress reducer, can decrease burnout. Mindfulness practices such as meditation and yoga have been shown in some, but not all, studies to help, apparently by building resilience and improving emotional regulation. Creativity practices may also chip away at burnout by reigniting passions and facilitating \u201cflow,\u201d or being engrossed in a task. So: socializing, exercise, meditation, and arts and crafts. Not exactly groundbreaking stuff. The first three are foundational aspects of good health, recommended by nearly every expert I\u2019ve ever interviewed. Despite how familiar they felt, I used them as the protocol for my highly unscientific burnout-busting experiment: I\u2019d work out at least three times a week and do yoga at least once a week, meditate daily, and complete a daily creativity exercise. (I chose to doodle my emotions.) Since my experiment coincided with TIME\u2019s return-to-office plans\u2014mandating my presence in the office three days a week\u2014I figured I\u2019d get my workplace social-interaction fix whether I liked it or not. As a longtime gymgoer, I also found my exercise quota manageable. The idea of meditating and doodling, however, filled me with dread. The most in touch I\u2019ve ever been with my artsy side was when I started painting by numbers during the desperate boredom of lockdown. And you know how mindfulness experts often say there\u2019s no wrong way to meditate? They\u2019ve never been inside my anxious brain as it ping-pongs from what to make for dinner to whether I forgot to feed the cat to an awkward thing I said six years ago. But\u2014at least at the beginning\u2014I was committed. Read More: Long Waits, Short Appointments, Huge Bills: U.S. Health Care Is Causing Patient Burnout Socializing at work was by far the easiest part. I found it energizing and soul-nourishing to see co-workers face-to-face, even if we mostly chatted about bad Keurig coffee and reality television. I also felt virtuous about taking leisurely lunch breaks with colleagues. However, adding in a long commute made every other element of my plan harder. Exercising four times a week became a scheduling headache. Meditating and drawing fell even lower down my priority list. Sometimes I listened to a guided meditation during my subway ride home, which was futile. And on more than one occasion, I actually said the words \u201cUgh, I still have to doodle,\u201d out loud to my fianc\u00e9 at the end of the day. Exercise, at least, reliably lifted my mood and eased my stress when I managed to squeeze it in. But meditating often felt more boring than centering, and I frequently stared down at a blank page in my notebook, wondering what the heck my emotions looked like. Katina Bajaj, a clinical psychology researcher who launched a startup aimed at using creativity to bust burnout, was the one who suggested my daily doodling. The instructions she sent recommended starting by \u201cdrawing repetitive lines, dots, shapes or blocks, and notic[ing] how your mind begins to create more space.\u201d I tried\u2014I really did. But doodling and deep breathing didn\u2019t cancel out the drains of deadline pressures, rude emails, and constant bad news. If anything, my regimen made it clear that adding to my to-do list made my stress worse. My experiment had failed. Which brought me to the dance circle at the University of Colorado. The burnout study there had the extreme misfortune of trying to launch in March 2020, just as the U.S. was shutting down. Dr. Marc Moss, a critical-care physician and CORAL\u2019s principal investigator, had intended to study burnout reduction among intensive-care providers. But by the time COVID-19 was controlled enough in Colorado to get the program up and running in -September 2020, \u201cthe whole world was stressed out,\u201d Moss says. He and his colleagues decided to open the first few study sessions to any patient\u2013facing health care workers, then broadened the eligibility criteria over time. Now in its sixth round, CORAL welcomes anyone in the Denver area who works in the health care field, from researchers and lab technicians to food\u2013service workers and case managers. When people sign up for CORAL, they\u2019re assigned to a group focusing on visual arts, writing, dance, or music. For 12 weeks, facilitators use creative exercises to help people express their identity and values, channel negative emotions, build resilience, and develop self-care routines. To build community, participants are also encouraged to share experiences from their lives and jobs and take part in a group project, such as contributing a work of art to an album or performing a dance. \u201cWe\u2019re building resilience more than curing burnout,\u201d says Katherine Reed, an art therapist who runs CORAL\u2019s visual-arts group. But the data suggest one leads to the other: for almost 150 health care providers who joined the study from September 2020 to July 2021, the approach led to small but significant decreases in anxiety, depression, and burnout, according to a 2022 study published in the American Journal of Medicine. If the framework proves effective for people in a wider swath of health care jobs, Moss says CORAL\u2019s approach could feasibly be adopted by burned-out workers in any industry. That\u2019s what made me want to try the program. Burnout has been studied extensively among health care workers, but few researchers have looked at interventions for the general public. During my visit in March, I dropped in on the music, writing, and dance groups. (I missed visual art because of a flight delay, because apparently the universe wanted my baseline state to be as stressed as possible.) For three days, I used all of my senses to describe how humor looks, sounds, feels, smells, and tastes; wrote about my emotions as if they were characters in a short story; and practiced vulnerability by dancing in front of strangers. I listened as members of the study talked about frustrating moments in their days, applauding along with everyone else when people described emotional breakthroughs with their bosses or co-workers. Even as an aggressively uncrafty, professionally skeptical person, I felt calm and happy during my time with CORAL\u2014a combination, probably, of getting away from my daily routine, paying attention to my emotions, and trying something new. I was encouraged. But when I asked Moss and his team if the CORAL curriculum could be distilled into something I, or any individual, could do on my own, I was met with a resounding no. The program\u2019s magic, its facilitators said, is in bringing people together to feel the solidarity and community so often lacking in modern life. People can draw or dance or write or sing on their own, but it likely won\u2019t have the same transformative effect without a human connection. Read More: How to Find Your New Favorite Hobby That\u2019s what Dr. Colin West, who researches physician well-being at the Mayo Clinic, found in 2021, when he published a study on what happened when physicians met up for group discussions over meals. Their burnout symptoms improved, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily the food that made the difference\u2014it was support. \u201cWe have so many shared experiences and so many stressors that are in common, and yet physicians will often feel like, Well, I can\u2019t talk to anybody about this,\u201d West says. Bringing people together to share their experiences can help. West believes there are other reasons the program worked: it was easy for people to join, since they had to eat anyway, and the hospital made meals free for study participants. \u201cThe individual needs to contribute something, and the organization needs to contribute something,\u201d West says. That two-sided approach helps people feel supported and valued by their organization, which can go a long way toward easing some of the bitterness and cynicism that accompany burnout. Since my solo study didn\u2019t work, and I couldn\u2019t take off 12 weeks to join CORAL for real, I felt resigned to the relief I\u2019d gained from exercise and my in-person days at the office. But over time, something changed at work. My editor\u2014tipped off to my burnout when I pitched the story you\u2019re reading\u2014encouraged me to take a step back from the COVID-19 news cycle and pursue other topics. As I settled into my less-COVID-centric routine, it felt easier to get excited about pitching ideas and writing stories, and to show up each day feeling more engaged and energized. In a way, my experiment proved that burnout expert Maslach was right all along: the self-care tactics I used on my own were less effective than workplace adjustments. But after visiting CORAL, I believe the solution to burnout isn\u2019t just to sit back and hope employers make the right changes. Moss, the research lead for CORAL, thinks about it like this: a hospital could make administrative tweaks to lighten doctors\u2019 workloads, but it can\u2019t protect them from the death and sadness they see every day. \u201cWe see things that are not normal, and we see a lot of tragedy,\u201d Moss says. \u201cI can\u2019t work in an intensive-care unit and not have that happen.\u201d The stressors baked into other industries might be different or less intense, but they\u2019re present in some form, no matter the job. Maybe it\u2019s obnoxious customers, or exhausting overnight shifts, or bureaucratic red tape; there\u2019s always something. When done right, interventions like the ones used in CORAL can provide communal outlets for the stressors that won\u2019t ever go away. I\u2019m hoping happier health news lands on my desk soon. But in the meantime, I\u2019m pursuing better ways to manage stress and searching for people willing to join me. So long, solo doodling. I\u2019m thinking of joining a book club instead\u2014or maybe a dance class.",

        "content": "In the days after her husband was reported missing to the Texas Army base where he was stationed, Cam Chamberlain sent a series of urgent Facebook messages to a longtime friend: When he disappeared, she said, he left her with no food and no money. She wasn\u2019t working, she was estranged from her family, and her efforts to get help from the Army had gone nowhere, two longtime friends said.   \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she wrote to Jessica D\u2019Lynn Pyles in a message the friend shared with NBC News. \u201cI\u2019m alone. I just want the pain to go away. I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d Within a week of that message, Cam Chamberlain\u2019s death was announced, and the next day, her husband \u2014 who had been missing for 11 days \u2014 was discovered alive. Spc. Craig Chamberlain, 23, had \u201cwillfully\u201d disappeared from his unit, according to Army officials at his post, Fort Cavazos. Military authorities have offered few answers about what happened, and friends of Cam Chamberlain, who was in her late 20s, have said they\u2019ve found no solace in the aftermath of her death: There have been no autopsy, no obituary and no funeral.  Officials confirmed her death in a statement May 25. The couple lived off base, and a spokeswoman for the Killeen Police Department referred questions about the case to Fort Cavazos authorities, who put out a statement confirming the death. They didn\u2019t provide details about when or where she died, and her cause and manner of death haven\u2019t been disclosed.  Army investigators launched a criminal probe. A spokeswoman for the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division declined to comment further, citing an ongoing investigation. \u201cI can\u2019t even mourn her death the way family should, because it\u2019s as if she never existed at all now,\u201d said Shandy Eubank, one of the longtime friends. The day after authorities announced that his wife had died, Craig Chamberlain was found in \u201crough shape\u201d in the Killeen area, said his mother, Virginia Chamberlain. In an interview with NBC News, she declined to say where her son is now. A spokeswoman at Fort Cavazos declined to discuss his status in the Army, saying he was the subject of an administrative investigation in connection with his disappearance. The inquiry has been completed but can\u2019t be disclosed because of privacy rules. A quick marriage and an overseas assignment Craig and Cam Chamberlain met a few years ago through a dating app and were married in 2020, according to her Facebook page. Though Eubank believed the couple had rushed things, they initially seemed happy, she said. \u201cThe way he treated her \u2014 he put her on a pedestal,\u201d said Eubank, who met Cam when they worked together at an insurance company in Waco more than a decade ago. \u201cHe treated her better than anyone had treated her.\u201d She was a people person, Eubank said \u2014 someone who was as outspoken as she was happy and goofy.   D\u2019Lynn Pyles said, \u201cYou knew where she stood on things.\u201d In an interview with a Texas newspaper, Cam described her husband as laid back, patient and carefree. He has a unicorn tattooed on the upper part of his right arm, his mother said. Craig Chamberlain was assigned to the 704th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company at Fort Cavazos, formerly known as Fort Hood, one of the largest Army bases in the country, which sits roughly midway between Austin and Waco.  A rift emerged between the couple over time, which Cam attributed partly to difficult family dynamics, Eubank said. Cam publicly identified as a transgender woman and had a rocky relationship with her own family, telling friends that her mother had \u201cdisowned\u201d her, Eubank and D\u2019Lynn Pyles recalled. Efforts to reach Cam Chamberlain\u2019s mother were unsuccessful. Messages left at a phone number listed as her brother\u2019s weren\u2019t returned. Cam told Eubank that she struggled with her husband\u2019s family, as well. Eubank remembered her friend recounting a conversation in which her mother-in-law challenged her ability to be in a loving relationship: \u201cHow can she know she loves Craig when she doesn\u2019t know what gender she is?\u201d  Virginia Chamberlain called the comment \u201cvery, very inaccurate.\u201d \u201cDid we have our differences? Absolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will say I never bullied Cam. I never said a statement like that to Cam. Not once did that ever come out of my mouth.\u201d Craig Chamberlain\u2019s father, Gordon Chamberlain, added that although he hadn\u2019t met Cam before his son married her, \u201cI said we\u2019d treat Cam like anyone else that comes into our lives.\u201d The Army was sending Craig to South Korea, and Cam planned to \u201cstick with him,\u201d Eubank said, despite the growing tension between them. Fort Cavazos officials confirmed he had been ordered to South Korea in December for a long-term assignment.  In a Jan. 8 Facebook post, Cam seemed excited about the trip \u2014 and traveling to other parts of Asia. \u201cCan\u2019t wait for the FOOD,\u201d she wrote in a post that D\u2019Lynn Pyles captured in a screenshot and shared with NBC News. \u201cI love real Asian food.\u201d But months passed, and the couple went nowhere. Then, on March 20, she posted that her husband\u2019s orders had been deferred for six months \u2014 and that she learned so only the night before he was to have left. \u201cYou never know what comes next,\u201d she wrote in another post that D\u2019Lynn Pyles shared. \u201cPlans change faster than this Texas weather.\u201d A spokeswoman for Fort Cavazos declined to comment on the deferment, saying it was part of the base\u2019s administrative investigation.  A missing soldier By the time Cam Chamberlain reported her husband missing \u2014 he had last been seen May 15 \u2014 their relationship had become so \u201ctoxic\u201d that she had planned to split up with him, she told D\u2019Lynn Pyles in a Facebook message. \u201cEven though I\u2019m getting divorced I still can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s in danger,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI still love him and I\u2019d blame myself if anything happened to him.\u201d In other messages to D\u2019Lynn Pyles, she pleaded for money. In one message, she said her husband had refused to pay her their Basic Allowance for Housing, or compensation provided to service members and their families who live off base. \"He went missing and left me with no food. No nothing,\" she said in a message. \"His command won\u2019t help me.\" In a statement, officials at Fort Cavazos didn\u2019t address Cam Chamberlain\u2019s claim. They said that \u201ccaring for our soldiers and families is a top priority.\u201d  \u201cIf soldiers and family members have pay issues that cannot be resolved at the unit level, they should seek help from their unit\u2019s personnel office,\u201d the statement said. In another message, Cam shared a missing person flyer for her husband \u2014 a flyer later circulated by local media that said Craig disappeared without his keys and phone. He\u2019d been suffering from a \u201cbout of extreme depression,\u201d the flyer said. As she searched for her husband, she tracked the sometimes grim responses to his disappearance on social media. In a lengthy comment thread on a local station\u2019s Facebook page, people made jokes about how the base\u2019s name change didn\u2019t prevent another soldier from disappearing and casually suggested his wife may have had something to do with it. In response to a user who said she hoped \u201chis wife\u201d didn\u2019t see the comments, Cam responded: \u201cI have seen them. All of them. And I hope that each and every one of them goes through the pain I am going through.\u201d She also began to talk more about her husband\u2019s disappearance. In a message to D\u2019Lynn Pyles, she said her husband had \u201clied\u201d to her about South Korea. She didn\u2019t offer additional details, but in an interview with the Killeen Daily Herald while Craig was missing, she said Army officials had recently told her that he had stopped reporting to work in March. \u201cHe told me he was going to work the whole time, so I didn\u2019t think anything of it, but in reality, he wasn\u2019t really going to work,\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201cHe was just saying he was going to work.\u201d Virginia Chamberlain cast doubt on her daughter-in-law\u2019s account, saying photos from the time show her son with long hair and a scruffy face. \"You can\u2019t report for duty like that in the Army,\" she said. Officials at Fort Cavazos said in a statement that Craig Chamberlain had \u201cfailed\u201d to travel to his new assignment for \u201cunknown reasons.\u201d A spokeswoman for the base declined to comment when she was asked about the accuracy of Cam Chamberlain\u2019s comments. A plea for help The last time D\u2019Lynn Pyles heard from Cam was May 21, when she sent a Facebook message asking for $40. She\u2019d gone to her mother\u2019s house in Fort Worth \u2014 a place where she said she was \u201cno longer welcome\u201d \u2014 and had spent the last of her money on a ride home to Killeen. D\u2019Lynn Pyles said she couldn\u2019t give her the money \u2014 she\u2019d just gone shopping and had $20 to her name, according to a screenshot of the message. \u201cI totally understand,\u201d her friend responded. Four days later, D\u2019Lynn Pyles messaged Cam \u2014 \u201cAre you good?!\u201d \u2014 and then called. There was no response, and D\u2019Lynn Pyles soon found herself on Facebook groups linked to Fort Cavazos searching for answers. The next day, on May 26, Craig Chamberlain was found alive. It was a week and a half after he had been reported missing and not long after a civilian search party set out with his parents to find him.  Virginia Chamberlain said the group \u2014 made up of \u201ccomplete strangers\u201d \u2014 were \u201cwith us every single day looking for our son.\u201d \"And they were there when we found him,\" she said. \"They are now family to us.\" The base offered few specifics about how or where Craig was found. In a statement, military officials accused him of willfully disappearing and said the search involved the \u201ctremendous efforts and support by the Fort Cavazos and Killeen communities.\u201d Virginia Chamberlain also declined to say where her son was found. She described his path forward as a \u201chard journey\u201d with \u201ca lot of healing to take place.\u201d \"This is a very delicate story,\" she added. \"There\u2019s a lot of lives that have been affected by it. My heart truly does break for Cam\u2019s friends and Cam\u2019s family \u2014 even with the things that have gone on in the past.\" For D\u2019Lynn Pyles, Cam\u2019s death was especially hard given that one of the things her friend had wanted most was a committed partner, someone with whom she could establish the kind of family she didn\u2019t have. \"Craig has been the longest relationship she\u2019d had since I\u2019ve known her,\" D\u2019Lynn Pyles said in a text. \"She was longing for THAT kind of love.\" Now, D\u2019Lynn Pyles added, she just wants the truth about Cam \u2014 \"even if it breaks my heart.\"",

        "title": "Appeals court pauses order limiting Biden admin social media contact",
        "content": "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 A federal appeals court Friday temporarily paused a lower court\u2019s order limiting executive branch officials\u2019 communications with social media companies about controversial online posts. Biden administration lawyers had asked the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to stay the preliminary injunction issued on July 4 by U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty. Doughty himself had rejected a request to put his order on hold pending appeal. Friday\u2019s brief 5th Circuit order put Doughty\u2019s injunction on hold \u201cuntil further orders of the court.\u201d It called for arguments in the case to be scheduled on an expedited basis. Filed last year, the lawsuit claimed the administration, in effect, censored free speech by discussing possible regulatory action the government could take while pressuring companies to remove what it deemed misinformation. COVID-19 vaccines, legal issues involving President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter and election fraud allegations were among the topics spotlighted in the lawsuit. Doughty, nominated to the federal bench by former President Donald Trump, issued an Independence Day order and accompanying reasons that covered more than 160 pages. He said the plaintiffs were likely to win their ongoing lawsuit. His injunction blocked the Department of Health and Human Services, the FBI and multiple other government agencies and administration officials from \u201cencouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech.\u201d Administration lawyers said the order was overly broad and vague, raising questions about what officials can say in conversations with social media companies or in public statements. They said Doughty\u2019s order posed a threat of \u201cgrave\u201d public harm by chilling executive branch efforts to combat online misinformation. Doughty rejected the administration\u2019s request for a stay on Monday, writing: \u201cDefendants argue that the injunction should be stayed because it might interfere with the Government\u2019s ability to continue working with social-media companies to censor Americans\u2019 core political speech on the basis of viewpoint. In other words, the Government seeks a stay of the injunction so that it can continue violating the First Amendment.\u201d In its request that the 5th Circuit issue a stay, administration lawyers said there has been no evidence of threats by the administration. \u201cThe district court identified no evidence suggesting that a threat accompanied any request for the removal of content. Indeed, the order denying the stay \u2014 presumably highlighting the ostensibly strongest evidence \u2014 referred to \u2018a series of public media statements,\u2019\u201d the administration said. Friday\u2019s \u201cadministrative stay\u201d was issued without comment by a panel of three 5th Circuit judges: Carl Stewart, nominated to the court by former President Bill Clinton; James Graves, nominated by former President Barack Obama; and Andrew Oldham, nominated by Trump. A different panel drawn from the court, which has 17 active members, will hear arguments on a longer stay.",

        "content": "A Texas soldier who disappeared for 11 days this year \u2014 and was found one day after the announcement of his wife\u2019s death \u2014 is not a person of interest in the case, military officials said. In a news release, the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division cleared Spc. Craig Chamberlain, 23, in the May death of Cam Chamberlain and said her cause and manner of death will be released after an autopsy is completed. The statement, which was released Friday, added that because the investigation is active, no additional details will be released. In a text message Monday, Craig Chamberlain's mother disputed the date of death the Army released for Cam Chamberlain \u2014 May 25 \u2014 and said the Criminal Investigation Division previously told her family it was May 23. An Army spokeswoman could not immediately clarify the discrepancy. Fort Cavazos officials announced the death on May 25. \"I am glad that the truth is coming out and I know that there will be more truth to follow,\" Virginia Chamberlain said in the text. \"We do not know why it has taken so long for this to come to light.\" She called on the Killeen Police Department to release the details surrounding her daughter-in-law's death so \"Cam's loved ones and friends can have closure.\" The police department previously referred questions to the lead agency investigating her death, the Criminal Investigation Division. NBC News reported Thursday that close friends of Cam Chamberlain\u2019s have remained frustrated in the weeks after her death because authorities have released few details about it. \u201cI can\u2019t even mourn her death the way family should, because it\u2019s as if she never existed at all now,\u201d said a friend, Shandy Eubank. Efforts to reach Cam Chamberlain's family have been unsuccessful. Friends of hers have said she was estranged from relatives. Craig Chamberlain, of Fort Cavazos\u2019 704th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company, went missing May 15 in what the Army described as a \"willful\" disappearance. The base has said he was found May 26. Army officials have declined to provide more details about his status or the disappearance, which was the subject of internal inquiry. A spokeswoman for the base said the Army does not comment on administrative actions. Craig Chamberlain\u2019s mother previously said a civilian search party found him in the Killeen area \u2014 near where Fort Cavazos is located \u2014 in \"rough shape.\" She declined to provide additional details, citing his privacy, but she described his path forward as a \"hard journey\" with \"a lot of healing.\" Craig and Cam Chamberlain were married in October 2020. He was assigned to a new post in South Korea in December, Army officials have said, but for \u201cunknown reasons\u201d he never traveled to the country. In a Facebook message to a friend after Craig Chamberlain went missing, Cam Chamberlain said her husband had lied to her about the assignment, and in an interview with the Killeen Daily Herald she said military officials told her that he stopped reporting to work in March \u2014 though she said he never told her about it. In the days before her death, Cam Chamberlain told friends that her marriage had become \"toxic\" and that she was divorcing her husband.  Eubank said her friend had struggled with her husband and his family partly because of her gender identity. Cam Chamberlain publicly identified as a transgender woman. Virginia Chamberlain has rejected that claim, calling it \u201cvery, very inaccurate.\u201d ",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Kerry Kennedy, a sister of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., lambasted her brother in a brief statement Monday after a report quoted him as saying that Covid-19 was \"targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people\" and that Jewish people are most immune. \"I strongly condemn my brother\u2019s deplorable and untruthful remarks last week about Covid being engineered for ethnic targeting,\" Kerry Kennedy said in a statement released by the nonprofit group Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, where she is president. \"His statements do not represent what I believe or what Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights stand for, with our 50+-year track record of protecting rights and standing against racism and all forms of discrimination,\" she added. On Saturday, the New York Post published an article that included a video that appeared to show Robert Kennedy speaking at a dinner in Manhattan about bioweapons and \"ethnically targeted microbes\" in which he claimed that \"Covid-19 attacks certain races disproportionately.\" \"Covid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese,\" he said, according to the video published by the Post. \"We don\u2019t know whether it was deliberately targeted that or not.\" An overwhelming proportion of American Jews are Ashkenazi Jews, who are descended from Jews who lived in Central and Eastern Europe. NBC News has not verified the video. In a statement on Twitter later in the day, Kennedy defended his remarks, saying they were not antisemitic. Former Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., also weighed in Monday, tweeting that he condemns his uncle's remarks. Robert Kennedy has been repeatedly criticized for pushing conspiracy theories, some about vaccines. Kerry Kennedy, 63, his sister, also blasted her brother, 69, when he launched his presidential bid in April. \"I love my brother Bobby, but I do not share or endorse his opinions on many issues, including the COVID pandemic, vaccinations, and the role of social media platforms in policing false information,\" she said at the time. \"It is also important to note that Bobby\u2019s views are not reflected in or influence the mission or work of our organization.\" Other members of their family have also rebuked him over the conspiracy theories about vaccines and misinformation he has spread for years. At the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denounced the remarks Monday. \"The claims made on that tape is false. It is vile,\" she said at the daily briefing. \"They put our fellow Americans in danger if you think about the racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories that come out of saying those types of things. It's an attack on our fellow citizens, our fellow Americans. So it's important that we speak out.\"",

        "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Five major U.S. cities and the  The All Inside initiative will partner the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness and its 19 federal member agencies with state officials in California and local governments in Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Seattle and the Phoenix metro area. The goal is for the federal government to provide \u201cknowledge, resources and elbow grease\u201d to population centers where nearly half the nation\u2019s unhoused residents live, said Susan Rice, President Joe Biden\u2019s domestic policy advisor. The administration will offer \u201ctailored support\u201d for two years to improve efforts toward housing unsheltered people in the participating communities, including embedding a federal official in each area, officials said. In addition, teams will be deployed to help the communities obtain federal funding, establish a network of resources and identify areas where regulations can be loosened and the process for securing housing can be sped up. Philanthropic groups and private businesses will be invited to help identify opportunities for support and collaboration, according to the administration. More than\u00a0580,000 Americans\u00a0were homeless in 2022, with 4 out of 10 of them unsheltered and sleeping on sidewalks and in tents and cars, Rice said. \u201cWe know we cannot meaningfully address our nation\u2019s homelessness problem without a distinct focus on unsheltered homelessness,\u201d she said during a livestreamed announcement with the cities\u2019 mayors and other officials. Agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Social Security Agency, Department of Labor, Federal Emergency Management Agency, will be involved under Thursday\u2019s announcement to help coordinate housing opportunities. Funding specifics were not offered, but the White House said the program will build on the $2.5 billion already allocated to prevent homelessness under the administration\u2019s American Rescue Plan and $486 million in the Department of Housing and Urban Development funding released to local municipalities earlier this year. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass\u00a0said she hoped the initiative would unstick the current bottleneck plaguing her program Inside Safe, which offers homeless people motel rooms and a path to permanent housing with services. The City Council on Thursday passed the mayor\u2019s budget, which provides $250 million for the LA initiative. It has over 1,200 enrollees so far but is moving slowly because of bureaucratic red tape. \u201cIf anything, we know that our current system on the federal, state and county level isn\u2019t designed for the emergency that we are facing today,\u201d Bass, a Democrat, said. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said the White House plan will \u201cunite our systems,\u201d bringing solutions that are effective in some cities to other areas. \u201cWhat\u2019s working in one city will work here because we\u2019re dealing with the same American issues,\u201d Harrell, a Democrat, said. The Seattle area had the nation\u2019s third highest population of homeless residents in 2022, after Los Angeles and New York, at more than 13,300, according to a one-night count required by the federal government. Seattle, King County and nearby cities joined together to launch a regional homelessness authority two years ago. But many officials say the new agency has underperformed, been beset by political fights and had trouble fulfilling administrative duties such as executing contracts with service providers.

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A brewing battle over how to fund the federal government is poised to escalate this week when Congress returns from a two-week recess. The House Republican majority is on a collision course with the Senate as appropriators in both chambers advance conflicting versions of a sweeping package, which must become law by Sept. 30 to prevent a government shutdown. Unlike the House, Senate leaders have moved on a bipartisan path and key senators say they intend to reassert themselves after taking a back seat in the recent debt ceiling negotiations. Yet  Seeking to  Democrats have blasted that as a breach of the agreement. \u201cWhat Speaker McCarthy is doing is increasing the risks of a government shutdown,\u201d said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is charged with writing government funding bills along with its House counterpart. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s a violation of the agreement that Speaker McCarthy struck with the president,\u201d said Van Hollen, who accused McCarthy of \u201ccatering to his very far right\u201d members. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly going to make for some rocky moments.\u201d Top House Republicans, who voted a series of appropriations bills out of committee before the July 4 recess, say they want to redefine how spending agreements are perceived.\u00a0 Granger called the debt ceiling budget agreement \u201ca ceiling, not a floor\u201d for the next round of government funding. \u201cThat is why I will use this opportunity to mark up appropriations bills\" at the lower level that was established in fiscal year 2022. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said House conservatives are trying to right the perceived wrongs of the debt limit battle, including funding levels they believe were too high. \u201cWe have major disagreements with both how, and what, occurred with respect to the debt ceiling increase. So now we\u2019re trying to put the band back together again,\u201d said Roy. In addition to policies going after abortion and LGBTQ rights, House Democrats have criticized other measures that Republicans added to their appropriations bills, including cuts to rural energy funding, a prohibition on military diversity programs and repeal of clean-energy tax breaks under the Inflation Reduction Act. It remains to be seen how firmly McCarthy will insist on the lower spending levels and conservative policy add-ons. Some in the House GOP see it as a first bite at the apple before negotiations with the Senate begin in earnest. Looming over McCarthy is the need to keep his thin majority unified in order to protect his speakership, with ultraconservatives tending to drive the hardest bargain. While House Republicans battle with Democrats, the Senate is taking a different approach in marking legislation at the agreed-to caps and avoiding policies that are poison pills for either party. \u201cIn the Senate, we are working diligently through regular order on a bipartisan basis to advance appropriations bills,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote to colleagues in a Sunday letter outlining a busy July schedule. Senate Appropriations Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Vice Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, issued a joint statement vowing to move \u201cfull steam ahead and in a bipartisan way.\u201d They also vowed to assert the Senate's power, a signal that the funding debate will play out differently than the debt limit bill. \u201cWe are both committed to ensuring that the voice of the Senate is heard through the appropriations process and expect a busy summer of markups and continued bipartisan deliberation,\u201d Murray and Collins said. Murray made it clear the GOP push to fund the military at a higher level while slashing domestic funding was a nonstarter for the Senate. \u201cAs this process continues to move forward, I am going to insist that the programs families depend on every day get the same kind of attention and urgency we constantly see for the Pentagon,\u201d she said at a recent committee meeting when members unanimously approved measures for the military, veterans, agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. McCarthy is  Meeting with service members at Fort Knox last Wednesday, McConnell said the cause represents \u201cthe most important thing going on in the world right now, which is to defeat the Russians in Ukraine.\u201d He said that while some believe the war is not important for the U.S., \u201cthat\u2019s not my view\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cnot the majority view of Republicans in the Senate and Democrats as well.\u201d It will be a busy September, with Congress also facing Sept. 30 deadlines to agree on a new farm bill and reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. And the tensions over funding the government could chill the climate for negotiations. \u201cThey\u2019re reneging on what they negotiated,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said of House Republicans. \u201cWhy negotiate with people if they\u2019re not going to stand by what they\u2019ve negotiated?\u201d",

        "content": "The couple who called in  Michael Charles Burham, 34, was taken into custody by 5:50 p.m. Saturday in Warren County after a weeklong manhunt, Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police said. Cindy and Ron Ecklund led authorities to Burham after their dog's barking alerted them to his presence.  Ron Ecklund said he got into a golf cart and drove down to the creek near their property to investigate.  \"Gentleman stands up and I asked him, 'So, what are you doing?'\" Ecklund told NBC News correspondent George Solis. \"He said, 'I'm camping.'\" Ecklund told his wife, who was outside the golf cart, to get back in the cart so they could return to the house.  \"We weren't halfway up the yard and I'm like: 'Dial 911. I know exactly who that is,'\" he said. \"I've seen his picture enough. He's been all over the news.\"  The couple believe they might be eligible for the reward authorities offered for information about Burham's whereabouts, which had increased to $22,000 by Friday.  Burham escaped from the Warren County Jail on July 7 by climbing through the metal grates of the jail yard\u2019s roof. He then climbed down using tied-together bedsheets, authorities said. Authorities described him as someone with \"survivalist skills\" who was comfortable in woods for long periods of time. At least 15 federal and local departments had been searching the area for him for eight days.  He was taken into custody at gunpoint and will be arraigned on an escape charge, Bivens said. Burham was being held in the county on kidnapping and other related charges. He is accused of having kidnapped a Warren County couple while on the run from authorities in New York, where he is a suspect in the May 11 murder of Kala Hodgkin. Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said last month that there were no state charges against Burham in the murder case. He was charged with flight to avoid prosecution in U.S. District Court for Western New York in May. The case was dismissed without prejudice on June 16, according to court records. A federal criminal complaint says Hodgkin was found fatally shot at her home. At the time of the killing, there was an active arrest warrant charging Burham with raping her, according to the complaint. While police were on their way to Hodgkin\u2019s home, a separate call came in that Burham had allegedly tried to break into an ex-girlfriend\u2019s home and then set her car on fire, the complaint says. Burham went on the run, leading authorities on a multistate manhunt before he was captured May 24 in South Carolina, the Jamestown Police Department in New York said. The complaint said Burham kidnapped a couple at gunpoint at their Sheffield, Pennsylvania, home while on the run. They were found alive in a cemetery in North Charleston, South Carolina. A note in their vehicle allegedly written by Burham told his father he was \u201csafe for now\u201d and apologized \u201cfor all the problems I caused the family,\u201d the complaint says.\u00a0",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 No Labels is facing increasing scrutiny over the possibility it could play a spoiler role in the 2024 presidential election, and its founder and CEO said in an exclusive interview that she vows to end the group\u2019s third-party 2024 effort if it risks putting Donald Trump back in the White House. But Nancy Jacobson repeatedly declined to offer any metric on how the group would determine whether to stand down. \u201cAs a Democrat? Categorically, that will not happen,\u201d Jacobson said in response to a question about concerns that a third-party ticket, running on the ballot line No Labels is seeking in every state, could siphon off votes from President Joe Biden and benefit Trump. \u201cThis effort will nev \u2014 we\u2019ll pull it down.\u201d Jacobson immediately added: \u201cWe will not spoil for either side. The only reason to do this is to win.\u201d It\u2019s a bold statement in a nation where the most successful third-party presidential effort in the last century finished a distant third. And even as the No Labels effort stepped out this week with a public campaign-style event in Manchester, New Hampshire, much of its political effort remains secret. The group doesn\u2019t reveal its donors and isn\u2019t publicly discussing its deliberations over whom it may recruit to run on its planned bipartisan ticket. The details of how it\u2019ll operate its convention in Dallas in April also aren\u2019t clear, though the group has no plans to hold traditional primaries or caucuses in which voters select a presidential nominee. Jacobson said the group will assess its standing after Super Tuesday and the Florida primary next year. Jacobson worked as a major fundraiser for the Clintons and the Democratic Party before she formed No Labels in 2010, helped create the congressional Problem Solvers Caucus and aided moderate members of Congress from both parties in their elections. Jacobson, a Democrat, demurred when she was asked whether Biden represented the bipartisan leader No Labels has hinged its efforts on. Biden ran his 2020 presidential campaign on the promise to work with congressional Republicans. His campaign has often pointed to the passage of the CHIPS Act, the infrastructure package and the debt ceiling deal \u2014 deals celebrated by No Labels\u2019 allies in Congress \u2014 as evidence of the president\u2019s work. \u201cJoe Biden is a good man. There has been a lot of tremendous legislation, but the point is it\u2019s about the voters. It\u2019s not about us,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the voters, and the voters of this country right now are not saying they want him as a choice \u2014 right now.\u201d Aspects of current polling are grim for Biden. Though he retained a slight lead against Trump in the most recent NBC News national poll, his approval rating stood at 43%. And 44% of voters, including a larger share of Democrats than Republicans, say they\u2019re open to considering a third-party candidate. It\u2019s against that backdrop that national Democrats have expressed deep concern about the consequences of No Labels\u2019 presidential efforts. \u201cI don\u2019t think No Labels is a political party,\u201d Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz.,  Jacobson said the group wouldn\u2019t disclose its donors, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing nefarious going on here.\u201d She said the group isn\u2019t legally obligated to reveal its financial sources. The Arizona Democratic Party  Even though it registered as a political party, Jacobson denied the group \u2014 which is incorporated as a so-called social welfare nonprofit organization \u2014 is acting in the capacity of a party, arguing that it will only make its ballot line available for a presidential ticket, not actually operate the eventual campaign.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s just language,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cThat\u2019s not \u2014 you know, we are not functioning \u2014 we are one ticket, one time. \u201cA party \u2014 [the] definition of a party is running candidates up and down the ballot. That is not what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she continued. Some Biden allies, seeing No Labels as a clear potential spoiler, have questioned the true motivations behind Jacobson\u2019s mission. But one of her longtime senior advisers, William Galston, who left the organization in April over his opposition to the presidential ticket operation, defended her intentions in an interview. \u201cI do not question the motives or the patriotism or the integrity of anybody involved in this effort,\u201d Galston said. \u201cMy opposition is a simple matter of political analysis. I believe there is a gap between what No Labels wants to do and what its efforts will, in fact, achieve.\u201d Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, helped Jacobson start No Labels in 2010 but left the organization in April over his opposition to the presidential ticket operation.\u00a0 \u201cI cannot see a serious possibility that an independent, bipartisan, centrist, third-party ticket can succeed and win the presidency,\u201d said Galston, adding: \u201cI fear that despite its intentions to the contrary, if it proceeds, it will end up \u2014 it will end up helping Donald Trump.\u201d According to the NBC News exit poll, most of those who voted third-party in 2016 decided to back Biden four years later, helping deny Trump re-election. Now, Democrats worry that a growing third-party vote in 2024 would lower the threshold Trump needs to win again \u2014 as it did in 2016, when 47% to 48% of the vote was enough for him to capture key swing states. Jacobson defended the organization\u2019s credibility in her interview, citing the numerous nationally recognized figures affiliated with it. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve been around for 13 years. They can see the leaders around this,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cThey can see Sen. Joe Lieberman. They can see Gov. Larry Hogan. They can see a civil rights leader, Ben Chavis. They can see all the leaders. They can see our work for the last 13 years.\u201d Monday in New Hampshire, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Jon Huntsman, the Republican former governor of Utah and ambassador to China, headlined No Labels\u2019 \u201cCommon Sense Town Hall\u201d at Saint Anselm College. Manchin  \u201cLet\u2019s see where everybody goes. Let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d Manchin said.\u00a0 Last week, businessman Mark Cuban  \u201cI like that they are trying a new path.

Gov. Kay Ivey temporarily suspended\u00a0executions\u00a0last year after two lethal injections were\u00a0called off\u00a0because of difficulties inserting an IV into the veins of the condemned men. Advocacy groups claimed a\u00a0third execution\u00a0that was carried out after a lengthy delay was\u00a0botched. A panel of judges with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Monday but did not indicate when they will rule. \u201cWe\u2019re able to see from what happened last year; we have a very strong chance of substantial harm,\u201d Barber attorney Mara Klebaner told the panel. Richard Anderson, an assistant Alabama attorney general, told the court that the state will use a new IV team. He argued that shows a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to correct any problems that had occurred. He said the state submitted documentation showing the people responsible for setting IV lines are appropriately licensed. Klebaner argued the state\u2019s decision to pick a different IV team does not solve the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s like picking up a different can of soda off the shelf from a factory that isn\u2019t passing safety inspections,\u201d she said. After the internal review, Alabama also did away with its customary midnight deadline to get an execution underway in order to give the state more time to establish an intravenous line and battle last-minute legal appeals. The state will have until 6 a.m. Friday morning to get Barber\u2019s execution started. Barber was convicted of the 2001 beating death of 75-year-old Dorothy Epps. Prosecutors said Barber, a handyman who knew Epps\u2019 daughter, confessed to killing Epps with a claw hammer and fleeing with her purse.

David Joyce, R-Ohio, an Appropriations Committee member and the chair of the center-right Republican Governance Group, said that if hard-right members aren\u2019t realistic, the GOP majority will have to deal with House Democrats instead in the lead-up to the Sept. 30 funding deadline. \u201cI understand and appreciate their tactics. That makes for good sound bites or potential for their media saying they\u2019re the only ones who want to stand up and stop the spending. We\u2019re all conservative, but there\u2019s a majority of us who want to see this country work,\u201d Joyce said in an interview. \u201cWe can work together as Republicans, or we can work together with the Democrats.\u201d Joyce added that overly aggressive tactics could lead the GOP-controlled House to fail to pass its opening bid and instead empower Democrats. \u201cOur failure to act does strengthen the hand of the Senate and the office of the president,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to shut down the country over this?

Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma, a co-chair of the Republican Main Street Caucus, said some of the 21 signers of the letter to McCarthy are shifting their demands after they initially insisted that bills move organically through committee. \u201cThose folks that have signed that letter are now moving the goalposts a little bit,\u201d Bice said in a brief interview. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s frustrating for a lot of us.\u201d In their letter to McCarthy, ultraconservatives also insisted that \u201crescissions\u201d of unspent money can\u2019t count toward their insistence that funding revert to fiscal 2022 levels. It\u2019s a familiar struggle for centrist Republicans, who are often agitated by the tactics of their far-right colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus yet struggle to stop them. Last week, a similar group stiff-armed McCarthy into adding divisive amendments to the annual defense policy bill, including abortion and transgender provisions, making the typically bipartisan measure partisan and setting up a fight with Democrats. Implied in the new pushback from GOP centrists is the threat to vote down funding bills that cater too much to the far right. But the right flank doesn\u2019t take such threats seriously, believing instead that its center-right colleagues will ultimately cave to its wishes. \u201cIf you\u2019re a moderate, you pull the gun out and you never expect to have to fire it. Whereas if you\u2019re a conservative and you pull a gun out, you\u2019re ready to pull the trigger,\u201d said a House Republican staffer, who requested anonymity to describe the internal dynamic. Along the way, some Republicans fear, loading up government funding legislation with unpopular provisions \u2014 like steeply cutting rural energy programs, defunding federal law enforcement or adding anti-abortion measures \u2014 could cost politically vulnerable Republicans re-election in 2024, with Democrats salivating at the idea of weaponizing their votes. Some Republicans say the House will end up reverting to funding levels in the debt limit law, even though McCarthy has greenlighted the far-right demands to pass an initial bill with less spending before negotiations with the Democratic-led Senate and President Joe Biden. \u201cWhat happens is we go a little to the right on these votes, and by the time we negotiate with the Senate and the president, we\u2019re back with the debt ceiling agreement,\u201d said Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents an Omaha-based district that Biden won in 2020. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking back to the debt ceiling agreement, I believe, by the time we\u2019re done. \u201cAnd then they\u2019ll be all mad,\u201d Bacon added. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., the other co-chair of the Main Street Caucus, said the intra-party disagreement is primarily over tactics. \u201cIt may be that when the rubber hits the road, there\u2019s increased tension. But a lot of Republicans want to spend less money,\u201d Johnson said, adding that some in the conference don\u2019t have to vote for the bipartisan final funding deal. \u201cCoalitions on final passage don\u2019t have to look the same as coalitions for initial passage.\u201d Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., one of the 21 signers of last week's letter, said conservatives aren\u2019t worried about the more moderate GOP lawmakers\u2019 voting down a bill that leans too far to the right. \u201cIf they do, then it is what it is,\u201d Norman said with a shrug. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing what\u2019s good for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not happy with the debt ceiling deal. \u2026 The only leverage we have now is the appropriations.\u201d A sticking point for the right is that it views certain provisions in appropriations bills as accounting gimmicks, which could prove problematic to meeting the targets in a way 218 Republicans can rally around. \u201cI\u2019m very pro-rescissions. I\u2019m just not pro-rescissions\u2019 being used to backfill or elevate the overall spending for the agency,\u201d said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas. \u201cThat is what is happening now. ... So that\u2019s where the debate lies on the appropriations.\u201d Asked about the prospects of a shutdown on Oct. 1 if Congress fails to reach a deal, Roy said that was up to Biden. \u201cThat depends on whether the administration wants to work with us to change policies that need to be changed,\u201d he said, adding that the House Republicans must use the \u201cpower of the purse\u201d to fight for their values. \u201cYou got to force the hand of the administration. We\u2019re moving the needle.\u201d",

RIA and TASS news agencies quoted Rudenko as saying that Russia\u2019s defence ministry was investigating, but \u201cso far we have no clear information that the missile fell in Russia\u2019s economic zone.\u201d The Hwasong-18 missile is the core of North Korea\u2019s nuclear strike force and the test-fire was a \u201cstrong practical warning\u201d to the United States and other adversaries, the country\u2019s state media said in reporting the launch. The test was condemned by the United States, South Korea and Japan, but Russia\u2019s Rudenko said it was a reaction to actions by Washington and its allies which \u201cactually provoke North Korea to build up its defence power.\u201d North Korea has been under United Nations sanctions for its missile and nuclear programmes since 2006 but the U.N. Security Council has been divided for the past several years on how to deal with it. Russia and China, which both wield veto powers on the council, have said more sanctions will not help and want such measures to be eased. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Khaled Khiari said on Thursday that the latest North Korean missile flight lasted about 74 minutes and travelled over 625 miles. Khiari said it crashed into the sea within Russia\u2019s exclusive economic zone but close to Japanese waters.",

        "title": "U.S. nuclear-armed submarine visits South Korea as allies talk war planning",
        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For the first time since the 1980s, a U.S. nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) visited South Korea on Tuesday, as the allies began talks to coordinate their responses in the event of a nuclear war with North Korea. White House Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell confirmed the rare visit, which had been expected after it was announced in a joint declaration during a summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and President Joe Biden in Washington in April. \u201cAs we speak, an American nuclear submarine is making port in Busan today. That\u2019s the first visit of (an) American nuclear submarine in decades,\u201d Campbell told reporters at a briefing in Seoul, where he was attending the first Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) discussion with South Korean officials. The group, aimed at better coordinating an allied nuclear response in the event of a war with North Korea, was also announced during the April summit amid growing calls in South Korea for its own nuclear weapons, a step Washington opposes. North Korea, which test fired an intercontinental ballistic missile last week, condemned the NCG on Monday for \u201copenly discussing the use of nukes\u201d and warned against allied plans to increase displays of military force, including the submarine visit. Campbell did not identify the submarine, but said its visit is a manifestation of American commitment to South Korea\u2019s defense. South Korea\u2019s defense ministry later confirmed the submarine\u2019s arrival and identified it as the USS Kentucky, an Ohio-class SSBN. U.S. SSBNs rely on stealth to ensure their survival and preserve their ability to launch nuclear missiles during a war, and they rarely make public stops in foreign ports. The United States has pledged to deploy more strategic assets such as aircraft carriers, submarines and long-range bombers to South Korea to deter North Korea, which has developed increasingly powerful missiles that can hit targets as far away as the United States. The U.S. Navy fields 14 SSBNs, often referred to as \u201cboomers.\u201d The Ohio-class submarines carry 20 Trident II D5 missiles, each of which can deliver up to eight nuclear warheads to targets as far as 7,500 miles away. There were regular SSBN visits to South Korea in the 1970s, another period when South Korea was debating the strength of the U.S. commitment and the need for its own nuclear arsenal, according to a report by the Federation of American Scientists. South Korea\u2019s Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Kim Tae-hyo, who co-chaired the meeting, said the discussions are enough to ensure there is no need for South Korea to develop its own nuclear weapons. The two sides agreed to facilitate information sharing \u2014 including establishing a secure communication network \u2014 and coordination and planning in the event of a North Korean nuclear attack, which would face an \u201coverwhelming\u201d allied response, Kim said. The allies will also develop \u201coperations, exercises, simulations, trainings, and investment activities\u201d to bolster nuclear deterrence and response capabilities on the Korean Peninsula, according to a statement released after the meeting. Yoon, the South Korean president, said the NCG would be a \u201cstarting point\u201d to build a strong and effective deterrence against North Korea. \u201cThrough a South Korea-U.S. alliance upgraded to a new nuclear-based paradigm, we will make substantial efforts to fundamentally block North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threats,\u201d he told a briefing. China and North Korea have criticized the group\u2019s formation as further raising tensions on the Korean Peninsula.",
