        "title": "Jack Smith: The special counsel investigating Donald Trump",
        "content": "He is currently overseeing two separate criminal investigations into a former American president, but Jack Smith is no stranger to bringing high-stakes cases. Over the past two decades, Mr Smith, 54, has pursued public officials in the US and abroad - with a mixed record of success. The veteran prosecutor has cut a low profile since his appointment as special counsel in the two investigations of Donald Trump by the US Department of Justice. In announcing his selection last November, Attorney General Merrick Garland called him \"the right choice to complete these matters in an even-handed and urgent manner\". Mr Trump meanwhile has characterised Mr Smith as a \"deranged\" man at the forefront of a \"political witch hunt\" against him. The special counsel has now indicted the ex-president on 40 felony counts over his alleged mishandling of classified documents. He is also expected to charge Mr Trump separately over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Much like the man he is now investigating, John Luman Smith is a New York native. A Harvard Law School graduate, he began his prosecutorial career in 1994 as an assistant district attorney in the Manhattan district attorney's office. Over the next decade, he climbed up the ranks of the US attorney's office in Brooklyn, where he pursued violent gangs, white-collar fraudsters and public corruption cases. He once spent a weekend sleeping in the hallway of an apartment building so he could convince a woman to take the witness stand in a domestic violence case, the Associated Press (AP) reported. During that time, Mr Smith was also among those who investigated the infamous assault of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima with a broomstick by New York police. His work on the team led in part to his recommendation as special counsel in the Trump cases, according to the New York Times. In 2008, Mr Smith went overseas to The Hague in the Netherlands where he oversaw war crimes investigations as a junior investigator for the International Criminal Court. He returned to the Justice Department two years later as chief of the Justice Department's public integrity unit, which prosecutes federal crimes such as public bribery and election fraud. In a 2010 AP interview, he described the career transition as leaving \"the dream job for a better one\". But when he took over, the unit was recovering from a prosecutorial debacle that had seen a banner criminal conviction tossed out by a judge. Mr Smith's stint began with the closure of some long-running investigations into members of Congress without charges, but he pressed ahead with other efforts. Under his tenure, prosecutors brought a public corruption case against former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, a Republican, in a case unanimously overturned by the US Supreme Court in 2016. The unit also prosecuted former Democratic vice-presidential nominee John Edwards, but a jury acquitted Mr Edwards on one count and was deadlocked on others, and he was never tried again. Mr Trump has seized on these examples to argue Mr Smith has \"destroyed a lot of lives\", while also skewering him over his involvement in a tax scandal over the alleged targeting of conservative groups. \"What he's done is just horrible,\" the ex-president told Breitbart on Thursday. \"The abuse of power - it is prosecutorial misconduct.\" Mr Smith has also had many notable victories, including sending former New York state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver to prison on corruption charges. He also convicted ex-Arizona congressman Rick Renzi, a Republican, of corruption. Mr Renzi later received a presidential pardon from Mr Trump. In 2015, Mr Smith accepted a post with the federal prosecutor's office in Nashville, Tennessee, so he could be closer to family. He left in 2017 for a private health care company after being passed over for a permanent appointment under the Trump administration. By 2018, he was back at The Hague where he took up a post as the court's chief prosecutor of war crime allegations in the 1990s Kosovo conflict. When Mr Garland offered Mr Smith the job of special counsel in Washington, his team was preparing for the trial of Kosovo's former president Hashim Thaci, the Times reported. Though eager to return to the Justice Department, Mr Smith was at the time recovering from surgery to his left leg after a bicycle accident and did not return to the US until January 2021. It is at least the second major injury he has suffered while cycling. In the 2000s, he fractured his pelvis after being struck by a truck, an incident which he claimed in an interview has led to multiple physical therapy visits. As avid a runner as he is a cyclist, Mr Smith has completed more than 100 triathlons since 2002, even representing Team USA in World Triathlon. His friend and former colleague, New York attorney Moe Fodeman, described Mr Smith to CNN last year as a \"literally insane\" triathlete and \"one of the best trial lawyers I have ever seen\". Other former co-workers have spoken of Mr Smith's fearless and proactive manner, and many say that Mr Trump's efforts to malign him will come up empty. \"If I were the sort of person who could be cowed -\u0097 'I know we should bring this case, I know the person did it, but we could lose, and that will look bad' - I would find another line of work,\" Mr Smith said in a 2010 interview with the Times. \"I can't imagine how someone who does what I do or has worked with me could think that.\"",

        "title": "Sudan conflict: Women tell BBC horror stories of rape",
        "content": "While Kolthom was being gang-raped by four paramilitary fighters in Sudan's war-hit Darfur region, she was also being racially abused. Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing. \"They were very barbaric. They took turns raping me under the tree where I had gone to gather wood to [make a fire to] keep warm,\" she said in a quivering voice, down the phone line. We have changed her name and that of another rape survivor quoted in this article. Kolthoum, who is in her 40s, is from West Darfur's black African Masalit community, while her rapists were Arabs from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This paramilitary group is accused of carrying out many atrocities in a conflict that has increasingly assumed racial and ethnic overtones in Darfur. Kolthoum lived in El Geneina - historically a symbol of black African power in Darfur, and the traditional capital of the Masalit kingdom. She has now fled with her ill husband and children. Kolthoum says her rapists told her to leave the city as it \"belongs to the Arabs\", fuelling the fears of many black Africans that the RSF - along with allied militias known as the Janjaweed - want to turn the ethnically mixed region into an Arab-ruled domain. Sudan plunged into a civil war in mid-April, after its two most powerful generals - army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as \"Hemedti\" - fell out. Their feud has reignited the conflict in Darfur, which first broke out in 2003, causing the deaths of an estimated 300,000 people in the region. The latest conflict has forced more than 160,000 people, mostly from the Massalit community to flee to Chad. It is unclear how many people have been killed in the region, with the lowest estimate of the death toll in El Geneina put at 5,000. RSF fighters have also been accused of carrying out atrocities in Sudan's most populous state - Khartoum, home to the capital city. The paramilitaries control much of the state, with the army failing to push them back. The fighting has led to an exodus of close to two million people since mid-April. In Khartoum, the violence has not taken a racial or ethnic dimension. Arabs and people of other ethnicities are victims of the ongoing battles. Ibtissam, 24, told the BBC she was on her way to visit her aunt when three RSF soldiers stopped her. \"They pulled their guns at me and asked me where I was going. When I told them that I was going to my aunt's house, they accused me of belonging to the army's intelligence services,\" she told me, her voice breaking. The soldiers then forced her to accompany them in their car and took her into a nearby house. \"I saw another man inside the house, stripped to his underwear. I tried to run away. But one of the soldiers hit me so hard, I fell to the floor. They threatened to kill me if I moved or yelled again,\" she said, as she wept over the phone. \"The three of them took turns raping me more than once. They then led me back into their car and threw me on the side of the road at sunset,\" she said. After a short pause, Ibtissam described how she felt \"utterly humiliated and angry\". \"I wanted to commit suicide. But I held it together. I went back home and did not tell anyone what happened.\" The UN Human Rights office in Sudan said in early July that it had received reports of 21 incidents of sexual violence against at least 57 women and girls. UN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk noted that \"the RSF has been identified as the perpetrator\" in almost all cases reported to his office. Both the UN and local rights groups believe these numbers are only a fraction of the real scale of the crime. Sudanese human rights activist Ahlam Nasser said she had no doubt that rape was being used \"systematically\" as a weapon of war to terrorise people. \"[Rape] has been used in Darfur in the past and it is being used in this current war in Khartoum, particularly by the RSF,\" she said. The activist has now fled the country. She said she too had heard horror stories from some of the women back in Khartoum. \"In some cases, mothers were raped in front of their children,\" Ms Nasser said. The RSF has denied its fighters are behind these attacks. In a voice recording sent to the BBC, its spokesman Mohammed al-Mukhtar said their fighters \"commit to the highest ethical standards of warfare\". \"There are deliberate campaigns to tarnish the reputation of our fighters after the military victories we've achieved,\" he added. When I told him that I had spoken to women who had identified RSF fighters as their attackers, Mr al-Mukhtar said that people masquerading as RSF members were responsible for the atrocities. The conflict has left survivors of rape and sexual violence with little help. Most hospitals are no longer functioning, and it can be difficult to reach the few that are. Kolthoum and Ibtissam told me the pain will haunt them forever. \"I will never forget what happened to me. A mark of shame will follow me forever, just like my shadow,\" Kolthoum said.",

        "title": "Ukraine war: Russian strike on Zelensky's home city kills six",
        "content": "At least six people, including a 10-year-old girl and her mother, have been killed by a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih. Ukraine's interior minister said 69 others were injured when missiles slammed into a high-rise building and a university on Monday. Regional governor Serhiy Lysak declared a day of mourning for those lost. The home city of President Volodymyr Zelensky, Kryvyi Rih has been a consistent target for Russian strikes. In June, 11 people died and 28 others were injured in the city after Russia launched a \"massive missile attack\" on civilian buildings. The latest attack saw dozens of people hospitalised, including children aged from four to 17-years-old. President Zelensky, who grew up in the city of 600,000 people, said a pair of missiles smashed into the residential apartment block and a university building early on Monday morning. Locals told the Reuters news agency that the attack took place shortly after 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT). A video posted by President Zelensky showed that much of the high-rise building had been completely demolished by the strike, with a large scar running up the structure. But officials said around 150 people managed to escape the blast unharmed. Writing on Telegram, the Ukrainian leader said more than 350 people were involved in rescue operations and Mr Lysak said later that another 30 people were rescued from the building by the emergency workers. President Zelensky added that \"dozens of people\" had been left traumatised and injured by the attack, but vowed that \"this terror will not frighten us or break us\". In recent weeks, Russia has again been stepping up attacks on civilian targets, and Mykhailo Podolyak - a top adviser to Mr Zelensky - accused Moscow of launching \"genocidal\" attacks on Ukrainians. \"International law will never work if the aggressor does not see a real power behind it. The power begins with closing the Ukrainian skies with missile defence and air defence systems,\" he wrote on Twitter. Moscow has consistently denied that it seeks out civilian targets. But Western leaders, including US President Joe Biden, have accused Russia of frequently bombarding areas with \"no military purpose\". Earlier this month, the UN said there have been some 25,671 civilian casualties since Russian launched its invasion of Ukraine last year, but the true figure is likely to be far higher. There will be no forgiveness! Never!\" Mr Lysak wrote in a Telegram post on Monday. Russia would pay, he said, for \"every innocent person killed\" and \"the suffering of our people\". Elsewhere, in the southern region of Kherson, the head of President Zelensky's office, Andriy Yermak, said four people were killed in what local officials called merciless Russian shelling. The Kherson military administration said one of those killed was a 60-year-old utilities worker whose team had come under fire. Several others were injured in the blast. And a drone attack has been reported in Russia's border region of Bryansk - with Governor Alexander Bogomaz saying a police station was hit. On Saturday, Russian officials said three Ukrainian drones were downed in Moscow - the latest in a series of drone assaults on the Russian capital. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin blamed Ukraine for the attack, in which two office blocks were damaged, although there were no casualties. President Zelensky warned that war was coming back to Russia, and that attacks on Russian territory were an \"inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process\" of the war between the two countries.",

        "title": "Pakistan explosion: Eyewitness describes doomsday scenes",
        "content": "\"Doomsday scenes\" unfolded in Pakistan after a suicide bomber targeted a political rally, killing at least 45 people, an eyewitness has told the BBC. People screamed for help as rescuers rushed to the scene in the north-west Bajaur district on Sunday, rally organiser Imran Mahir said. The attack targeted the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), a party that is part of the government coalition. \"A person standing next to me died. Another was injured,\" Mr Mahir said. \"It was a big sound. I initially thought there was a problem with the generator or the sound system. My ears have been ringing and hurting. My head is still hurting.\" The local branch of the Islamic State (IS) group in Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the bombing. The group, who go by the name Islamic State Khorasan (ISKP), said the attack was part of an \"ongoing war against democracy\". ISKP has targeted officials of the political party at least four times since 2017, as it opposes JUI-F's support for democracy in Pakistan. ISKP has also claimed responsibility for several other attacks this year in Bajaur targeting JUI-F. In June, it said they were behind the assassination of a party official in the village of Inayat Killi. Hundreds had turned up for the rally, which was an opportunity for the Islamist JUI-F to rally its support ahead of an election expected to take place later this year. Mr Mahir, who was seated on the stage when the bomb was detonated, described how the explosion unleashed flames and pellets on the crowd that gathered in the town of Khar, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. \"I saw the injured and dead around me. It was very bad situation - it was like doomsday. Soon after the blast there was a panic, it was chaos, people running everywhere,\" he said. \"I don't know why I wasn't injured, it was my luck, my time wasn't over yet. There was a man in his 80s far away from the explosion but he passed,\" he said. Officials have warned the death toll may rise further, as 15 people are in critical condition. A regional leader of the JUI-F, Maulana Ziaullah, was among the fatalities, local officials told the BBC. \"We never thought it would happen to political workers or students and they would do such a big explosion. It was not in our mind, we weren't even thinking of it,\" Mr Mahir said. He said he had been to seven burials overnight. Mr Mahir said however, that morale within the JUI-F ranks remains \"strong and high\", adding, \"We are not going to stop contesting seats, we will carry on. We will face the future\". Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned those responsible as being terrorists who have \"targeted those who speak for Islam, the Quran and Pakistan\" and said they would face \"real punishment\". The Pakistani Taliban (TTP) has condemned the attack and denied any involvement. In recent years attacks the TTP and other militant groups have been on the rise again in north-west Pakistan after the Afghan Taliban gained power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021. The TTP resumed attacks after ending a ceasefire last November.",

        "title": "Ukraine war: Western armour struggles against Russian defences",
        "content": "The general in charge of Ukraine's stuttering counter-offensive in the south has said Russian defences are making it difficult for military equipment, including Western tanks and armoured vehicles, to move forward. Gen Oleksandr Tarnavskyi says his forces are struggling to overcome multi-layered minefields and fortified defensive lines. \"That is why most of the tasks have to be performed by troops.\" He says Russia's military has displayed \"professional qualities\" by preventing Ukrainian forces from \"advancing quickly\". \"I don't underestimate the enemy,\" he adds. Latest unconfirmed reports from the US suggest the main thrust of the counter-offensive has begun. The Institute for the Study of War says Ukrainian forces appear to have broken through \"certain pre-prepared Russian defensive positions\". But so far there's little evidence that Western supplied tanks and armoured vehicles have been able to tip the balance decisively in Ukraine's favour. Several Leopard tanks and US Bradley fighting vehicles were damaged or destroyed in the first days of the offensive, near the city of Orikhiv. Ukraine's 47th Brigade, which had largely been trained and equipped by the West to try to break through Russian lines, were soon stopped in their tracks by mines and then targeted by artillery. Russia released multiple videos of the incident claiming Ukraine's offensive had already failed. In reality it was an early setback rather than a decisive blow. We visited the same brigade's outdoor workshop, hidden in a forest behind the front line, where they are now trying to repair more than a dozen armoured vehicles - most of them US Bradleys. They first arrived unscathed but now bear the scars of battle. Broken tracks and buckled wheels - the tell-tale signs that several have hit Russian mines. Serhii, one of the engineers, says: \"The faster we can repair them, the faster we can get them back to the front line to save someone's life.\" But he also admits that some are beyond repair and will have to be either scavenged for spare parts or \"returned to our partners\" to be rebuilt. While Western armour has provided Ukrainian troops with better protection, it has not been able to punch through the rows of Russian mines - one of the biggest barriers for Ukraine's advance. Travelling the southern front we also saw British supplied Mastiff armoured vehicles damaged and destroyed. The 47th Brigade is now using some of its older, Soviet-era tanks to clear minefields. But they too can't escape the explosives hidden in the ground, even when fitted with specialist mine-clearing equipment. Nearer the front line, tank commander Maksym showed us his recently-damaged T-64 tank. It's been fitted with two rollers on the front to deliberately set off the mines. He lost one of the rollers the night before as he was trying to clear a path for troops. \"Normally our rollers can withstand up to four explosions,\" he says. But the Russians, he adds, have been laying mines on top of each other to destroy their mine clearing equipment. \"It's very hard because there are too many mines,\" Maksym says, adding that there were often more than four rows of minefields in front of the Russian defensive lines. It's been painful to watch the battle unfold for Doc and his drone reconnaissance team from Ukraine's Volunteer Army. Doc, his call sign, took part in last year's successful offensive on Kherson. But he says this time it's proving to be much tougher. For the first time in the war, he says, soldiers are being injured by mines more than artillery: \"When we go forward we meet minefields everywhere.\" Doc shows me a video he recently filmed from one of his drones while Ukrainian troops advanced towards a Russian trench. There's a massive explosion as soon as the soldiers enter. The trench was empty but rigged with mines. Doc says Russian forces are now using remotely controlled mines. \"When our soldiers get to the trenches they push a button and it blows up, killing our friends.\" He says he's seen the tactic being used over the past two weeks and calls it \"a new weapon\". There is a military logic to Ukraine's offensive in the south. It's seen as key to dividing Russian forces and reaching the occupied cities of Melitopol and Mariupol - all the way to Crimea. But the focus on this axis means that Ukraine is also now attacking Russian defensive lines where they're strongest. Gen Tarnavskiy said his forces were doing \"hard and painstaking work\". He said \"any defence can be broken but you need patience time and skilful actions\". Ukraine was slowly wearing down their enemy, he said. Russia didn't care about losing men, and recent changes in their military leadership \"means everything is not OK\", he added. He insisted that Ukraine had yet to commit its main strike force. \"Slow or not, the offensive is taking place and it will definitely reach its goal,\" he says. I ask Gen Tarnavsky how we can judge whether it's a success or a failure? He smiles and replies: \"If the offensive were not successful, I wouldn't be talking to you now.\"",

        "title": "Supreme Court: Why India's powerful top court is in a 'crisis'",
        "content": "Scholars have hailed India's Supreme Court as the most powerful in the world - and not without reason. The 73-year-old court can nullify executive acts, parliamentary laws and amendments to the Constitution. It also has the power to initiate cases independently, appoint \"friends of the court\" to help it in cases, and set up expert panels to aid in its decision-making process. Today, 34 judges handle an overwhelming load of nearly 70,000 appeals and petitions, issuing some 1,000 judgements every year. Yet, despite its great authority and power, the \"court is in crisis\", say Aparna Chandra, Sital Kalantry and William HJ Hubbard in an exhaustive data-driven account called Court on Trial. And the authors find that one of the main reasons is the huge backlog of cases that also leave litigants in limbo and drain them financially. The new work of the troika of law scholars presents several striking findings, drawing from five distinct and exclusive datasets derived from records of over a million Supreme Court cases. Here are some: Most significantly the Special Leave Petitions (SLPs), the preferred means for civil and criminal appeals to the court, constitute over 90% of the court's total docket. This, say the authors of the study, crowd out writ petitions and constitutional challenges. \"There is no clear benchmark for determining which types of cases deserve admission under the SLP route,\" they note. Then there are issues about what the authors say is the \"pick and choose model\" through which some cases jump the queues and get listed for early hearing. The researchers cite a case in July 2020 where the court dismissed a writ which argued that it gave priority to the bail application of a prominent journalist, while the petitioner's case was not being given adequate attention. The judges justified the swift listing of the journalist's case because it pertained to the \"liberty and freedom of media.\" This, the authors say, gave rise to comparisons with a petition filed against the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir questioning the lack of a court-directed mechanism to review decisions on internet restrictions in the region, a case concerning the \"liberty and freedom of media\" of millions of citizens. The heavy backlog has allowed the court to avoid difficult cases by simply not listing them at all, the authors say. This form of \"judicial evasion\" keeps \"important cases hanging, while it focuses on more mundane matters\". The authors provide compelling examples. For instance, the court took a full five years to decide on the challenge to the government's biometric ID scheme, Aadhaar, without issuing any suspension orders. During this period, more than a billion people enrolled for the scheme, effectively undermining the impact of the challenge. (In 2018, the court upheld the scheme, saying it was constitutional and did not violate the right to privacy.) Then there were the petitions questioning electoral bonds, which are interest-free financial instruments for making donations to political parties. The bonds were introduced in February 2018 to flush out illicit cash and make political financing more transparent. Critics say the bonds are \"unconstitutional and problematic\"- there is no public record of who bought each bond and to whom the donation was made. The authors highlight that the case languished for a year, finally being heard in April 2019, coinciding with the general elections. The court took up the petitions again this January, and in March was mulling whether it should be referred to a constitution bench. And this is a case which \"touches on the very nature of India's democratic polity and its possible subversion\", the authors say. The prioritisation of more mundane cases over pressing matters in the court system invites criticism that the \"court uses its backlog as a shield to evade politically sensitive issues\", says Nick Robinson, a fellow at the Harvard Law School. \"Yes it does [invite the criticism of judicial evasion],\" Madan Lokur, a former judge of the Supreme Court, told me. \"But I must admit that the court has taken up some contentious issues for hearing, but also has dumped others like the electoral bonds case.\" Mr Robinson believes the backlog in cases had \"long distanced the court\" from its core goals. \"Hearing so many ordinary cases isn't a requirement of the Constitution, but is a choice the court had actively decided to make\". The court, he says, is \"balancing different competing interests around access, correcting errors made by high courts, and setting out clear and authoritative precedent on major legal issues\". Clearly, delays in the court are happening because of increase in litigation, limited judicial resources and the court's acceptance of a broad number of appeals. The authors of the new study advocate for a reduced caseload. India's Supreme Court crowns a three-tier judicial system: district courts, high courts, and the apex court. The authors of the study say the lower courts should handle the majority of cases, reserving only those that introduce novel legal issues or allow the Supreme Court to establish new, explicit legal guidelines to assist lower courts in future decisions. But high courts are also a part of the problem, says Mr Lokur. He says some judgements of the high court are \"out of sync and the Supreme Court has no option but to interfere in them in appeal\".(By the way, six million cases are pending in India's 25 high courts.) Mr Robinson says the Supreme Court \"needs to decide what institutional goals it wants to prioritise\". \"Many have called on the Supreme Court to take fewer cases, but decide them with larger, more authoritative benches that set out clear precedent for the high courts to follow,\" says Mr Robinson. With a breathtaking pileup of more than 50 million cases clogging all of India's courts, the country's strained justice system remains an agonising crawl and a punishment for common people. The top court, clearly, needs to clean up its own backlog. \"The court must appreciate,\" says Mr Lokur, \"that it cannot correct every error\". BBC News India is now on YouTube.

        "title": "Felix Klieser: The problem-solving French horn player of the BBC Proms",
        "content": "Look at the BBC Proms poster this year and you'll spot some classical big-hitters - the conductor Sir Simon Rattle and cello superstar Sheku Kanneh Mason. But look closer still and you'll clock a suave French horn player\u2026and his toes. Felix Klieser has been described as a virtuoso and has performed all over the world, but born without arms he plays the instrument with his left foot. \"It was a little miracle,\" Felix says, that he became a French horn player at all. Not because of his limb difference but because when he asked to learn the instrument, aged four, his family had no idea what he was talking about. \"I'd never been to a concert, I'd never met a horn player and in my family there was no one making music. My parents said: 'Err, what is a French horn?\" he told the BBC's Access All podcast. His family did some research and lucked out. In the German city of G\u00f6ttingen, where Felix grew up \"there was one music school and at the music school there was one horn teacher\". Felix enrolled and a life-time of problem solving began. Questions rapidly stacked up. How would he play an instrument that requires one hand to support the horn and the other to create the sound? Without fingers, how would he use the valves to change the note? At first it wasn't a problem at all. As a child Felix could sit on the floor and reach the mouthpiece with someone holding the horn. As he grew, he worked with a \"creative person who can build strange things\" to develop a stand which holds the instrument in place. As for the lack of fingers, Felix realised he could kick his left leg up and angle his foot to use his dexterous toes just as well. The position is an impressive sight, even to Felix. \"When I see myself it looks very interesting and very spectacular. But when I play by myself it's a very comfortable position,\" he says. \"It's something I can do for hours.\" The biggest challenge was not an obvious physical one, it was making the French horn actually sound like a French horn. It consists of a 12ft brass tube, which curls round into an open \"bell\" where the sound comes out. Horn players put their right hand in the bell to create the familiar, haunting, sound you might have heard in popular film music like Jurassic Park. Without a hand to put in the bell, Felix realised he would have to create the tone entirely through the way he played. \"There was no teacher who could teach you how to play the horn in this way. It was more trial and error. I've just my lips, I've just my air,\" he says. \"You have to control the air in a different way and take care of the position of your lips, of your tongue. This was maybe the most challenging thing, I practised a lot.\" This technique sets Felix apart from other players. He was recognised very early on in his studies as exceptional by any standard, but even those closest to him doubted he would be accepted into the classical music world. LISTEN: You can hear more from Felix on the BBC Access All podcast. As a teenager, Felix studied at Hanover University of Music, Drama and Media and won a prestigious prize. At the time, he and his teacher were interviewed for a newspaper. The reporter asked Felix if he planned on a professional career. \"My answer was something like: 'Maybe it could be possible, I don't know because I'm still at school''.\" Then his teacher, a famous player, interrupted him. \"It's a good hobby for you, but you will never be a professional horn player. Never, never, never. You don't have the right hand, and the bell works differently. It will never work'.\" It was a sliding doors moment for Felix, who abruptly and unexpectedly learned life offers you two options. \"You have to decide, should I try to show that it is possible or should I give up? These situations happen quite often in my life,\" he says. Rather than strive to become a professional musician, Felix simply wanted to \"play the French horn as good as possible,\" and see how far that would take him. It has taken him all over the world, to the south coast of England where he recently completed a two-year residency with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and even on tour with the singer, Sting. But he says the biggest lesson he learned goes back to his early years. \"The most important thing, when I grew up, is to learn to solve problems,\" he says. \"I never knew what is possible for me and what is not possible. But when you have a way of thinking, 'Ok, I can solve every problem,' then you have many, many possibilities in your life. \"And this is not a question of having a disability or not, because in the end all of us has something where he or she thinks 'Ok, there is a limit'.\" Felix faced a serious challenge recently. One that is relatable to all of us - getting through the Covid-19 pandemic. As a professional musician, he went from having a full concert schedule to nothing. \"I stopped practising because it was not necessary anymore,\" he says. \"Then I bought a PlayStation and did a lot of PlayStation,\" using the controller with his toes. One day it occurred to him: \"Maybe it's a little bit sad for my horn to be in the case and not to be useful anymore?\" He took it out and they became re-acquainted. After all these years together he gave it a name - Alex. He even bought some googly eyes to bring Alex to life. Then he cast his eyes around and wondered what non-musical activities Alex could get involved with if he wasn't being played - cooking was the first to come to mind and to entertain his online followers. Even now with a full concert schedule once again, Alex lives a very fulfilled and varied life for a horn. It has been a fun way to connect with fans all over the world but some will get to watch Felix play in London when he takes to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall for his BBC Proms debut on 2 and 3 August. He will perform Mozart's Horn Concerto No. 4. \"I'm excited,\" he says. \"For me the most important thing is to get to know the audience here. \"When you're young and start a career then you're looking to play with famous conductors, famous orchestras. But right now I want to play music for people to make the world a little bit more beautiful.\" You can listen to the podcast and find information and support on the Access All page.",

        "title": "Afghanistan: Taliban burn \u2018immoral\u2019 musical instruments",
        "content": "The Taliban have burned musical instruments in Afghanistan, claiming music \"causes moral corruption\". Thousands of dollars worth of musical equipment went up in smoke on a bonfire on Saturday in western Herat province. Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed numerous restrictions, including on playing music in public. Ahmad Sarmast, Afghanistan National Institute of Music founder, likened their actions to \"cultural genocide and musical vandalism\". \"The people of Afghanistan have been denied artistic freedom\u2026 The burning of musical instruments in Herat is just a small example of the cultural genocide that is taking place in Afghanistan under the leadership of the Taliban,\" Dr Sarmast, who is now based in Portugal, told the BBC. Some of the items set ablaze in Herat included a guitar, a harmonium and a tabla - a kind of drum - as well as amplifiers and speakers, according to images online. Many of these had been seized from wedding venues in the city. An official at the Taliban's Vice and Virtue Ministry said playing music would \"cause the youth to go astray\". A similar bonfire of instruments was organised by the Taliban on 19 July. Its government posted photos of the blaze on Twitter at the time but did not say which part of the country it had taken place in. All forms of music were banned from social gatherings, TV, and radio while the Taliban were in power in Afghanistan from the mid-90s until 2001. A music scene flourished in the two decades that followed, but the Taliban's return in August 2021 prompted many musicians to flee the country. Singers and musicians still in the country are reported to have been subjected to beatings and discrimination. In the past two years, the Taliban have imposed other severe restrictions under their strict interpretation of Islamic law. Women have borne the brunt of these harsh measures. The Taliban have decreed they should be dressed in a way that only reveals their eyes, and must be accompanied by a male relative if they are travelling more than 72km (45 miles). Teenage girls and women have also been barred from entering school and university classrooms, gyms and parks. Last week all hair and beauty salons across the country were ordered to shut on the Taliban's orders, after being deemed un-Islamic.",

        "title": "Niger coup: Ousted President Mohamed Bazoum meets Chad's leader",
        "content": "Niger's ousted president has been seen for the first time since the military detained him in a coup last week. Mohamed Bazoum met Chad's leader, Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by Itno, in Niger's capital, Niamey. Mr D\u00e9by, who also met the coup leaders, is spearheading mediation efforts after West African leaders gave Niger's military seven days to give up power. The junta accused the ousted government of authorising France to carry out an attack to try to free Mr Bazoum. Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, the head of the presidential guards unit, declared himself Niger's new ruler on Friday. Mr D\u00e9by said his mediation effort was aimed at finding a \"peaceful solution to the crisis which is shaking\" Niger, which borders Chad. He did not give details, but his office released a photo of him sitting next to a smiling Mr Bazoum. Mr D\u00e9by was himself put in power by the army after his father was killed fighting rebel forces in 2021. He was sent to Niger by leaders of the West African regional bloc, Ecowas. On Sunday they gave the junta a week to reinstate the elected president, who has been confined to the presidential palace in Niamey. The regional bloc would \"take all measures necessary to restore constitutional order\" if its demands were not met. \"Such measures may include the use of force,\" a statement added. The junta has not commented on the demands, but it has vowed to defend Niger from any \"aggression\" by regional or Western powers. It has accused former colonial power France of planning military intervention. On Monday, Col Amadou Abdramane, one of the coup leaders, said the toppled government had authorised France, Niger's former colonial power, to attack the presidential palace to try to free Mr Bazoum. France did not confirm or deny the claim. In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, the French foreign ministry said the only authority it recognised in Niger was President Bazoum's. France and the US both have military bases in Niger. Also on Monday, Mr Bazoum's party said six of its senior figures were among 130 of its members arrested by the junta since Sunday. The six include four members of the ousted cabinet, a former minister and the party leader, the Nigerien Party for Democracy and Socialism (PNDS) said. The coup has prompted concern that Niger, a key Western ally in the fight against jihadist groups in West Africa, could pivot towards Russia. Neighbouring Burkina Faso and Mali have both moved away from France, and towards Russia, after staging their own coups in recent years. On Sunday, protesters outside the French embassy in Niamey chanted \"Long live Russia\", \"Long live Putin\" and \"Down with France\". They also set fire to the walls of the embassy compound. France would not tolerate any attack on its interests in Niger, and would respond in an \"immediate and intractable manner\", President Emmanuel Macron's office said.

        "title": "Space junk: India says object found in Australia is theirs",
        "content": "India has confirmed that an object that washed up on a Western Australian beach recently was from one of its rockets. The giant metal dome was found at Green Head beach, about 250km (155 miles) north of Perth, in mid-July - prompting speculation about its origins. India's space agency spokesman told the BBC on Monday it was from one of its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles (PSLV). Sudhir Kumar added that it would be up to Australia to decide what to do with the object. He did not comment further. His comments came after the Australian Space Agency (ASA) on Wednesday said that the object was \"most likely\" the third stage of a PSLV, which are used by India to launch satellites into orbit. Countries often plan for debris from their launches to land in oceans to prevent them damaging people and property. Dr Alice Gorman, a space archaeologist and Associate Professor at Australia's Flinders University, said that while there are often serial numbers on components, it was also possible to identify debris based on appearance. The ASA said it was working with India's space agency to \"determine next steps, including considering obligations under the United Nations space treaties\". The BBC has approached the agency for further comment. According to the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs, countries are required to return any \"foreign\" space objects found in their territory to the owners. Dr Gorman said that there were many reasons why a country would want debris back, such as mission analysis. In this case, however, she said there would be no benefit in India retrieving the object. Western Australia has already indicated it would be happy to keep it. The state's premier, Roger Cook, suggested to local media that the object could be stored in the state museum alongside debris from Nasa's Skylab station, which was discovered in 1979. Locals said they might be interested in turning it into a local tourist attraction, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Dr Gorman said another option would be to put in a park, adding: \"Things that have been in space have this kind of aura and to touch something that has been in space would be a bit special.\" The object is currently in storage with the ASA. It is still not clear which mission it was used in, nor how long it had been in the water before washing up at Green Head. Experts estimated that it would have been at least a few months. The debris was covered with barnacles. There were initially concerns about potentially dangerous toxins leaking from the object if it was found to be part of a rocket. However, the authorities later determined it was not a risk to the public. The ASA has asked that any members of the public who finds further suspected debris should get in contact with them. It is not the first time that space junk has landed in Australia. Last year, a chunk from one of Elon Musk's Space X missions was found in a paddock in the state of New South Wales.",

        "title": "Ousmane Sonko: Senegalese opposition leader charged - again",
        "content": "Ousmane Sonko, a leading opposition figure in Senegal, has been charged with new offences and his party dissolved. The interior minister said Mr Sonko and his Pastef party had been calling for insurrection. The firebrand opposition leader is in custody. His supporters believe all charges against him are politically motivated - to prevent him from standing in next year's elections, which the authorities have denied. In June, he was at the centre of a controversial rape trial which saw him sentenced to two years in prison for \"corrupting youth\", meaning he was found to have acted immorally towards an individual younger than 21, after allegations made by a massage therapist. He was, however, acquitted of rape and making death threats. That sentencing sparked violent protests in one of Africa's most stable nations which left at least 16 people dead and hundreds injured, according to officials. However, he wasn't taken to prison but remained under house arrest, until Friday when he was arrested. In order to forestall a repeat of such protests, Senegal has restricted access to the internet, as it did in June. Despite the controversial rape trial, he is hugely popular among young Senegalese people who demand change amid a backdrop of economic hardship. His critics, however, accuse his movement of being a populist surge stoking division and tension. Some say the 48-year-old tax inspector-turned-whistleblower is so popular because he has been electrifying young people with a slick social media campaign, which he uses to rip into Senegalese elites and whip up nationalist sentiment. Using his youthful charm and digital connection with the youth, Mr Sonko drums up support by posing as a generational shift from Senegal's old political order. A public law graduate, he rose from being dismissed as a tax inspector for speaking publicly about alleged tax evasion to become a member of the National Assembly, and then last year mayor of the southern city of Ziguinchor. In and out of court since 2021, not much has been achieved during his tenure as mayor, but his supporters say he gives them hope and is an anti-corruption figurehead. \"He's anti-system,\" says step-dancer Pape Samba Ndour, a staunch supporter of Mr Sonko. \"The system we got has been here since 1960. We want a new image of Senegal. He's against corruption.\"Mr Sonko was the youngest candidate in the country's 2019 presidential election where he came third with about 16% of the vote. His fiery campaign speeches denouncing the government resonated favourably with many young Senegalese - and the country has a large youth population, with the average age in the country being 19, according to a government report. The Patriots of Senegal (Pastef), the party he formed in 2014, has also gained political momentum. Many young Senegalese frustrated by economic and social inequalities see the party as a viable alternative, in a country where nearly four in 10 live below the poverty line and about 22% of working age people are without a job. \"President Macky Sall didn't factor them [youths] into his political decisions,\" former Prime Minister Aminata Tour\u00e9, a former close ally of Mr Sall but now one of his harshest critics, tells the BBC. So Mr Sonko's promise to create jobs and grow the economy, which the World Bank says slowed down last year, has attracted followers. But his detractors say he is a rabble-rouser who uses populism to win public sympathy. Women's right groups also condemned Mr Sonko for making derogatory comments about the woman he was accused of raping during his trial, comparing her to a \"monkey\" who had had a stroke. Others highlight his inflammatory language, such as in 2018, when he said that \"those who have ruled Senegal deserve to be shot\". More recently, they say the rhetoric of his Pastef party, which called on citizens to \"stop all activity and take to the streets\" after he was sentenced, encouraged protests. He denies this. His criticism of Senegal elites' cosy relationship with France, the country's former colonial power, also strikes a chord among supporters. France has been a target of embittered African complaints and criticism, especially among progressive French-speaking West African commentators and urban youths. Although China overtook it in 2019, France is historically Senegal's largest source of foreign investment. Many French businesses such as supermarkets, petrol stations, mobile phone shops and other firms operate in Senegal, which some believe is harming the interests of local business owners. It is common to see French-owned businesses being targeted during deadly protests like the ones last month. The slogan \"France D\u00e9gage\" (France Out) is also popular during demonstrations. Before now a taboo subject in Senegal, Mr Sonko's call for a \"responsible and intelligent\" exit from the CFA franc - the regional currency used by 14 African countries and pegged to the euro under a French government guarantee - has increased his popularity. While supporters say the CFA guarantees financial stability, critics say it is a way for France to continue to exercise control over the countries which use it. For one, Mr Ndour, 27, supports Mr Sonko because he \"is against\" giving all of Senegal's resources to France. Mr Sonko says he has \"nothing against France, or against any other country\". But the centuries-old links between Senegal and France are \"based on relations that are not completely rosy for Senegal\", he told state-owned France M\u00e9dias Monde. Pastef won 56 of Senegal's 165 parliamentary seats in the 2022 National Assembly election after forming an alliance with four other parties. This achievement has emboldened Mr Sonko and led his supporters to believe he have a good shot at the presidency. But Mr Sonko's name may be missing on the ballot in next February's polls because his conviction appears to threaten his eligibility, according to Senegal's electoral code. However he can ask for retrial. But now that he faces trial on different charges, that looks more difficult. For his supporters, this brings flashbacks of the convictions that barred two strong opposition candidates ahead of the 2019 presidential election. Both Karim Wade, the son of former President Abdoulaye Wade, and Khalifa Sall, a former mayor of Dakar who is not related to President Sall, were jailed for graft and corruption in 2015 and 2018, respectively. Critics say the government is using the judiciary to hound the opposition. The government retorts that there is a separation of powers and accuses the opposition of stoking chaos. Mr Ndour, who has been organising demonstrations online, hopes Mr Sonko and every other potential candidate are not barred from running for the presidency. Much of the anger over Mr Sonko's arrest was fuelled by speculation that President Sall could run for a third term, which they argued was unconstitutional. He has since announced that he will not, which Mr Sonko's supporters see as victory. However, that victory would feel empty if their man's name is also missing from the ballot paper.

        "title": "Mar-a-Lago worker Carlos de Oliveira appears in court",
        "content": "The property manager at Donald Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, has appeared in court in Miami as part of the probe into alleged mishandling of classified documents there. Charges against Carlos de Oliveira were filed last week as prosecutors widened their inquiry into Mr Trump and another aide, Walt Nauta. Officials allege Mr de Oliveira tried to delete CCTV footage of Mr Trump's home after a visit by the FBI. He is set to enter a plea on 10 August. The timescale was pushed back to allow him time to hire a lawyer in Florida. Mr de Oliveira's Washington DC-based lawyer described the new charges as \"unfortunate\". Mr de Oliveira was also ordered to surrender his passport and sign an agreement to pay $100,000 (\u00a378,000) if he does not show up for the next hearing. He was banned from contacting any witnesses in the case. According to US media, Mr de Oliveira, 56, is a long-time maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago. He faces charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and lying to federal investigators. The revised indictment said the justice department requested video footage on 22 June 2022 after FBI agents identified relevant cameras on a visit earlier that month. The indictment alleged Mr Trump and Mr de Oliveira had a 24-minute phone call on 23 June. The next day, 24 June, a final demand for footage was emailed to Mr Trump's lawyers and, hours later, Mr Nauta changed his travel plans to head to Mar-a-Lago, the indictment claimed. The indictment outlined what prosecutors said happened in the following days. According to the court document, it is alleged Mr Nauta and Mr de Oliveira conspired in an effort to delete the surveillance video. Prosecutors claimed Mr de Oliveira twice told a Mar-a-Lago IT worker that \"the boss\" wanted a video server deleted, in a conversation he said must remain private. The IT worker responded that he did not believe he had the authority to do that, according to the indictment. Prosecutors also said he lied when he told them he \"never saw anything\" when he was asked about witnessing boxes of classified materials being moved. The indictment also described a scene in which Mr de Oliveira \"walked through the bushes\" into a property adjacent to the Mar-a-Lago resort to meet Mr Nauta. Later, the new court filing added, Mr Trump phoned Mr de Oliveira and promised to provide him with a lawyer. It is unclear whether prosecutors obtained the security footage they sought. Mr Nauta and Mr Trump, who both face new allegations, have already pleaded not guilty to previous charges in the classified documents inquiry. The fresh allegations add to the former president's growing list of legal problems. He currently awaits trial on 34 felony counts in a hush-money case in New York, and also faces a defamation case from writer E Jean Carroll. Georgia prosecutors are still weighing whether or not to press state charges over an alleged effort to overturn the election results there. Justice department special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the classified documents investigation, is also considering whether to charge Mr Trump for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.",

        "title": "Women's World Cup 2023: Rare feeling for US fans ahead of Portugal clash",
        "content": "Fans of the US women's team are unusually on edge as their crunch World Cup game against Portugal looms. Some are even thinking the unthinkable. \"I think I gained about 13,000 more grey hairs from this last match,\" says fan Chris Lawler as he reflects in Auckland. Its not the sentiment that usually accompanies the side. This team has dominated international women's football over the past decade and have developed a fearsome aura. The reigning champions, they have won two World Cups in a row and are the hot favourites for a record third. But a series of lacklustre performances so far has fans like Lawler on edge. The football fan who sports a blue-dyed, Megan Rapinoe hairstyle says that following this USA team can be nerve wracking despite the rewards. This generational side has so far struggled to gel as a unit and play homogenously. They beat debutants Vietnam 3-0 and drew one all against the Netherlands. Despite still being at the top of the group table, those first two performances - especially that draw with the Dutch - failed to impress. And Lawler isn't the only one to notice. \"We're unsatisfied with the way that we've played, but we know the areas that we can be better,\" US star Megan Rapinoe said on Sunday. \"And I think there's some really simple fixes that we can do to put ourselves in a better position.\" Her side will have a chance to set the record straight when they play their third game against Portugal tomorrow in group E. But lose and they could be on a plane home. But something is changing in this tournament. The fiery stars and stripes have been rather lethargic and unconvincing so far. They are missing their experienced captains Becky Sauerbrunn, forward Mallory Swanson and midfielder Sam Mewis through injury. The team now boasts veterans like Rapinoe and Alex Morgan and debutants including young forwards Alyssa Thompson, 18, Trinity Rodman, 21, and Sophia Smith, who was last year's most valuable player of the National Women's Soccer league (NWSL). Veteran superstar Rapinoe has acknowledged that her team has yet to live up to its own hype in this tournament. \"It's a pressure moment, and that's what the tournament is now. Every single game from here on out is that pressure moment and that's the best part of being at the World Cup,\" she said on Sunday. The USA are now level on four points with the Dutch and are currently top of the table on goal differences. But a big win for the Netherlands against Vietnam could see the Americans bumped to second place. All of this has made the game against Portugal more pivotal and edgy than any USA fan would have liked it to be. \"I hope they get momentum. I hope they get scared and hungry. And that we can take the next game and go into the next stage in a much better position,\" said Ann Mastrota, who travelled with her daughter Katy from Washington DC. US head coach Vlatko Andonovski said in a news conference today that the Portugal match \"will absolutely not be a walk in the park\". \"They are a great team, they are very well coached, they are disciplined, organised,\" he said. \"We are so focused on this game and making sure we get a favourable result.\" Sports Journalist Jeff Kassouf said that while the USA are still favourites to win, they haven't looked their dominant selves on the pitch. \"They're a team that is used to being on top of the world,\" he said. \"(But) they're a team that is wobbling a bit. World Cups are all about timing. The timing for them is consistent injuries, unsure line up situations and it's made them very beatable. I don't think anybody is scared of them right now.\" There've been many upsets in this tournament. From Colombia beating twice world champions Germany 2-1, Japan thrashing Spain 3-nil, to Nigeria stunning co-hosts Australia 3-2. Teams are getting better and nothing can be taken for granted, not even a US win. \"The rest of the world is catching up and this world cup is going to be lot more competitive than the past years,\" Michelle Tropeano, who travelled from New Jersey said. She tells the BBC she's hoping the team will up their game. \"I hope we fire on all cylinders for the full 90 minutes and not just 45.\" Winning this match against Portugal is not just about the US securing their position in the knockout stages. It's also about them reassuring their fans and themselves that they're still deserving of their formidable status.",

        "title": "Women's World Cup: Euphoria in Philippines after historic campaign",
        "content": "The Philippines has bowed out of the Women's World Cup after a euphoric campaign that united a country where football is not the national sport. It was a \"magical\" debut that saw the country's first World Cup goal and gave birth to new sport idols, the Philippine Football Federation said. The Filipinas lost to Norway 6-0 on Sunday, five days after handing hosts New Zealand a shock 1-0 loss. Filipinos cheered their new sports heroes, who vowed to return stronger. Coach Alen Stajcic praised the team, many of whom are Filipino-American, for punching \"so far above their weight\". \"They are a classy team and they picked us apart. We tried hard all the way to the end and I am proud of the heart and spirit of our team,\" he said. Striker Sarina Bolden, who scored the country's historic first World Cup goal during the match with New Zealand, said on Sunday: \"As is how football goes, things [don't always] go in your way.\" \"In the New Zealand game, everything was going in our way but now we feel the pain of things not going in our way. And we just learn and we grow from here,\" she said. The Filipinas' supporters showed up in full force on Sunday, making up the majority of the 35,000 spectators at New Zealand's national stadium. Back home in the Philippines, the country's largest shopping mall operator, SM Supermalls, organised viewing parties that attracted large crowds despite monsoon rains. Supporters flooded social media with praises and encouragement. \"Herstory was made because of you, Filipinas! Thank you for raising our flag and making us feel the joy of being Pinoy. We're proud of you,\" Filipino fast-food chain Jollibee posted on Facebook. Pinoy is slang for Filipino. \"The Philippines will forever be one of the stories of the [2023 Women's World Cup],\" wrote Instagram user Junn Monte De Ramos. \"It doesn't matter that they haven't qualified for the knockout stage. They've inspired millions of Filipino female footballers back home\u2026 which is a far greater victory,\" he wrote. The Philippines fell behind early on Sunday night after three goals to Norway in the first half. An own goal and a penalty widened Norway's lead to 5-0 early in the second half. The Filipinas were overwhelmed 6-0 by the end of the match, bowing out of their historic World Cup campaign with one win and two losses, while Norway advances to the round-of-16. The Philippine Football Federation said the team's \"magical journey\" in the World Cup is \"just the beginning\". Mr Stajcic has called on Filipino sports authorities to increase investments in football to give the country a stronger shot in future tournaments, AFP reported. Since the 49-year-old was appointed as head coach in late 2021, the Filipinas' have jumped from 68th in the FIFA world rankings to their current and best-ever 46th place. Former player Camille Rodriguez has also urged sponsors to continue supporting the Filipinas so that their World Cup appearance will not be a one-off. \"It shouldn't just be in this World Cup that we do things right, but in the days after the World Cup,\" she said in a report by local media company ABS-CBN. Football is a niche sport in the Philippines where the most popular sports are basketball, due to the US occupation, and boxing, buoyed by superstars like Manny Pacquiao. The Filipinas' World Cup campaign has reignited interest in football, as seen in a jump on internet searches for the team and their merchandise. It is a level of popularity not seen since the 2010s, when the men's national team, known as the Azkals, went on an Asian winning streak. Unlike the women however, they did not reach the World Cup.",

        "title": "What do we know about drone attacks in Russia?",
        "content": "Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of carrying out drone strikes on its territory in recent months. Russia's defence ministry said three drones were downed in the country's capital Moscow on 30 July, with two crashing into offices. Although Ukraine hasn't claimed responsibility for specific incidents, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that attacks on Russian territory were an \"inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process\". According to Russian media reports monitored by BBC Verify, there have been more than 120 suspected drone attacks this year in Russia and Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. These have been concentrated in the Bryansk and Belgorod regions in Russia near the western border with Ukraine, as well as in Russian-annexed Crimea. There have been a series of drone attacks in the Moscow region in recent months, which is about 450km (280 miles) from the border, including a wave of strikes on 30 May which damaged several buildings. Flights were forced to be diverted from Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow after a drone attack on 4 July. It was also shut briefly following the drone attacks on 30 July. Russia accused Ukraine of trying to kill President Vladimir Putin in an alleged attack on his residence in the Kremlin on 3 May, which Kyiv denies. Oil facilities, airfields and energy infrastructure have all been targeted in 2023. We have identified at least nine reported drone attacks on oil depots. One of these was in Sevastopol, a major city in Crimea, which was hit on 29 April, destroying several of its oil tanks. On 31 May, an oil refinery was set ablaze in Krasnodar Territory in southern Russia, about 200km (124 miles) from the Crimean border. The regional governor said it was probably caused by a drone. Layla Guest, an analyst at Sibylline security consultancy, says: \"Ukrainian forces will highly likely prioritise targeting oil refineries, as well as railway infrastructure and wider Russian logistics, to cause maximum disruption as part of their strategy ahead of the impending counter-offensive.\" In February, a drone crashed about 100 km (62 miles) from Moscow, in what the local governor said was an attempt to target civilian infrastructure. A picture of the wreckage appeared to be consistent with a UJ-22 - a type of drone manufactured by Ukraine. It has a range of 800km (497 miles) in autonomous flight. Its range under directly-controlled flight is much shorter. Another suspected drone attack injured at least 10 Russian soldiers at a military training ground in the Voronezh Region on 10 May, according to local media reports. And in December last year, a drone attack hit an airbase 600km (372 miles) north-east of the Ukrainian border, leaving three people dead, according to the Russian military. Drones have been deployed by both sides in the conflict, with Russia using Iranian-made drones on targets in Ukraine. Ukraine says it is rapidly increasing its production of drones as demand grows on the front line. In terms of range, experts say drones launched from Ukraine could reach deep into Russian territory, and as far as Moscow, which is about 450km (280 miles) from the border. \"Although Ukraine has not confirmed that its armed forces carried out the attacks [on Moscow], I think that the pre-emptive raids we have seen last year prove that Ukraine has the capability to launch long range attacks of that kind from within Ukrainian territory,\" says David Cenciotti, editor of the Aviationist blog. Drone specialist Steve Wright also said it was possible that a drone could hit the Kremlin having been launched from within Ukraine. But he added: \"My guess is that the drone was launched from far closer in than that, as this would avoid it having to run the gauntlet of much of Moscow's defences.\" Ukraine's Minister for Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov boasted of a Ukrainian drone called the R18 that \"can fly from Kyiv to Moscow and back\". But he denied that he was calling for drone strikes on Moscow. Mr Cenciotti says: \"Ukraine has made extensive use of several drones, with the Bayraktar TB2 drone emerging as the real star of the air war for Ukraine, inflicting heavy losses on Russian forces, some of those caught on tape and circulated online.\" Turkey has sold Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine in recent months, while the Turkish manufacturer of the drones has donated some to crowd-funding operations in support of Ukraine.

        "content": "US actor Paul Reubens, who rose to fame in the 1980s as the character Pee-wee Herman, died at 70 on Sunday after a private struggle with cancer. \"Paul bravely and privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit,\" said a statement released by his estate on Monday. Reubens' iconic cult Herman character led to a TV series and multiple films. But he put aside the role for nearly 20 years after being arrested for indecent exposure in 1991 at a movie theatre. In a posthumously released statement on his Instagram account the actor spoke about keeping his diagnosis private. \"Please accept my apology for not going public with what I've been facing the last six years,\" the statement said. \"I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you.\" His estate added that he was an \"iconic American actor, comedian, writer and producer whose beloved character Pee-wee Herman delighted generations of children and adults with his positivity, whimsy and belief in the importance of kindness\". \"A gifted and prolific talent, he will forever live in the comedy pantheon and in our hearts as a treasured friend and man of remarkable character and generosity of spirit,\" the statement continued. Reubens created the character when he was part of Los Angeles improv group The Groundlings. He starred in the 1985 film Pee-wee's Big Adventure and in the TV series Pee-wee's Playhouse, which ran from 1986 to 1991. The programme, which he created, co-wrote and co-directed earned 22 Emmy Awards. In 1991, he was arrested at an adult movie theatre in Sarasota, Florida, for allegedly touching himself inappropriately. The charges were later dropped but the incident tarnished his reputation. He stopped doing interviewed as his character and did not publicly reprise the role until 2010. In 2016, he co-wrote and starred in Pee-wee's Big Holiday for Netflix. It was his final role before his death. In the statement announcing his death, his representatives asked that \"expressions of sympathy\" be made in his parents' honour to organisations researching cancer, dementia and Alzheimer's. Comedians Steve Martin and Jimmy Kimmel are among the celebrities leading tributes to him online. Kimmel called him a \"brilliant and original comedian who made kids and their parents laugh at the same time\". Martin thanked him for \"the brilliant off the wall comedy\". Director Paul Feig added: \"Paul was such a comedy genius. From his Letterman appearances to his TV shows and movies, he was so original and hilarious. \"And such a sweet man too. This is a huge loss for comedy. Thanks for all the laughs, Paul.\" Director Guillermo del Toro called him \"one of the patron saints of all misfitted, weird, maladjusted, wonderful, miraculous oddities\".",

        "content": "China is pressuring Uyghurs living abroad to spy on human rights campaigners by threatening families back home, researchers say. Refugees and activists tell the BBC intimidating tactics are tearing communities apart. \"My dearest son,\" said Alim's mother as she flickered into view. \"I didn't think I'd see you before I died.\" Alim - not his real name - says he was overcome by the moment. The reunion over a video call was their first contact in six years, since he fled as a refugee to the UK. But it was bittersweet: someone else was in control of the call. Like all Uyghurs - a mostly Muslim minority from north-western China - Alim's mother lives under intense surveillance and control. They could never call each other directly. Instead, a middleman phoned Alim and his mother from two separate mobiles. He held the phone screens to face each other, so the pair could see wobbly images of each other - and hear muffled sound from the speakers. Alim says they barely spoke, and spent most of the call in tears. He doesn't know if the plain white wall he could see behind his mother was in her house in Xinjiang or an internment camp, where the Chinese government is alleged to have detained more than a million Uyghurs. China has long denied those charges. But Alim says he knew this contact with his mother would come at a cost - because the man brokering the call was a Chinese police officer. When the officer called again, he asked Alim to attend meetings of Uyghur human rights activists, gather intelligence and pass it back to the Chinese state. \"Whenever there was an anti-China protest in London, they would call me and ask who would be attending,\" says Alim, who shared with the BBC recordings of the phone calls requesting he work as a spy. Alim was offered money, too, so he could try to befriend the leaders of campaign groups - many of them UK citizens - by taking them to restaurants and picking up the bill. The officer suggested setting up a company as a front, in case suspicions were raised about his newfound wealth. Plenty of businesses had already been set up on behalf of others for that exact purpose, Alim was told. The implied threat, that his family may come to harm if he refused, has left him in a vicious bind. \"They are using my family as hostages,\" Alim says. \"I am living in a dark moment.\" Watch more on BBC Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on Monday 31 July, or catch up afterwards on BBC iPlayer The tactics employed by governments to police their diasporas abroad are known as transnational repression. Research suggests this particular kind - controlling access to family members in the home country through video calls, in exchange for compliance overseas - is commonly used by Chinese police. Dr David Tobin at the University of Sheffield has conducted some of the most comprehensive research on the topic to date, with his colleague Nyrola Elim\u00e4. They have interviewed and surveyed more than 200 members of the Uyghur diaspora in several countries. He says all Uyghurs living outside China are victims of transnational repression. \"Family separation is the central tactic,\" he says. Even where phone calls are technically possible, relatives still living in China won't pick up, according to Dr Tobin. He says there is an assumption that calls will be monitored, and a fear that communicating freely will put them at risk. This severing of family ties allows Chinese police to step in and offer tightly managed access - over video calls - as an incentive to comply, with the threat of repercussions for the family if they do not. In the UK, Dr Tobin surveyed or interviewed 48 Uyghurs, from a population of about 400 people. Of those, two-thirds reported having been contacted directly by Chinese police - and pressured to spy, refrain from advocacy work, or stop speaking to the media. And Uyghurs in the UK are far from the worst affected. In Turkey, traditionally a safe haven for Uyghurs where 50,000 live in one of the largest communities outside China, 80% of the 148 of respondents reported similar threats from Chinese authorities. Abdurehim Para\u00e7 arrived in Istanbul in 2014, having fled China a year earlier. \"Turkey was completely different to anything we'd experienced. We could travel wherever we wanted. The police didn't bother us,\" he says. \"I couldn't believe such a life was possible.\" But in the past few years, the picture has changed for Uyghurs in Turkey. Reports that police based in China have pressured people to spy on each other have filtered through the community, splintering their sense of camaraderie. In a video posted on Facebook, a young Uyghur man who appears to have been captured and beaten by his peers, offers a troubled confession - admitting to spying on behalf of Beijing. While the circumstances surrounding the scene are unclear, the footage has been circulated among the Uyghur community, and the man has been widely condemned online. The accumulation of stories like these is having an effect, Abdurehim says. \"Young people are distancing themselves from Uyghur protests and meetings. They are worried that people there might be spies,\" he says. \"China's plan is working.\" Dr Tobin thinks Turkish authorities are aware of what's happening and have been slow to respond. \"The more dependent a country is on investment from China, the more likely it is to cooperate or to turn a blind eye,\" he says. Turkey is seen as having grown closer to China in recent years, and questions have been raised about its commitment to protecting its Uyghur community. The Turkish government did not respond to a request for comment. But China is not only targeting people in countries where it has economic supremacy. Julie Millsap, a US-born activist who works with the Uyghur Human Rights Project in Washington DC, says China has tried to pressure her through her in-laws. Her husband is Han Chinese, part of the country's largest ethnic group, and the two met in China before moving to the US capital in 2020. After Julie began campaigning on behalf of Uyghurs, local police began dropping in on her extended family in China, saying they \"wanted to be friends\". She and her husband received threatening messages from her sister-in-law's phone, suggesting Julie's children may end up \"as orphans\". \"They weren't written in a language style that she used,\" says Julie, who suspects the police were instructing her to send them. During a recent video call between her husband, in Washington DC, and his sister, in China, the police happened to stop by, allowing Julie to record the moment, and confront one of the officers directly. \"He stammered and asked us not to misinterpret his intentions,\" she says. The officer told her police were arranging visits to all local families with US relatives, in light of the \"delicate\" relationship between the US and China. Julie recognises that a white American and a Han Chinese family are afforded a degree of safety that Uyghurs are not. \"But we're still talking about police harassment, about threats, about a daily reality that is anything but good,\" she says. She thinks it is alarming that Chinese authorities feel comfortable targeting foreign citizens and attempting to dictate their work. The US government is beginning to address the problem formally. In March, senators introduced the Transnational Repression Policy Act, listing a range of abuses including \"coercion by proxy\", which covers threats to family members overseas. If passed, the law would see the creation of a dedicated phone line to report threats, and prompt Congress to bring sanctions against perpetrators wherever possible. Abduweli Ayup, a Uyghur rights campaigner based in Norway, thinks the US legislation would be a step in the right direction, but that Western governments should go further. Each time a case is reported to the authorities, questions should be lodged directly with the Chinese government, requesting assurance that family members are safe, he says. \"We are your citizens, your neighbours and your taxpayers. Our governments should take some responsibility,\" says Mr Ayup. Dr Tobin recognises the complications inherent in tackling the issue. \"Saying 'would you like to speak to your family?' isn't a crime. We know it's a threat. We know it breaks communities, and causes mental health problems and trauma, but it is not a crime on British soil,\" he says. The UK Home Office says attempts to intimidate overseas critics are \"unacceptable\", that an internal review into transnational repression is underway, and all such incidents should be reported to law enforcement. In a statement, the Chinese Embassy in London called the allegations of transnational repression \"totally groundless\". The Chinese government \"protects Uyghurs and their communication with overseas relatives in accordance with the law\", it said. Alim chose not to report his case to the police, but confessed his predicament to a group of Uyghur rights activists in London. One of the group's leaders told us the requests were very common, and posed challenges to the integrity of the community - but insisted their advocacy work would continue. In their experience, almost all advances from Chinese police are rejected. Alim wrestled with the issue before reaching a decision. \"I realised that betraying others for the sake of my family would mean selling out my nation, and I couldn't do that. \"If that was the price I had to pay, so be it.\" He too refused China's offer.",

        "content": "Cardi B became the latest star to be hit by an object from the crowd during a concert, when an audience member threw their drink at the rapper. The 30-year-old reacted by throwing her microphone at the concertgoer from the stage. Although the rapper no longer had a microphone, her voice was still heard on the pre-recorded backing track playing through the speakers. BBC News has asked representatives for Cardi B for comment. The incident took place in Las Vegas and was caught on camera from multiple angles by several fans. In the footage, security staff are seen surrounding the perpetrator and recovering the rapper's microphone. However, footage from earlier in the concert showed Cardi B asking a different member of the audience to spray her from behind, as she turned her back to the crowd. Later in the show, the rapper explained the earlier spray had been done on her back and under her own instruction, whereas she objected to the other member of the crowd unexpectedly throwing water which hit her face. According to entertainment website TMZ, the woman who was struck by the microphone later reported the incident to Las Vegas police. Although Cardi B's microphone was live, the fact that her voice was still heard on the backing track after she threw the mic prompted accusations of lip synching, as many jokingly compared her with the 1980s group Milli Vanilli. This is the latest example of performers having their shows interrupted by someone in the crowd throwing something on stage. In June, Bebe Rexha was hurt when a man threw his phone on stage, hitting her in the face. The man, named as 27-year-old Nicolas Malvagna of New Jersey, was later charged with with two counts of assault in the third degree, one count of harassment in the second degree, one count of aggravated harassment in the second degree, and one count of attempted assault in the third degree. In November, Harry Styles was hit in the eye with a sweet at a gig, and Pink looked uncomfortable when a bag of human ashes was thrown on stage while she was performing in London. Last year Cardi B admitted two offences arising from a brawl in a strip club, as part of a deal to avoid a trial and possible jail time. At the time she said \"I've made some bad decisions in my past that I am not afraid to face and own up to.\" Cardi B is best known for hits such as I Like It, Up, Bodak Yellow and WAP - a duet with Megan Thee Stallion.",

        "title": "Ukraine war: 'People call us the Ghosts of Bakhmut'",
        "content": "Ukrainian forces are trying to retake the city of Bakhmut in the country's east. The BBC was given exclusive access to a team of elite snipers, referred to as \"the Ghosts of Bakhmut\", who are conducting night raids nearby. Ghost, the sniping team's commander, takes us to the place he calls the \"edge of existence\" - their base on the outskirts of the city. \"Ghost is my call sign,\" he tells me. \"When we started bringing terror to Bakhmut, we got the name 'the Ghosts of Bakhmut'.\" Their base is already well within the range of Russian artillery. Ghost doesn't flinch at the crump of a shell landing nearby. \"The artillery always makes people worry,\" he says. \"You can hide from artillery, but not from a sniper\". The Ghosts, a team of about 20 soldiers, have been operating on the edges of Bakhmut for the past six months. They often hunt for high-value targets. I ask Ghost how many Russians his team have killed. He says, \"There's a confirmed number - 524. Seventy-six of those are mine.\" The team electronically records every shot through the sights of their rifles. Not everyone's keeping count, though. Kuzia, the marksman for tonight's mission, says: \"It's nothing to be proud of. We're not killing people, we're destroying the enemy.\" Before the war, he worked in a factory. He says he never liked guns, but felt compelled to take up arms when Russia invaded. Kuzia does one final check of his US-made Barrett sniper rifle: \"Each mission is dangerous, when we make a mistake the enemy can hit you,\" he says. \"Of course I'm scared - only a fool wouldn't be.\" On tonight's mission he'll be accompanied by Taras, his spotter. Kusch is the driver - who'll bring them as close as possible to the front line. From there the two-man team will have to walk more than a mile to reach their target. Ghost will remain back at the base, along with the rookie, known simply as the Brit. The youngest member of the team got the name after receiving his initial training in the UK. He's yet to have his first confirmed kill. Ghost says he's handpicked every member of the team based on their \"humanity and patriotism\" rather than their military experience and skills. As dusk approaches the team climbs into their armoured Humvee. I, and cameraman Moose Campbell, will accompany them to the drop-off point. Kusch, the driver, tells us that part of the route is still being targeted by Russian artillery. As he starts the engine the team all give themselves the sign of the cross. Kusch starts to play some music from his phone. He says the Ukrainian rap song gets them in the mood. But it'll also mask the sound of the shelling. At first it's hard to hear the explosions nearby because of the rattle of the Humvee, which Kusch drives at speed over pot-holed tracks. But he points to the sky several times and warns, \"incoming\". There are a few thuds nearby. We pass half a dozen wrecked Ukrainian armoured vehicles that weren't so fortunate. Kusch points to minefields on either side of the dirt track. Twenty minutes later we come to an abrupt halt close to a ruined house. The two-man sniper team open the doors and disappear towards a tree line. Kusch shouts out, \"God be with you\" before making a fast exit. As we return there's a flash of orange and a louder explosion. The Humvee starts to rattle even more. Kusch opens his door, while driving, to look behind and lets out a stream of swear words. A piece of shrapnel has shredded one of the back tyres. It's a nerve-wracking hobble back to base. When we finally return he shows us the large piece of jagged metal which tore apart the tyre. It's now dark and the shelling has subsided. Inside their base they anxiously hold on to their radios for news from the sniper team. Kusch and the Brit pace the floor. Ghost makes a phone call to his seven-year-old daughter. She's on speaker when she excitedly shouts, \"I love you daddy\". It's a brief burst of normality - but he's already taught her how to strip a gun. Seven hours later, with little sleep, it's time for the extraction. We shelter in the building while there's a volley of incendiary fire, and then make our way back into the Humvee. This time it's dark, but Kusch tries to drive from memory - avoiding turning on the headlights to attract attention. Another abrupt halt and the two-man sniper team gets back inside the Humvee. The relief is palpable when we get back to their base. Kuzia says: \"One shot, one target.\" Later they show us the video from the night-scope. They say it was a Russian machine-gunner who'd been firing at Ukrainian troops near the front line. They'll rest now until the next night's mission. Kuzia says: \"I'm happy to be back and happy that everyone's alive\". Over the past six months several of the team have been injured, including the commander Ghost. But none of them has been killed. Ghost says \"every trip may be our last, but we're doing a noble deed\". One small team of snipers won't win this war, or even take back Bakhmut. But they believe they're having an impact. Kusch says it has a psychological effect on their enemy - hunting down one Russian soldier at a time from a place that can't be seen and with a sound that can't be heard.",

        "title": "Why it's getting easier to be a single mum in China",
        "content": "Until last year it was not really possible for most unmarried women to become mothers in China - practically speaking. But a social change is under way and it is driving shifts in policy too. In her flat on the outskirts of Shanghai, Zhang Meili rocks her baby back and forth. As he gurgles away happily, she tells him that she's going to head out soon to earn money for him. After his mother goes to work, two-month-old Heng Heng will be looked after by his grandmother - who recently moved to China's largest city to help her daughter raise her child. That there is no father in Heng Heng's life would be frowned upon by many in China, especially in more conservative rural and regional areas. The belief that a child should not be brought into this world without a mother and a father is still widely held here. In Zhang Meili's case, she says she was lucky to have moved to Shanghai to run a business because being a single mother in this mega-city is much more accepted. \"I'm grateful for the tolerance of Shanghai,\" she says. \"I'm from rural Henan, an area which would have a lot of discrimination against me as a single mother.\" She became a single mum after her boyfriend's family rejected his choice of bride. They considered her position in society to be too modest. So he broke up with her - even though she was pregnant with his child. I ask her mother, Mrs Zhao, how she felt when she heard the news that her daughter, who is 25, would keep the baby. \"My feelings? I was heartbroken,\" she says. \"It's very hard to raise a kid on your own. And, in our hometown, there would be criticism from neighbours.\" Have her feelings changed now that she's a grandmother? \"Now I see him, I'm really happy,\" she says with a huge smile on her face. Zhang Meili has options that many unmarried women don't have because she runs her own small business. This gives her more independence and control over her life. Though the little massage shop she runs is still struggling post-Covid, she doesn't need to clear leave with an employer or battle for social acceptance in a workplace because she has given birth to a son who will be raised without his dad. Of course, it has not been easy for Zhang Meili to keep her business afloat during such a rocky time economically, with the added challenges of giving birth, plus knowing that - while attitudes are changing - there are still those who will look down on her. She says that none of her friends backed her decision to keep her child. They thought it would harm her chances of eventually finding a husband, and that it wasn't right for the child to grow up without a father. \"When I was pregnant, I went to the hospital alone,\" she says. \"At the time, my shop was struggling to survive and, when I looked around, I did envy the women who went there with their husbands. \"But I chose to become a single mum. I chose to have him, and I needed to get over this.\" Yet it was not only people's beliefs which made it very hard to become a single parent. Before 2016, the government effectively prohibited this from happening by stopping officials from issuing birth approval certificates, without seeing proof of marriage for the father and mother. Another problem had been the requirement for both parents' ID details to be listed in order for a child to get a hukou - the identity document which all Chinese citizens need to, for example, enrol in school. When I first came to China two decades ago, I recall unmarried women telling me that they would have no choice but to have an abortion if they became pregnant accidentally because a child could not survive in this country without all the required paperwork. Even after these rules changed, it remained virtually impossible for most unmarried women to consider having a child until last year because they could not get access to the health insurance needed to pay for the hospital, or to paid maternity leave. These two things have now supposedly changed but, in practice, an employer must apply on behalf of a staff member for the benefits to kick in - and some companies are still refusing to do it. A lawyer working on cases in this field told us she had a client whose boss at a large franchise would not facilitate her getting access to paid maternity leave. Only after she sued the company did they agree to do it. \"It really depends on the openness of the company and the awareness of employers regarding the rights of their staff,\" the lawyer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"However local policies are actually vague and sometimes companies are operating in a grey zone here.\" Some bosses don't understand that the regulations have changed, the lawyer added. Others are not keeping their knowledge up to date because they simply don't want to. They may consider single parenting to be wrong. Prof Yang Juhua from Beijing's Minzu University says that, under Chinese law, all mothers and their children should enjoy the same rights regardless of marital status. \"But, in terms of implementation, it is not smooth,\" she says. \"Why? Because many people still can't understand, and are not tolerant towards, single mothers.\" Prof Yang, an expert in demography, says the rules were set up without single mothers in mind. \"China's regulations are designed for married couples,\" she adds. \"Marriage is the pre-condition. Single parents are still a new thing here and represent a way of thinking which is very different to our traditional ethical norms\". One factor driving change for policymakers has been the country's ageing population. After decades of the one-child policy, the government would now like young couples to have more babies, but many are not answering the call, for financial reasons. They think they don't have sufficient funds to raise multiple children. Under these circumstances, if single women want to have children, those in positions of authority have decided they should be encouraged to. Visiting a cavernous exhibition centre in the south-eastern city of Hangzhou, we meet Peng Qingqing, among the toys, nappies and mountains of milk formula at a commercial fair focusing on baby products. Peng Qingqing, who runs an online sales platform, is herself heavily pregnant and unmarried, and, like Zhang Meili, she says that being a businesswoman has made this easier. \"My mum always told me that women should be more independent, confident, and strong,\" she tells us. \"I don't want to marry into another family just because of a child\". The 30-year-old says the time wasn't right for marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with her much younger boyfriend, but that she wanted to keep her baby. She says that the shifting status of women in China, especially in terms of their financial independence, has meant that choices can now be made which were not possible just a few years ago. \"Traditionally women relied on men and the family for support. As we earn more, men and women become more equal. Women can even employ people to help them,\" she says. But the vast majority of single women in China are on much lower incomes and remain beholden to the system as it is to support them. The lawyer who's been working on cases relating to women's workplace rights explains that pay during maternity leave is linked to salary. \"For grassroots single mothers their incomes are low,\" she says. \"Without proper, paid, maternity leave they could not survive. It's a very practical issue. \"These days, the government is encouraging families to have more babies. Some provinces even have financial rewards. But, for single mothers, such support is not available. It's highly discriminatory.\" Women who give birth outside of marriage can also face other forms of discrimination, she says. For those in the public service, they may not be able to get political clearance from the Communist Party (certifying that someone is a decent, loyal citizen). The absence of such official approval can mean missing out on promotions or even not getting a government job in the first place. But Prof Yang says she thinks that, as society becomes more tolerant towards unmarried mothers, such discrimination will gradually disappear. If the national government, in the future, requires local officials to more strictly enforce regulations allowing single women to become parents this might also help, she says. As for Zhang Meili, she says this should be a choice for the women themselves. I ask her what advice she would give others who find themselves in the same situation as her and she replies: \"It depends on their personal situation but, if they love kids, they should have them. \"Don't lose a child because of other people's voices or because of questions coming at you from the outside.\"",

        "title": "Canada wildfires: Border blaze forces evacuations",
        "content": "Evacuations were ongoing on both sides of the US-Canada border as dangerous wildfires continue to spread in the Pacific Northwest. US residents near Oroville in Washington state were told to leave their homes on Sunday to escape the Eagle Bluff fire. An evacuation was also ordered in the Canadian town of Osoyoos. Four people have died fighting fires during Canada's worst wildfire season on record. The American Red Cross said it set up an evacuation centre in Oroville, a town of nearly 1,700 people about four miles (6.4 km) south of the border. Osoyoos in British Columbia is a town of about 5,500 people about two miles north of the border. The fire caught some tourists off guard, including Walter Wells and his wife, who were celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary. On Saturday afternoon, he first spotted some smoke on the horizon in Osoyoos, he wasn't too concerned because it was coming from \"a fire far away in the US\", he told the BBC on Monday. The couple went out for dinner and dancing but late in the evening they looked across the water and \"we were stunned\", he said. \"There are hills just west of Osoyoos and a range of hills to the south,\" he said. \"There's this huge, massive line of orange. Fire was just cresting the hill.\" When they got back to their hotel it was under an evacuation alert. Less than a mile to the west people had been asked to leave their homes due to the threat. \"The mountain was on fire and I was terrified,\" he said. They considered leaving but decided to stay the night in the hotel. It was a sleepless one. Fire crews worked overnight and on Sunday, the couple watched water bombers working to control the blaze. But as smoke settled over the town the couple left, driving north that afternoon to stay at a family cabin. They drove 57 miles before the air was clear, Mr Wells said. Over 700 properties are under evacuation orders in and around Osoyoos. People in another 2,000 properties have been told they might have to leave on short notice. In an update on Monday, the BC Wildfire Service said the 1,450 hectare (3,600 acre) fire did not grow overnight but remained out of control. It is about two-and-a-half miles southwest of Osoyoos. More than 1,000 wildfires are currently burning across Canada, and 664 are classed as \"out of control\", according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. A third of the fires are alight in British Columbia, the country's westernmost province. Fires in eastern Canada blew huge clouds of smoke over heavily populated areas and significantly worsened air quality in eastern and central North America earlier in the year. Among the firefighters who have died while tackling the blazes was a 25-year-old who died on Friday in north-eastern British Columbia. \"I am heartbroken that another firefighter was lost protecting our communities and our province during this devastating wildfire season,\" said Bruce Ralston, the province's forests minister. So far this season, Canadian wildfires have burned more than 31 million acres of land - more than the area of Cuba. July is set to be declared the world's warmest month on record, according to scientists, and some experts think it could be the warmest month in 120,000 years. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.",

        "title": "Hangzhou Zoo: Our sun bears are real, not humans in disguise",
        "content": "A zoo in eastern China has reassured visitors its sun bears are real rather than humans in disguise, after footage of one animal standing like a person sent rumours flying online. Responding to a viral video of a bear on its hind legs, Hangzhou Zoo said people \"don't understand\" the species. Social media users had speculated that the bear could be a person in costume. Sun bears, the smallest bear species in the world, are generally the size of a large dog, the zoo says. They are an endangered species native to the rainforests of South East Asia. In the video, the sun bear is seen standing tall on the edge of its enclosure, holding its paws by its side and seemingly observing the zoo's visitors for itself. People on social media had questioned how the bear could stand so upright on slender legs, as well as the appearance of what looks to be skin bagging around its hips - some noting the similarity to those on an ill-fitting bear suit. In a post written from the perspective of a sun bear called Angela, Hangzhou Zoo said: \"Some people think I stand like a person... It seems you don't understand me very well.\" \"When it comes to bears, the first thing that comes to mind is a huge figure and astonishing power\u2026 But not all bears are behemoths and danger personified.\" The zoo, through the bear's voice, instead emphasised sun bears are \"petite, the smallest bear in the world\". Hangzhou Zoo's post notes that the bears stand around 1.3m (4ft) tall when standing up on their hind legs, which is less than half the size of grizzly bears native to North America. Visits were being arranged for reporters to see the bear on Monday, a zoo employee told AP news agency over the phone. Dr Ashleigh Marshall, an expert from Chester Zoo, says the animal in the video is \"definitely a real bear\"- although she concedes sun bears do often \"look a lot like people in their costumes\". Asked on the BBC's PM programme about the ruffled appearance of the bear's skin around its rear end, she said this is a normal and very important feature of its anatomy. The folds help protect the bears from predators, as the looseness allows the bear to \"turn around in their skin\" and fight back if a large animal like a tiger were to get hold of them, Dr Marshall explained.",

        "title": "Pro-Donald Trump group spends more than $40m on legal fees",
        "content": "The primary fundraising and political spending group supporting Donald Trump has spent more than $40m (\u00a331m) on legal fees so far this year. That money, due to be confirmed in a financial filing on Monday, has been used to defend the former president and his allies across multiple cases. It is a more than two-fold increase in Save America's spending on legal costs across 2021 and 2022 combined. As Mr Trump's legal battles intensify, the bills will only keep rising. He awaits federal trial over his alleged mishandling of classified documents, state trial over a hush-money probe in New York, and a defamation trial from writer E Jean Carroll. Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and state prosecutors in Georgia are soon expected to charge Mr Trump, 77, over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Save America is a political action committee, or PAC, founded and controlled by Mr Trump. His campaign manager Susie Wiles decides whose legal bills should be funded, according to the Washington Post. It is funding representation for Mr Trump and those drawn into the various investigations against him who have requested help from his team, the Post reported. That includes Walt Nauta, his close personal aide, and Carlos de Oliveira, the property manager at his Mar-a-Lago resort, who both face charges in the classified documents case. The campaign has called it protection from \"unlawful harassment\". Spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement that the DOJ \"has continued to go after innocent Americans because they worked for President Trump and they know they have no legitimate case\". Covering their legal fees, he said, will \"protect these innocent people from financial ruin and prevent their lives from being completely destroyed\". But the $40m sum far exceeds any other expense Save America has incurred during the 2024 presidential campaign. And footing those legal bills, for the most part, are grassroots Trump supporters from around the country, whose small-dollar contributions make up the vast majority of Save America's fundraising. After leaving office, Mr Trump claimed that the 2020 election was stolen and urged supporters for months to back him up by sending to Save America. Last year, he amassed over $100m in donations, using more than $16m to cover legal fees and about $10m on personal fees. His campaign and its supporters never proved widespread election fraud. DOJ prosecutors sought information last year about how the PAC was formed and is operated, as part of their criminal investigation into the 2020 election. At the start of his 2024 campaign, Mr Trump devoted only one cent of every dollar raised online to Save America. But earlier this year, he began diverting a larger percentage - 10 cents of every dollar - away from the campaign and toward the PAC. Jason Torchinsky, a campaign finance expert at the Holtzman Vogel Law Firm, said the candidate may be violating federal election laws by accepting donations that directly cover his legal expenses. \"It is not unprecedented for a campaign committee to pay legal fees,\" Mr Torchinsky told BBC News. \"But the issue is that Trump is a federal candidate, with a third party to pay his legal bills, that really do amount to a gift to the candidate that exceeds federal contribution limits.\" National opinion polls show Mr Trump firmly in the lead to win the Republican nomination despite his mounting legal troubles, but some of his 2024 opponents have criticised the expenditures. A spokesman for Mr Trump's chief rival, Ron DeSantis, accused him of spending this year \"on two things: falsely attacking Ron DeSantis and paying his own legal fees, not a cent on defeating Joe Biden\". \"He's going to middle class men and women in this country and they're donating $15, $25, $50, $100 because they believe in Donald Trump and they want him to be president again,\" Chris Christie, another candidate, said in a June interview on CNN. \"They're not giving that money so he can pay his personal legal fees.\" But Ohio Senator JD Vance, a Republican who has endorsed Mr Trump's latest White House bid, defended the move on Saturday. \"I have good friends who did nothing wrong who had their legal fees paid by Save America PAC,\" he said. \"Would you rather they throw all of their employees under a bus?\" There is some evidence the escalating fees are putting a strain on Mr Trump's political operation. According to the New York Times, Save America has requested a refund on a $60m contribution it made to another group supporting Mr Trump. It is unclear how much of, or even if, the money was refunded. Trump advisors are set to create a separate legal defence fund to handle legal costs for those entangled in probes of the former president, US media reported. But Mr Torchinsky, the campaign finance expert, pointed out that, unlike in the case of Save America, such a fund will not require public disclosure of what is raised and where the money is going. And with more indictments expected and preparation for trials imminent, he said: \"I would expect the fees to go up exponentially.\" \"It was $40m in the first half of the year. It wouldn't shock me if the next six months rack up $60m.\"",

        "title": "Lebanon clashes: Thousands flee violence at Palestinian refugee camp",
        "content": "The UN says more than 2,000 people have been forced to flee violence between rival factions at a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon. The clashes between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement and Islamist groups left 11 people dead, the UN says. A ceasefire has now been agreed although gunfire was still being reported on Monday. Established in 1948, the Ein el-Hilweh camp is the largest in Lebanon. The UN says it houses more than 63,000 registered refugees, but some estimates say the population is higher. The camp, situated near the southern city of Sidon, falls outside the jurisdiction of the Lebanese security forces. It is left up to rival factions within the camp to maintain its security, but factional disputes are common. The weekend's violence erupted on Saturday when a member of an Islamist group was killed, AFP news agency reports, quoting an unnamed source inside the camp. Tensions continued to mount through to Sunday, culminating with the death of a Fatah commander, Ashraf al-Armouchi, and several of his aides. A ceasefire agreed on Sunday soon broke down, and heavy fighting was again reported on Monday with gun and anti-tank fire echoing through the camp. More than 40 people were injured in the clashes, including a UN aid worker, and two schools were damaged, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said. A second ceasefire agreed on Monday after a meeting with the local MP appears to have improved the situation, although there are still reports of some gunfire. The Palestinian presidency denounced the fighting, calling the security of the camps a \"red line\". \"It is not permissible for anyone to intimidate our people and tamper with their security,\" it said in a statement. As well as the nine dead, Lebanese soldiers were also injured during the violence, the Lebanese army said. The director of the UNRWA in Lebanon, Dorothee Kraus, said all the agency's operations in the camp had been suspended. She called on \"all parties to immediately return to calm and take all measures necessary to protect civilians, including children\". More than 479,000 refugees are registered with UNRWA in Lebanon, the agency says. About half live in the country's 12 refugee camps, which have \"dire\" living conditions, it adds.

        "title": "States With the Highest Rates of Mass Shootings",
        "content": "This June, one weekend saw 11 people killed and 60 injured in mass shootings. The end of that month marked the U.S.'s deadliest six months of mass shootings in decades, and on July 22, an attack in a Houston park brought the number of mass shootings in 2023 to 400. More and more, it seems there\u2019s no place to avoid the threats they pose.  But some states are certainly more dangerous than others, at least according to a new dataset released by a team at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, which for the first time maps the geographic distribution of mass shooting incidence rates. In their study, published July 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open, the authors provide clear metrics on mass shootings in each state and the District of Columbia from 2014 through 2022. Among statistics like the numbers of shootings related to domestic violence, crime, and what the authors call \"social motivations\"\u2014like racism, religious hate, and domestic terrorism\u2014the authors provided the rate of mass shootings per capita in each state. The result, which uses data from the Gun Violence Archive, is a simple geographic distribution showing where people are most affected by mass shootings, which the study defines as an incident where four or more people, not including the shooter, are shot or killed. (There\u2019s no universally agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a mass shooting, making results like these difficult to compare across studies).   The largest, more densely populated states like California and Texas have the most mass shootings in almost any given year. But when accounting for the number of people who live in each state, however, these behemoths have nowhere near the highest rates in the country. Texas, in fact, falls right in the middle as the state with the 25th highest rate, with 1.05 shootings per 1,000,000 people. California is in 27th place.  The states with the  highest rates of large-scale gun violence are mostly clustered in the south: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina, along with Missouri. With the exception of Missouri, all of these states were also among the five with the highest rates of social-related mass shootings, including the racist 2015 attack on a Charleston church. Louisiana also had the highest rate of crime-related mass shootings, and, along with Mississippi and Missouri, also came out near the top in domestic violence-related mass shootings.  Only two states, Hawaii and North Dakota, saw no mass shootings at all in the 9 years included in the study.  Though the authors of the study didn\u2019t provide theories on why rates were higher in certain states and regions than others, the seemingly large variety in key motivations across mass shootings in the high-rate Southern states suggest that it may be worth investigating other potential common factors at play.",

The National Weather Service said a \u201cdangerous\u201d heat wave began to scorch the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Thursday and will continue into the weekend. Severe thunderstorms and flash floods are possible for parts of the Northeast and South, New England and South Florida.

The prediction for continued excessive heat comes a day after the World Meteorological Organization and the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service declared July 2023 the hottest month on record. On Thursday, heat and humidity in major cities along the East Coast, including Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City, created a real feel above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).

The Southwest and southern Plains continue to experience record-breaking heat. There, the oppressive temperatures have been blanketing the region for weeks. One meteorologist based in New Mexico called the prolonged period of temperatures over 100 degrees (37.8 C) unprecedented.

The country's largest power grid, PJM Interconnection, declared a level one energy emergency alert for its 13-state grid on Wednesday, meaning the company is concerned about its ability to provide enough electricity. \u201cPJM currently has enough generation to meet forecast demand, but operators continue to monitor the grid conditions for any changes,\u201d said Jeffrey Shields, a spokesperson for the company. PJM isn't the only electrical grid to issue such an alert. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which mostly covers states in the Midwest and Northern Plains, issued a similar alert on Thursday.

And a spokesperson for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which covers most of Texas, said they expect their grid will operate per usual during this latest blast of extreme weather across the country.",

This year, journalist Alex Wagner, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, actor Ke Huy Quan, fashion designer Anna Sui, and baseball player Shohei Ohtani all made the list, which covers industries ranging from politics to business to entertainment to fashion to sports. This is our 6th year publishing this list. And with so many Asian Pacific leaders in prominent positions around the world, it\u2019s never been harder to winnow the 100. Put simply: we\u2019re in the midst of a golden hour. But how? Why did this happen, seemingly, within only the last few years? Population growth contributes. Our diaspora in the United States nearly doubled between 2000 and 2019\u2014and buying power has, similarly, skyrocketed by 127% from 2000 to 2020. But a powerful population doesn\u2019t ensure concentrated change. Research by Gold House in 2018 with 500 of the top Asian Pacific leaders across business, culture, and activism indicated a universal prioritization of four core challenges\u2014with the first being enhancing how the media portrayed us (or didn\u2019t at all). As they say, seeing is believing. Media representation became the unifying battleground through Crazy Rich Asians, the first Asian-led major studio project in 25 years. In 2018, many studio executives did not believe that Asians were a viable market\u2014partly due to our 7% domestic population at the time. But by adapting successful galvanization models by Black churches in the late 80s and from women in the 2000s, several industry leaders jumpstarted Jon M. Chu\u2019s critically-lauded romantic comedy with a promotional engine now known as #GoldOpen, using theater buyouts and other viral tactics to guarantee that Crazy Rich Asians was a hit at the box office. Since then, #GoldOpen has ensured the opening weekend success of more than two dozen Asian-led films including, most recently, Everything Everywhere All At Once. Prioritizing market viability isn\u2019t new. Creators can come from anywhere but haven\u2019t always been able to go everywhere. Marketing has always been half the battle\u2014most easily evidenced by its percentage of total theatrical release budgets. YouTube was and continues to be the bastion for minority creators to reach the mainstream. In 2010, for instance, 25% of YouTube\u2019s top categories were Asian-led; accessible bandwidth and ubiquitous smart device distribution gave permission to niche creation. Beyond YouTube, a recent study conducted by Nielsen and Gold House indicated that streaming platforms like Netflix have twice the AANHPIs of broadcast programs. And, of course, there\u2019s K-pop, whose listening share grew 65% annually since 2015 on Spotify and Apple Music and even more during the pandemic. Alongside demonstrative distribution, the Asian Pacific diaspora won the ability to influence storytelling upstream. Through increased budgets for inclusive content development and production as well as cultural consultation practices that dismantle pernicious stereotypes, more authentic projects have flourished. This inclusive influence has accelerated due to executive greenlighting power. From Netflix (the platform\u2019s Chief Content and Marketing Officers are Asian women\u2014Bela Bajaria and Marian Lee Dicus) to a legion of studio chiefs including Albert Cheng of Amazon Prime Video, Asad Ayaz and Nancy Lee of Disney, Ramsey Naito of Paramount and Nickelodeon Animation, and Agnes Chu of Cond\u00e9 Nast Entertainment, diverse leaders have demonstrated the power and imperative of inclusive crews, casts, and colleagues for all marginalized communities. Super producers like AUM Group and Significant Productions\u2019 Nina Yang Bongiovi utilize their own outfits for enabling multicultural filmmakers who don\u2019t just create great art\u2014but great art that challenges societal canon. At conglomerates like CJ, leaders like Vice Chair Miky Lee and ENM Chief Global Officer Steve Chung and Kakao\u2019s recent majority stake in SM (creating the largest non-Western-based music label) continue to leverage inclusion and cultural specificity to commercial and critical acclaim around the world. When you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you don\u2019t just shatter that room\u2019s ceiling; you build your own house and bring everyone in. Finally, the diversification of voting bodies to include younger, even more diverse voters\u2014like The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences currently helmed by President Janet Yang\u2014has enabled films like Everything Everywhere All At Once to become the most-awarded film in history. While shiny awards may be met with ambivalence, the uptick in consumption of Academy Award-recognized films indicates that distillation for the masses is essential to break through a noisy world. As voted on by the top Asian Pacific nonprofits and our community\u2019s foremost leaders, the A100 is the definitive recognition for our community\u2019s cultural contributions. Each year, we\u2019re often asked: are there even 100 top AANHPIs to recognize? There have always been worthy AANHPIs. Now the world is actually seeing them.",

        "title": "Peace Prize Laureates Urge Allies to Help Ukraine 'Win Fast'",
        "content": "It may seem unusual for human-rights advocates to call for an escalation in a war. But that's the message three Nobel Peace Prize laureates brought to Washington this week. As the conflict in Ukraine enters a critical phase, its allies must speed the delivery of materiel, enforce harsher sanctions against Russia, and make quicker decisions, says Oleksandra Matviichuk, a Ukrainian human-rights lawyer and recipient of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize. Allies' mindset, Matviichuk tells TIME during a visit to its Washington bureau, must change from \u201cLet\u2019s help Ukraine not to fail\u201d to \u201cLet\u2019s help Ukraine to win fast.\u201d Matviichuk cast the plea in moral terms: Every day that passes in Ukraine there are more battlefield deaths and more deaths in occupied territories. \"The problem is we have no time,\" Matviichuk says. While she didn't list what specific weapons she feels are needed, Ukrainian officials have asked allies to send longer-range missiles, ramp up the deployment of jets, and speed the delivery of tanks for the Ukrainian army's ongoing counteroffensive. Matviichuk was joined on her swing through Washington by fellow Peace Prize laureate Aleksandr Cherkasov, chair of the Russian human-rights organization Memorial, and a representative of Ales Bialiatski, another Nobel laureate from Belarus, who is imprisoned for pro-democracy activism. All three insist that defeating Russia in Ukraine is a pre-requisite for bringing democracy to Russia and Belarus. The joint effort to push for more forceful military intervention in Ukraine comes as bipartisan willingness in Washington to fund the war indefinitely appears to be abating. The Republican-led House included $300 million in new funding for U.S. military support to Ukraine when it passed the National Defense Authorization Act earlier this month and sent it to the Senate. But some hardline House Republicans have pledged to strip out that money before the measure gets sent to President Biden\u2019s desk. Read More: Inside the Race to Arm Ukraine Before Its Counteroffensive. Biden has steadily ratcheted up the lethality and caliber of U.S. weaponry shipped to Ukraine. Earlier this year, the President sent M1 Abrams tanks. In May, he agreed to send modern F16 fighter jets. This month, the U.S. sent cluster munitions to Ukraine to fill an ammunition shortfall. But Biden has also been criticized, including at times by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, for moving too slowly. The steady escalation has been part of the Administration's strategy to keep NATO allies on board. Biden thinks he's \"the master of boiling the frog slowly,\" says Michael Allen, who was a senior official on President George W. Bush\u2019s National Security Council. \"Now there's overwhelming consensus even among Democrats that the President has gone way too slowly.\" In addition to sending weapons and jets, the trio of activists visiting Washington asked the Biden Administration to support bringing Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders to trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Biden had quietly ordered the government to begin sharing evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine with the ICC. The White House recently told members of Congress that Biden has approved sharing information with the ICC about Russian war crimes in Ukraine, a U.S. official tells TIME. \u201cSince the beginning of Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine, the President has been clear: there needs to be accountability for the perpetrators and enablers of war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine,\" U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. \"We support a range of international mechanisms to identify and hold accountable those responsible,\" Watson said, including the work of the ICC. Read More: Pentagon Accounting Error Means More Funding For Ukraine. A tribunal is essential to document what crimes Russian officials have committed and have a public accounting, Cherkasov tells TIME. \u201cThere is a Russian expression, \u2018To step on the same rake twice,\u2019 which means to make the same mistake over and over again,\u201d he says. Past efforts in Russia to hold human-rights violators to account for atrocities during the Soviet era have fallen far short, Cherkasov says, and \u201ctoday we understand that that would not be repealed.\u201d Defeating Putin\u2019s army on the battlefield in Ukraine would be a first step toward breaking Putin\u2019s autocratic hold on Russians, Matviichuk says, adding that Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is part of a larger effort to keep the support of the Russian people by telling them he is returning Russia to its imperialist past. \u201cThe majority of Russians still see their glory in the forcible restoration of the Russian Empire,\u201d says Matviichuk, whose organization has documented 45,000 examples of war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine. \u201cThe success of Ukraine will provide a chance for the democratic future of Russia, because it will provide the push for people to reflect that maybe it\u2019s not okay in the 21st Century to invade other countries and kill people to erode their identity\u2014maybe it\u2019s better to find our glory in something else.\u201d",

        "title": "Lindsey Horan\u2019s Anger Fuels Goal in Draw Against Netherlands",
        "content": "In the first half of the U.S. Women National Team\u2019s (USWNT) group stage matchup against the Netherlands on Wednesday night in Wellington, New Zealand, American midfielder and co-captain Lindsey Horan found herself exasperated, arms extended, since her teammates missed her open on the pitch. In the second half, Horan found herself chippy, fired up and physical, exchanging pushes with a Dutch player\u2014and pro club teammate\u2014who tackled her too hard. This time, however, Horan would take out her frustration on the soccer ball. With her head. And America averted a World Cup disaster. The game ended in a 1-1 draw: Horan\u2019s second half aerial goal, off a Rose Lavelle corner kick, deadlocked the game in the 62nd minute. The U.S. controlled the game after Horan\u2019s score, failing to convert a few opportunities but walking away with a point. (The Americans held a 17-4 advantage in attempts at goal). Both the U.S. and the Netherlands now have four points in their group. Neither team has yet clinched a place in the knockout round, the result the Americans in particular were surely expecting. Both teams have some work to do in their final group stage games. But both the Americans and the Netherlands are in a strong position to advance. Sign up for \u2018Extra Time,\u2019 our new newsletter that will break down the biggest moments from the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup The Netherlands had taken the lead early. In the 17th minute, the Dutch patiently dissected the U.S. defense and Jill Roord found herself largely unbothered near the top of the 18-yard box. Eight U.S. defenders were in the box with her. But they weren\u2019t close enough to Roord. Her angular strike went through Horan\u2019s legs\u2014she had quite an unpleasant first half\u2014and through the rest of the defense and into the net. The Americans now trailed in a World Cup game for the first time since 2011. In the 47th minute, American defender Crystal Dunn had the ball on her foot, out wide to the left. Four Netherlands players honed in on Dunn. Horan stood in the middle of the pitch, arms extended, incredulous that Dunn wasn\u2019t sending a diagonal pass her way, to push the American attack and perhaps create a much-needed scoring chance against the Dutch. Dunn sent the ball back to Naomi Garma, who also missed Horan, who put her arms out in exasperation for a second time. Dunn got the ball back and pushed it up the sideline\u2014Horan was still open. Dunn and Sophia Smith exchanged passes: Smith, who before the World Cup talked about the singular focus that overcomes her when she sniffs a scoring opportunity, dribbled into the teeth of the Netherlands defense. Horan\u2019s arms went up a third time. Smith lost possession.

For Horan and her teammates, the halftime whistle couldn\u2019t come soon enough. They all needed to regroup. And the switch flipped for the Americans after the break. First off, Lavelle entered the game and provided a spark, almost immediately earning a yellow card for an aggressive tackle. Her instant message: the U.S. would not fall flat in this half. To that end, moments later Danielle van de Donk hit Horan hard. The U.S. co-captain needed some quick treatment on the sideline. When she returned for a corner kick, Horan let van de Donk, her teammate at Lyon, know she didn\u2019t appreciate such roughness. They exchanged trash talk and pushes. The ref tried to get them to make amends. Neither was really having it. Horan, however, got the upper hand: the ensuing corner kick to shut down the chatter. Lavelle lifted the ball towards the box. \u201cRose put in an absolute dime,\u201d Horan said afterwards. Horan leapt and scored the game-tying header. Turns out that the U.S. would avert its first group stage loss since 2011, a year they reached the World Cup final but lost to Japan. When the match ended, Horan and van de Donk exchanged pleasantries and hugged. All\u2019s fair in World Cup competition: the pair could go back to being buddies now. Luckily for the Americans, however, Horan saved the sportsmanship for after the final whistle. She got full-on ticked. At just the right moment.",

        "title": "Maine Has the Lithium America Needs, But Won't Allow Mining",
        "content": "This story was published in partnership with The Maine Monitor, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news organization. To get regular coverage from the Monitor, sign up for a free Monitor newsletter here. The world\u2019s richest known lithium deposit lies deep in the woods of western Maine, in a yawning, sparkling mouth of white and brown rocks that looks like a landslide carved into the side of Plumbago Mountain. Mary Freeman and her husband Gary found the deposit five years ago while hunting for tourmaline, a striking, multi-colored gemstone found in the region. The Freemans make their living selling lab supplies through the Florida-based company they founded 40 years ago, Awareness Technology. But their true love is digging for gemstones, which has brought them for years to Mary\u2019s home state of Maine, the site of some of the best tourmaline hunting in the world. Since 2003, they\u2019ve been buying up property parcels, studying core samples and old geological maps to determine where to try digging next, then spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on blasting and equipment. The couple has dug more than a mile of tunnels in pursuit of beautiful stones, and many of their finds\u2014like blue elbaite and rich watermelon tourmaline\u2014have wound up on display at the Maine Mineral & Gem Museum in nearby Bethel. Now, the Freemans want to expand this pit, near the town of Newry, Maine, so they can mine spodumene, crystals that contain the lithium the U.S. needs for the clean energy transition. The timing of their discovery, in what has been named Plumbago North, is remarkable; the Freemans have stumbled across one of the only hard-rock sources of lithium in the U.S. at a time when the material is desperately needed for the clean energy transition. By 2040, the world will need at least 1.1 million metric tons of lithium annually, more than ten times what it currently produces, according to projections by the International Energy Agency. Should the Maine deposit be mined, it could be worth as much as $1.5 billion, a huge windfall for the Freemans and a boon to the Biden Administration\u2019s efforts to jumpstart more domestic mining, processing, and recycling of critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements to reduce the U.S.\u2019 dependence on China. This is one of the few lithium deposits in the U.S. currently found in hard rock, which means it is higher-quality and faster to process than lithium mined from brine. \u201cI consider myself an environmentalist,\u201d says Mary, who on a recent rainy visit to the test quarry, was wearing jeans, a sweater, and hiking boots, her white hair pulled into a low ponytail. Most of the country\u2019s critical minerals are mined elsewhere and processed in China, she adds. \u201cI think [the U.S.] should try to be a little bit more self-sufficient.\u201d Read more: Lithium Is Key to the Electric Vehicle Transition. It\u2019s Also in Short Supply But like just about everywhere in the U.S. where new mines have been proposed, there is strong opposition here. Maine has some of the strictest mining and water quality standards in the country, and prohibits digging for metals in open pits larger than three acres. There have not been any active metal mines in the state for decades, and no company has applied for a permit since a particularly strict law passed in 2017. As more companies begin prospecting in Maine and searching for sizable nickel, copper, and silver deposits, towns are beginning to pass their own bans on industrial mining. \u201cThis is a story that has been played out in Maine for generations,\u201d says Bill Pluecker, a member of the state\u2019s House of Representatives, whose hometown of Warren\u2014a 45-minute drive from the capital city of Augusta\u2014recently voted overwhelmingly in favor of a temporary ban on industrial metal mining after a Canadian company came looking for minerals near a beloved local pond. \u201cWe build industries based on the needs of populations not living here and then the bottom drops out, leaving us struggling again to pick up the pieces.\u201d Mainers often invoke the Callahan Mine in the coastal town of Brooksville as a warning. Tailings from the mine, which operated for several years in the late 1960s, were disposed of in a pile next to a salt marsh and creek. The former mine is now a Superfund site, and a 2013 study by researchers at Dartmouth College found widespread evidence of toxic metals in nearby sediment, water and fish. Cleanup costs, borne by taxpayers, are estimated between $23 million and $45 million. \u201cOur gold rush mentality regarding oil has fueled the climate crisis,\u201d says State Rep. Margaret O\u2019Neil, who presented a bill last session that would have halted lithium mining for five years while the state worked out rules (the legislation ultimately failed). \u201cAs we facilitate our transition away from fossil fuels, we must examine the risks of lithium mining and consider whether the benefits of mining here in Maine justify the harms.\u201d The Freemans\u2019 point out that they plan to dig for the spodumene, then ship it out of state for processing, so there would be no chemical ponds or tailings piles. They liken the excavation of the minerals to quarrying for granite or limestone, which enjoys a long, rich history in Maine. Advocates for mining in the U.S. argue that, since the country outsources most of its mining to places with less strict environmental and labor regulations, those harms are currently being born by foreign residents, while putting U.S. manufacturers in the precarious position of depending on faraway sources for the minerals they need. Though there are more than 12,000 active mines in the U.S., the bulk of them are for stone, coal, sand, and gravel. There is only one operational lithium mine in the U.S., in Nevada, and one operational rare earth element mine, in Mountain Pass, Calif., meaning that the U.S. is dependent on other countries for the materials essential for clean energy technologies like batteries, wind turbines, and solar panels. Even after they\u2019re mined, those materials currently have to be shipped to China for processing since the U.S. does not have any processing facilities. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about critical metals and materials, we\u2019re so far behind that it\u2019s crazy,\u201d says Corby Anderson, a professor at the Colorado School of Mines. \u201cIt\u2019s the dichotomy of the current administration\u2014they have incentives for electric vehicles and all these things, but they need materials like graphite, manganese, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and copper. The only one we mine and refine in this country is copper.\u201d The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the problems of faraway supply chains; as U.S. consumers shopped online in their homes, the goods they bought, mostly from Asia, experienced lengthy delays at clogged ports. What\u2019s more, diplomatic tensions with China motivated the U.S. government to seek other potential sources for mining, material processing, and recycling. That\u2019s why, in the pandemic\u2019s aftermath, the Biden Administration launched an initiative to secure a Made in America supply chain for critical minerals. It included billions in funding for companies trying to mine and process critical minerals domestically. The rocks in Plumbago North would seem to help provide a domestic supply chain for critical minerals; they are thought to be among the largest specimens of spodumene ever found, with crystals of such high quality that in addition to batteries, they could be used to make scientific glassware or computer screens, where the lithium metal would help lower the melting temperature. The Freemans are just two of the hundreds of people prospecting for critical materials across the country as the U.S. tries to strengthen the domestic supply chain. According to an analysis by Patrick Donnelly, the Great Basin Director for the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit environmental organization, more than 100 companies have staked claims for lithium deposits in the American West. Companies also have applied for permits to mine cobalt in Idaho, nickel and copper in Minnesota, and lithium in North Carolina. Geologists say there\u2019s also likely a lot more lithium in spodumene deposits across New England. Communities that haven\u2019t had working mines in years may soon find themselves a key source for lithium and other minerals needed for car batteries, solar panels, and many of the objects people will need more of to transition themselves off polluting fossil fuels. There are good reasons for U.S. communities to have healthy skepticism about mining projects; there is no shortage of examples of a company coming into a community, mining until doing so becomes too expensive, then leaving a polluted site for someone else to clean up. There are more than 50,000 abandoned mines in the western United States alone, 80% of which still need to be remediated. Passage of landmark environmental laws like the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Clean Water Act of 1972 hasn\u2019t made mining safe enough, environmentalists say. \u201cAll mines pollute in one way or another, and mines are really bad at predicting how much they\u2019re going to pollute,\u201d says Jan Morrill, who studies mining at the environmental group Earthworks, which recently found that 76% of mining companies in the U.S. polluted groundwater after saying they wouldn\u2019t. One of the most problematic parts of mines is the tailings, or waste, Morrill says: Companies extract the minerals they need, then are left with a giant pile of rock, liquid, and chemicals that they store in ponds or behind dams that sometimes prove unstable. These tailings have caused landslides, excessive dust, and water pollution; more than 300 mine tailing dams have failed worldwide over the last century, according to Christopher Sergeant, a research scientist at the University of Montana. It is not uncommon for tailings to leak into water, in fact, there is a permit that mine owners can get in case they find their projections were wrong and they need to discharge into U.S. waters. Even \u201cmodern mines\u201d that adhere to the latest U.S. standards\u2014which are among the strictest in the world\u2014still pollute, Earthworks has found. Though there are, theoretically, non-polluting ways to store mine tailings, doing so is much more expensive and mine operators have largely not paid to do so, Morrill says. That\u2019s because, says Aimee Boulanger, executive director of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, \u201claws and markets have not fully incentivized companies to do that.\u201d Indeed, the Biden initiative to increase domestic mining includes, for example, a $700 million loan for Ioneer, a company planning a lithium mine on Rhyolite Ridge in Nevada, where environmental groups say the mine, as proposed, would cause the extinction of an endangered species called Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat. The Administration is also spending $115 million to help Talon Nickel build a battery minerals processing facility in North Dakota, but the potential mine they would source from, in Minnesota, is opposed by Indigenous groups and environmentalists who fear it could contaminate wells in the area. Still, the U.S. has a more rigorous regulatory environment than many other countries, she says, and there are domestic mines that even some environmentalists support, like the Stillwater Mine in Montana. Community organizations there signed a Good Neighbor Agreement in 2000 with the Sibanye-Stillwater Mining Company allowing the firm to extract platinum and palladium\u2014while also establishing clear and enforceable water standards, restrictions to minimize local traffic, and third-party auditors to ensure the mine adheres to the standards it set out. The mine is now one of the top employers and private-sector income generators in Montana. But advocates had to force the Agreement; three grassroots organizations sued to stop the construction of the mine, and after a year of negotiations, the mining company and grassroots groups agreed to the contract instead of going to court. With support from elected officials trying to find ways to mine more critical minerals in the U.S., companies may not feel the need to make similar promises to the local community. Read more: What Would Happen if South America Formed an OPEC for Lithium Environmental concerns aren\u2019t the only problem with mining, Morrill says. The history of mining in the U.S. is linked to colonialism; Christopher Columbus was looking for gold when he stumbled across North America, and as Europeans expanded into the continent, they took land from Indigenous people to mine for gold, silver, and other metals. Today, mining in the U.S. often encroaches on Indigenous land. Under mining laws in the U.S. that date to 1872, anyone can stake a claim on federal public lands and apply for permits to start mining if they find \u201cvaluable\u201d mineral deposits there. Most lithium, cobalt, and nickel mines are within 35 miles of a Native American reservation, Morrill says, largely because in the aftermath of the 1849 gold rush, the U.S. military removed tribes to reservations not far from mineral deposits in the West. In one particularly controversial project, the mining company Rio Tinto wants to build a copper mine on Oak Flat, Ariz., a desert area adjacent to an Apache reservation that Indigenous groups have used for centuries to conduct cultural ceremonies.  Yet fears about the effects of climate change are escalating the pressure on local communities to get out of the way of mines, says Thea Riofrancos, an associate professor of political science at Providence College who studies mining and the green energy transition. She and other scholars have questioned whether projections that the world will face lithium shortages by 2025 are accurate; recycling more batteries and transitioning away from private vehicles to more public transportation, for example, could reduce our long-term need for lithium-ion energy storage. \u201cWe should think about what is driving this demand, why does this rush feel so intensive, why is there not a version where we are going to try and do this transition with the least amount of mining possible?\u201d Riofrancos says. Most environmentalists agree that the 1872 mining law needs to be updated and there are several bills in Congress that would do so. The Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act of 2023, for example, introduced by Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) in May, would require more tribal consultation and change how mining is approved on federal lands. Finding a way to mine in the U.S. could help address a moral quandary, that we consume these materials but ask other countries to bear the brunt of their extraction, says Boulanger, with IRMA. \u201cThere\u2019s an argument to be made that if we\u2019re going to use these materials, and we live in the most consumptive country in the world, we shouldn\u2019t be making other countries be the bank account of our natural resources,\u201d she says. If lawmakers and regulators can\u2019t agree on how to mine on U.S. soil, it could leave the U.S. susceptible to essentially outsourcing its mining problems to less-regulated countries. For example, last October, the Department of Energy used the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to give a $141.7 million grant to Piedmont Lithium, which is building a plant in Tennessee to expand U.S. supply of lithium hydroxide, used in long-range batteries for electric vehicles. In March, Blue Orca Capital, a hedge fund, said it was \u201cshorting,\u201d or betting against the stock of Piedmont Lithium, alleging that the spodumene the firm plans to refine into lithium at its Tennessee facility was guaranteed by bribes to the son of a high-level politician in Ghana\u2014\u201cbecause of corruption,\u201d those raw materials are likely to never come to fruition, the hedge fund says. Piedmont denies the allegations and says in a statement provided to TIME that the Minerals Income Investment Fund of Ghana told the company that it has valid licenses and permits for all its current activities. Most of the proposed critical materials mines in the U.S. are not near a big population center\u2014or economic activity, and some communities are in favor of a mine for the jobs it would create. But the proposed locations could instead lead to situations where sparsely populated communities don\u2019t learn about a planned mine until it\u2019s too late to stop it. \u201cIt can feel really fast\u2014all of a sudden an enormous project is being proposed next door to you, it took years for the company to prospect but you didn\u2019t hear about it \u2018til now,\u201d says Riofrancos. The Freemans\u2019 mine is not one of these projects. Though it is five miles from the nearest town, Maine is going through an extensive review process to decide whether to let the couple keep digging. Earlier in 2023, there were seven bills in the legislature regarding the potential of mining lithium in Maine. Lawmakers ultimately settled on legislation that may open the door to extracting the Freemans\u2019 lithium by allowing larger open pit metal mines, so long as developers can prove they won\u2019t pollute groundwater and the local environment. But the new law will require changing the state\u2019s mining regulations, which may mean it could be years before the couple is able to start digging in earnest. The Freemans say their mine would not pollute the surrounding land and water, as the chemical composition of the crystals and the rocks around them is such that they would not dissolve into dangerous acid when exposed to air and water. Geologists that TIME/Maine Monitor spoke with agree with that assessment. Further, the crystals, says Mary, would be shipped out of state in large chunks for processing, so there would be no chemical ponds or tailings. Many geologists agree that the Freemans\u2019 proposal would not be as disruptive as other proposed mines across the country. Other metals (like nickel, silver, and zinc) typically occur in bands of rock deep below the surface that contain iron sulfides, which create sulfuric acid when exposed to air and water, polluting waterways for decades, a phenomenon known as acid mine drainage. Some spodumene crystals at Plumbago North, by contrast, have been naturally exposed to air and water for hundreds of millions of years and not broken down. On a visit to the test quarry this spring, Gary Freeman pointed out one large piece of spodumene lying at the bottom of a nearby brook, the water over it rushing fast and clear, not the rusty orange of an acid-contaminated stream. (The waterway is known, fittingly, as Spodumene Brook.) \u201cThe water is so good Poland Spring wants to bottle it and sell it,\u201d says Mary. Still, Morrill, of Earthworks, says there\u2019s just not enough research about the effects of hard rock spodumene mining to say for sure that the mine wouldn\u2019t harm the environment. Since so many people in Maine depend on recreation and tourism for their livelihoods, she says, it makes the most sense to keep protective regulations in place. Maine\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection has rejected the Freemans\u2019 request to consider the land a quarry, and is instead classifying spodumene as a metallic mineral. As the law stands, the Freemans will have to apply for permits under Maine\u2019s 2017 Metallic Mineral Mining Act, a costly process (the application processing fee alone is $500,000) that would take years. Meanwhile, the local community is divided. After all, in Maine it\u2019s not difficult to find people still living with the long-term damage of older mines. On the other hand, many Mainers are pragmatic and understand the state has long, dark winters, and will need battery storage for any renewable energy it generates on sunny or windy days. The alternative is to continue relying on fossil fuels, which would exacerbate climate change.

He was raised in Union, where a groundswell of opposition has formed to resist a proposal by Canada-based Exiro Minerals to look for nickel near a beloved local pond. Felch isn\u2019t thrilled with the prospect, but also knows we can\u2019t continue to be so detached from the minerals we use in our daily life. \u201cI love the place where I grew up and I wouldn\u2019t want anything to ever happen to it,\u201d says Felch. But \u201cyou need mineral resources. Most people were probably texting \u2018stop the mine\u2019 with a nickel cobalt battery in their phones.\u201d",

        "title": "Racism Is Not a Mental Illness\u2014But It\u2019s Complicated",
        "content": "Everyone knows that Law & Order plotlines are often, as they say, ripped from the headlines. But Dr. Alvin Poussaint, 88, knows this on another level: An emeritus professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, he has had the unusual experience of seeing his ideas incorporated into a season 12 episode of the long-running show. In it, a white working stiff murders a Black CEO in a dispute over a New York City taxicab. When the trial begins, a respected Black psychiatrist takes the stand to present his idea that the defendant suffers from \u201cextreme racism,\u201d a mental illness. His lawyers argue that extreme racism has such a complete hold on the defendant that it mitigates their client\u2019s legal responsibility for the murder. In the final moments, the audience is encouraged to feel that it\u2019s a victory for justice, for law and order, when the jury rejects the psychiatrist\u2019s ideas, Poussaint tells me with a tinge of disdain. In the real world, Poussaint was that psychiatrist. Sort of. While he never brought his ideas to the witness stand inside the New York City courthouse behind those massive stone steps that Law & Order made famous, in 1999 he shared his theories on the link between mental health and extreme forms of bigotry on the op-ed pages of the New York Times. In doing so, he helped set off a debate that ended with the American psychiatric establishment publicly rejecting the concept\u2014partly on the grounds that so many people are racists. But even now, after nearly a decade during which the number of hate crimes has steadily increased, the question of the relationship between bigotry and mental illness has never fully been resolved. In fact, recent high-profile incidents have made public perception of that dynamic perhaps as muddled as ever. The issue comes up in relation to everything from major mass shootings to pop-culture discourse. The racist attack at a Buffalo, N.Y., supermarket, for which the gunman pleaded guilty this week to state murder and domestic terrorism charges, prompted calls for the country to \u201cget serious about mental health\u201d as well as pleas not to talk about the shooting as a matter of psychiatric illness rather than a racist hate crime. Read more: Anti-Black Violence Has Long Been the Most Common American Hate Crime\u2014And We Still Don\u2019t Know the Full Extent It\u2019s hard to distinguish what psychiatric experts have decided not to define, to separate what Poussaint calls \u201ceveryday racism\u201d\u2014covering the span from systemic discrimination to microaggressions\u2014from the extreme version, which he and others have described as the point at which bigotry so deeply shapes behavior that a person struggles to function and sometimes becomes dangerous. But the question is more than just a thought experiment. If extreme racism were to become accepted as a mental illness per se, more suspects in hate-crime cases could potentially have recourse to mount \u201cinsanity\u201d defenses in court. And given all the mass shootings and disturbing public events in which extreme racism appears to have played some part since Poussaint first described his ideas, it\u2019s also hard not to wonder. Might developing a research-backed extreme-racism diagnosis\u2014and sound treatments\u2014have saved lives? Though the FBI typically releases data each fall detailing the prior year\u2019s hate-crimes statistics, the agency has not yet done so in 2022. But social conditions are rife, experts say, for the increase to continue. (In 2020, the most recent year for which FBI data is available, the agency reported 8,263 incidents\u2014an increase of nearly a thousand over the prior year, despite 452 fewer agencies reporting\u2014and most experts believe the real number is higher.) Police have noted that 47 out of 100 people arrested for hate crimes in New York City in early 2022 \u201chave prior documentation of an [emotionally disturbed person] incident.\u201d So the stakes are high for the nation\u2019s courtrooms to respond to the trauma unleashed by that dynamic\u2014and for Americans to decide what constitutes a just outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d says Sander Gilman, a historian at Emory University who researches the relationship between health, science, law, and society, and who has long taught a course on extremism. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to start with two things that I call Gilman\u2019s Law: not all racists are crazy, but crazy people can be racists.\u201d Thanks in part to the influence of pop culture\u2014not least those TV police procedurals\u2014many assume that insanity pleas are common. In reality, mental-health defenses are rare, and even more rarely lead to reduced punishment. Mounting that kind of defense requires time and significant resources to gather evidence and expert testimony, so in practice it is not an avenue available to all defendants. In England and the U.S., courts began to reliably consider the mental health of defendants only in the 19th century. The M\u2019Naghten rule, a standard for determining a defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of a crime, was established in 1840s England. It holds that only the sane can be held responsible for their actions. As a result, the question of mental fitness\u2014sufficient sanity to participate meaningfully in one\u2019s own defense\u2014is sometimes evaluated before a trial. (Whether the state has an obligation or right to treat such an illness in order for the person to then stand trial is, Gilman says, a question that goes back as far as the idea of such a defense.) Once a competency decision has been made, the accused who do go to trial have the right to a defense. In some cases, that may include an option for a jury to find the defendant not guilty by reason of mental disorder. In others, ideas about the mental health of the defendant may more informally shape what evidence is presented. But so-called \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d defenses are used in only about 1% of cases, says Michael Boucai, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law and an expert on mental health and other social issues in courtrooms. Those defenses are successful in even fewer cases; in fact, such a tactic often backfires or results in a defendant confined for a longer term inside a hospital than that person would have spent in prison, sometimes with no end date. And even rarer\u2014though not unheard of\u2014is an attempt to use racism or other bigotry as an indicator of mental-health challenges, he says. \u201cI think it would be extremely hard,\u201d says Boucai, \u201cI mean extremely hard, to succeed on the theory that extreme racism per se\u2014particularly subscription to a theory\u2014is a mental illness for the purpose of criminal responsibility. Just because you have a psychologist or psychiatrist saying this person is mentally ill does not mean the law has to [accept] that.\u201d (Nor does the defendant: Dylann Roof, the white man who shot and killed nine Black worshippers inside a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015\u2014whose legal team used words like \u201cdelusional,\u201d \u201cabnormal,\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d to describe their client\u2014rejected advice from his lawyers to attempt to avoid the death penalty by allowing them to argue that he was insane or suffering from a mental defect at the time of the shooting.) Some fear that raising mental-health issues in court runs the risk of bolstering inaccurate myths about the mentally ill. In reality, mentally ill people are disproportionately more likely to become the victims of crime, and most do nothing to victimize others. And, as has been observed after so many headlinemaking crimes, suspects from privileged groups are more likely to have their actions described as illness in need of treatment instead of criminal evil meriting punishment. Some experts fear that shifting the conversation to questions of mental health can also draw attention away from hateful ideas embraced by the person accused of the crime\u2014ideas that are today often shared by people, including public figures, whose mental health is not questioned. That\u2019s how important social problems that require the nation\u2019s attention are transformed into one individual\u2019s medical problems, says W. Carson Byrd, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. Column: We Need to Take Action to Address the Mental Health Crisis in This Pandemic That line of thinking is particularly problematic in a culture prone to dismiss the need for systemwide reforms to address inequality, Byrd says. It can foster an emphasis on quick fixes for the world\u2019s long-standing problems with bigotry. (In 2012, for example, a team of British researchers announced that an existing heart and blood-pressure drug appeared to reduce implicit bias after a study involving just 36 subjects.) \u201cWhite supremacy is a very normal part of society,\u201d says Byrd, who is also the faculty director of research initiatives at his university\u2019s National Center for Institutional Diversity. It is not a good or productive part of society, he points out, but a deeply entrenched one. \u201cOne of the detriments of trying to look at racism as a form of psychopathology or mental illness is that it makes that [illness] abhorrent, as if everything else is working in a certain [non-racist] way.\u201d Research has also long shown that bigotry is not an inborn human trait, but rather something learned from our environments, Byrd says. While racism can influence one\u2019s mental health, describing racism itself\u2014even \u201cextreme racism\u201d\u2014as a mental illness implies that bigotry exists beyond our individual and collective control. \u201cBy medicalizing [extreme racism], making it something curable, a mental-health disorder, it pulls away from having those broader conversations about how society is impacting people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just try to figure out, \u2018How do we fix this one person?\u2019\u201d This problem, Boucai notes, can already be clearly seen in discussions about gun crime, and mass shootings in particular: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to understand these crimes and the discourse of insanity provides one way to do it,\u201d says Boucai. \u201cBut I think we can see where that sort of language is irresponsible and potentially undermines a just result.\u201d In other words, if a mass shooter is simply insane, then wholesale gun-law reform can, to some, seem unnecessary, even unwise. When bigotry is involved, that supposed insanity might, some who oppose Poussaint\u2019s ideas believe, undermine systemwide efforts toward equity\u2014or at least toward greater safety for those most likely to be targeted. In 1999, when Poussaint wrote his op-ed advocating for increased research into possible psychiatric treatments for extreme racism, he was the author of acclaimed books about the effects of racism on Black mental health and a veteran of public controversy. Years earlier he\u2019d argued publicly that racial pride among Black Americans could be taken to an unhealthy extreme. By the 1990s, he may have been best known for his work with Bill Cosby, consulting on scripts for The Cosby Show in a massively popular effort to disrupt stereotypes. Poussaint first published his ideas about extreme racism weeks after a man named Buford O. Furrow Jr. shot and seriously injured four children and an adult inside a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, then shot and killed a nearby Asian-American postal worker. When captured and ultimately convicted, Furrow told investigators his actions had been motivated by hate. Reporters unearthed information indicating that Furrow had close relationships with known white nationalists, and also that he had been evaluated by Washington State\u2019s mental-health system only months before the attack. He\u2019d even told officials after a previous arrest for assault that he\u2019d \u201cfantasized,\u201d about mass murder. To Poussaint, this story signaled a growing threat posed by a failure to recognize that, while highlighting and combating systemic racism is important in preventing discrimination, so is identifying and helping individuals motivated by bigotry who might go so far as to injure or kill others. Read more: 11 People Were Killed in 48 Hours in Mass Shootings Across America. It\u2019s Likely to Get Worse The idea had been brewing for years. In 1993, a Jamaican immigrant named Colin Ferguson had shot and killed six people and injured 19 aboard a New York commuter train after years of personal struggles that he blamed on white and Asian people, whom he referred to as \u201cdevils.\u201d Ferguson had been pinned down by passengers on the train to stop the shooting but, while defending himself at trial, he argued that someone else committed the crime. (Ferguson\u2019s lawyers had planned to argue that he was insane at the time, suffering from something called \u201cBlack rage,\u201d another condition debated but not officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and that was the subject of a Law & Order episode.) After the train shootings, Poussaint\u2014a Haitian-American son of immigrants\u2014had noted Ferguson\u2019s trajectory: racist thinking, delusions that had come to dominate his life, then mass violence. This was a textbook case of extreme racism. \u201cExtreme racism crosses the line and is out of control,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust like somebody can have a little bit of anxiety, but if they have anxiety to the point that it is immobilizing, then it is a mental disorder.\u201d Mass shooters behind hate crimes are, as he sees it, in a similar state: \u201c[They] weren\u2019t functioning individuals. They were impaired by their mental pathology.\u201d When the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the guide that mental-health professionals use to make their diagnoses, was published in 1980, clinicians like Poussaint considered racism\u2014not extreme racism, but what he calls everyday racism\u2014a potential symptom of several conditions, from paranoid personality disorder to generalized anxiety disorder. Racism alone is not sufficient to diagnose a patient with one of those conditions, but an extreme racist, Poussaint says, likely suffers from delusions. Such people live with multiple symptoms including paranoia; they are likely to project negative traits or outcomes onto entire groups and sustain those beliefs even in the face of strong countervailing evidence. Many embrace conspiracy theories. Some may grow violent. In fact, Poussaint argued in a 2002 Western Journal of Medicine article, the extreme racist often begins with \u201cverbal expression of antagonism, progresses to avoidance of members of disliked groups, then to active discrimination against them, to physical attack, and finally to extermination (lynchings, massacres, genocide). That fifth point on the scale, the acting out of extermination fantasies, is readily classifiable as delusional behavior.\u201d Poussaint was not the first person to raise the idea that extreme racism is itself a mental illness. But he was among those leading the call for the American Psychiatric Association, publishers of the DSM, to consider putting it in subsequent editions of the manual, which has a long history of evolving, often slowly, in response to research and norms. When his op-ed ran, it seemed to Poussaint, people pounced. Some of his fellow Black psychiatrists argued that such a diagnosis would unleash a wave of legal excuse-making, helping no one but the violent racists themselves. Poussaint counters that other health diagnoses have yet\u2014nearly 200 years after psychological concerns officially entered American courtrooms\u2014to produce rafts of acquittals. And some clinicians and researchers argued that there are other ways of attacking racism besides treating it as an illness\u2014educational programs, diversity initiatives, policy changes. That\u2019s a point Poussaint says he doesn\u2019t oppose, at least when it comes to everyday racism. Those steps can help racists who embrace repugnant ideas while remaining functional parts of society. But those aren\u2019t the people he\u2019s talking about. \u201cRacism negatively impacts public health,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association told TIME in a statement. \u201cThe American Psychiatric Association has been focusing on this in the DSM by identifying and addressing the impact of structural racism on the over- or underdiagnosis of mental disorders in certain ethno-racial groups. From time to time we have received proposals to create a diagnosis of extreme racism but they have not met the criteria identified for creating new disorders.\u201d To this day, Poussaint believes that extreme racism is very likely its own disorder in need of study, possible diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment, he told me in September from his home in Massachusetts. But after retiring about 2\u00bd years ago at the age of 86, he says he\u2019s too far out of the professional mix to continue to push for an extreme racism diagnosis. I ask Poussaint what he thinks might have happened if extreme racism had become its own diagnosable condition listed in the DSM. Extreme racism might have been a topic on talk shows and a more frequent topic of news coverage, he says. With research and public information campaigns, the need for intervention could have been as clear as it is for heart attacks; the steps to do so as well-known as CPR. \u201cWe\u2019d get away from treating it as if [extreme racism] is normative,\u201d Poussaint says, \u201clike a cultural difference because America is a racist country. We have made it normative by not calling it what it is. Even people in general society, friends and relatives and even the afflicted individual, would recognize it as a disorder and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alright.\u2019 People who get swept up by anxiety and can\u2019t function, they don\u2019t think they are normal. They say, \u2018This is taking over my life. I need some help.\u2019 [A diagnosis] clues the family to say, \u2018This person is really troubled and we have to get them some help.\u2019\u201d \u2014with reporting by Solcyre Burga, Mariah Espada and Simmone Shah",

        "title": "Alex Morgan Is Entering Her Fourth World Cup in Top Form",
        "content": "Alittle more than a year ago, Alex Morgan felt out of the national-team loop. This was an unsettling position for the star American forward, who\u2019s scored 115 goals\u2014the fifth-most in U.S. history\u2014during her international career. She\u2019s a player who, along with Megan Rapinoe, has been the face of the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team (USWNT) for more than a decade. But Morgan didn\u2019t perform at her usual level at the pandemic-marred 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Spending 35 days away from her then one-year-old daughter, Charlie, taxed her mind. The Americans fell to Canada in the semis and won bronze. Morgan did not attend the last national-team training camp of that year. She wasn\u2019t on the roster for the first few camps of 2022. She\u2019d have to prove her worth all over again. But at 32, not 22. Sign up for \u2018Extra Time,\u2019 our new newsletter that will break down the biggest moments from the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup Then, during the 2022 National Women\u2019s Soccer League season, Morgan exploded. Playing for the expansion San Diego Wave FC, in a comfortable city where she and her husband, pro soccer player Servando Carrasco, plan on settling, Morgan, now 34, won the Golden Boot as the league\u2019s top goal scorer. She netted 15 goals in 17 games. It was her career best. So Morgan\u2019s entering this World Cup, her fourth, in top form. \u201cI know what to expect a little bit more now,\u201d she told TIME Studios for an upcoming Netflix documentary about the team. \u201cIn previous World Cup preps, I probably would be overstressed on things, like what I was eating, what I was doing every single day, how many hours of sleep I was getting. Every little detail. Of course these details matter. But I\u2019m not getting on myself about the little things. If I don\u2019t do something perfect, it\u2019s OK.\u201d \u201cOne thing that is different for Alex than the Olympics is that she had a lot more time to spend with the team,\u201d says USWNT coach Vlatko Andonovski. Morgan had taken some time off after giving birth to Charlie in May 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the typical training schedules. \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes for the players to get back into the rhythm, get back in the environment,\u201d says Andonovski. \u201cAnd I think in some ways, it wasn\u2019t fair for Alex before the Olympics. When she\u2019s on the field, she\u2019s comfortable in the environment. She\u2019s been in this environment longer than most players. So I think that we\u2019re going to see the best of Alex this summer.\u201d Morgan agrees with her coach. For one, she believes motherhood has helped her game. \u201c[Parenthood] just makes me feel more balanced all around,\u201d she told PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019m able to give everything to the sport and my teams, but when I go home, I\u2019m not dwelling on whether I had a bad training or bad game. I just have to be a mom and tend to my child\u2019s needs instead of overanalyzing things.\u201d Read More: A Viral French Ad Shows How Women\u2019s Soccer Can Be Just as Exciting as Men\u2019s Charlie also forced Morgan to adjust her tactics. \u201cComing back from giving birth was really hard,\u201d she told TIME Studios. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel super quick or super fast right away. I had already adapted my game to kind of finding the ball, and finding spaces in different ways without having to use my speed. So by the time my speed did come back from pregnancy, I was able to mesh the two together a little bit more. I feel like I\u2019m finding myself in good goal-scoring positions more frequently than I ever have before.\u201d As evidenced by her Golden Boot. While Morgan will be expected to shoulder a scoring load in New Zealand and Australia, she\u2019ll also have to guide younger players\u2014like fellow forwards Trinity Rodman, 21, Sophia Smith, 22 and Alyssa Thompson, 18\u2014through their first World Cup experience. \u201cEvery day in camp, Alex is always taking me under her wing,\u201d says Smith. \u201cHelping me, explaining things to me. She\u2019s someone that I\u2019ve looked up to my whole life. I can watch how she goes through life and learn from it, day in and day out.\u201d Rather than feel threatened by the rising stars, Morgan admires them. \u201cThey\u2019re owning where they are,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cThe confidence I\u2019ve seen from these young players is unmatched.\u201d Read More: 5 Controversies to Know About Ahead of the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup She\u2019s looking forward to her first World Cup as a mom. Charlie will make the trip. \u201cShe really wants to go swimming all day every day,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cI have to break it to her that it\u2019s winter\u201d in Australia and New Zealand. Crystal Dunn\u2019s son, Marcel, 1, will also fly to the World Cup, while Julie Ertz\u2019s son, Madden, who turns 1 in August, traveled with the team to New Zealand. While Morgan\u2019s still got plenty to accomplish on the pitch, she\u2019s also thinking about her legacy. Supporting moms in sports is top of mind. \u201cWe have three moms on the roster going to the World Cup,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cThat\u2019s a testament to the support that we\u2019ve gotten from this team, the federation, from the NWSL, from our sponsors. That\u2019s not the case around the world. And we\u2019re trying to make a stand for it and show that the amount of support that you get is necessary in order to compete at the highest level.\u201d",

        "title": "Kremlin drone: Zelensky denies Ukraine attacked Putin or Moscow",
        "content": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied his country carried out an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin, which Russia says was an attempt on President Vladimir Putin's life. \"We don't attack Putin or Moscow. We fight on our territory. We are defending our villages and cities,\" he said, speaking on a visit to Finland. The Russian president's office said defences downed two drones overnight. It threatened to retaliate when and where it considered necessary. Unverified footage circulating online shows smoke rising over the Kremlin - a large government complex in central Moscow - early on Wednesday. A second video shows a small explosion above the site's Senate building, while two men appear to clamber up the dome. The Russian presidency said Ukraine had attempted a strike on Mr Putin's residence in the Kremlin and described it as \"a planned terrorist act and an assassination attempt on the president\". Officials said two drones targeting the complex had been disabled using electronic radar assets, adding that President Putin had not been in the complex at the time of the alleged attack. But Ukraine has said the Russian accusations are merely a pretext for massive attacks on its territory and the US says it is treating the Russian claims with a lot of caution. Mr Putin appears to be one of the most closely-guarded leaders in the world. At Putin events in Moscow attended by BBC journalists, extremely tight security has been in place, including extensive checks and long convoys of vehicles with airspace closed and traffic halted. However if what the Kremlin is saying is true, it will raise questions about how well protected the president really is. There will also be scrutiny over the effectiveness of Russian air defences. In recent months, anti-aircraft systems have been spotted on Moscow rooftops in the vicinity of key buildings. They have been placed there because the Kremlin is concerned that Ukraine, or those sympathetic to Ukraine, may attempt to carry out aerial attacks on high-value targets. Whatever actually happened on Wednesday morning, the question now is how Russia will respond. Some officials have already called for tough action. Russian generals have warned many times of harsh responses to any strikes on Russian territory. But it is unclear whether Russia has the capacity to carry out meaningful retaliatory strikes, or whether this incident will lead to any significant escalation on the battlefield inside Ukraine. A Ukrainian presidential adviser told the BBC the incident indicated Russia could be \"preparing a large-scale terrorist provocation\" in Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak said attacking Moscow made no sense for Ukraine but would help Russia justify its own attacks on civilian targets. On Wednesday Russian strikes on Ukraine's southern Kherson region killed 21 people. Mr Zelensky said the shelling had hit \"a railway station and a crossing, a house, a hardware store, a grocery supermarket and a gas station\". The victims included supermarket customers and employees of an energy company who were performing repairs, officials said. Mr Podolyak added that any drones flying over locations in Russia were down to \"guerrilla activities of local resistance forces\". \"Something is happening in RF [Russian Federation], but definitely without Ukraine's drones over the Kremlin,\" Mr Podolyak said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he could not validate Russia's accusation that Ukraine had tried to kill Mr Putin, but said he would take anything the Russian presidency said with a \"very large shaker of salt\". Mick Mulroy, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence and CIA officer, told the BBC that if reports of the incident were accurate, it was \"unlikely\" to be an assassination attempt as Ukraine tracks President Putin's movements closely and he was not in Moscow at the time. \"This may have been to show the Russian people that they can be hit anywhere and that the war they started in Ukraine may eventually come home to Russia, even the capital,\" he said. Alternatively, if the reports were not accurate, \"Russia may be fabricating this to use as a pretext to target President Zelensky - something they have tried to in the past\", Mr Mulroy said. Russia also noted the alleged drone incident had come shortly before Russia's 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow, which foreign dignitaries were expected to attend. The parade will go ahead as planned, Russian officials said. Moscow's mayor on Wednesday announced a ban on unauthorised drone flights over the city. Several Russian cities had already announced they would scale back this year's Victory Day celebrations. Russian authorities have cited security reasons and attacks from pro-Ukrainian forces for the changes. Explosions and fires have occurred in Russia in recent weeks.",

        "title": "Missing Australian fisherman's body found in crocodile",
        "content": "The remains of an Australian man who vanished while fishing with friends have been found inside a crocodile. Kevin Darmody, 65, was last seen at Kennedy's Bend - a well-known saltwater crocodile habitat in a remote part of northern Queensland - on Saturday. After a two-day search of the area, police euthanised two large crocodiles and found human body parts. Police said it was a \"tragic ending\" for Mr Darmody. A formal identification process will be carried out. Mr Darmody was an experienced fisherman and a well-known member of the community in Cape York. The two crocodiles, which measured 4.1m (13.4 ft) and 2.8m (9.2 ft) in length, were shot dead on Monday about 1.5 km (0.9 miles) from where he was last seen. Human remains were found inside only one of the reptiles, but wildlife officers believe both were involved in the incident. The fishermen with Mr Darmody at the time did not see the attack, but reported hearing him yell, followed by a loud splash. \"I raced down\u2026 but there was no sign of him, just his thongs [flip-flops] on the bank and nothing else,\" his friend John Peiti told the Cape York Weekly. Crocodiles are common in Australia's tropical north, but attacks are rare. Mr Darmody's death is just the 13th fatal attack in Queensland since record-keeping began in 1985. A fisherman was killed by a crocodile in similar circumstances on Queensland's Hinchinbrook Island in 2021, and there were also fatal attacks in the state's far north in 2017 and 2016. Since a ban on hunting in 1974, Queensland's crocodile population has rebounded from a low of some 5,000 animals to around 30,000 today. A 2019 report suggested an average of 1.7 adult crocs living in each kilometre of river surveyed. Under Queensland's management programme, \"problem crocodiles\" are removed from areas where they threaten public safety and, in rare instances, euthanised. Those numbers are dwarfed by Australia's Northern Territory (NT), which is home to the world's largest wild crocodile population of some 100,000 reptiles. Despite publicity campaigns to be \"crocwise\" around rivers, there was an average of 1-2 deaths from crocodile attacks in the Territory each year from 2005, but none have occurred since 2018.

        "content": "An emergency radio service for Sudan is to be launched on BBC News Arabic on Tuesday, by the World Service. The pop-up radio service will be broadcast twice daily for three months, providing news and information for people in the war-torn African nation. It will include eyewitness accounts and news on diplomatic efforts, the BBC said, and help counter disinformation. BBC director general Tim Davie said the move was \"crucial at a time of great uncertainty\". The programme will be broadcast live from London, with input and analysis from teams in Amman in Jordan and the Egyptian capital Cairo. It will be available on shortwave radio in Sudan, as well as online, where listeners will be able to hear information on how to access essential supplies and services, the BBC said. \"The World Service provides an essential lifeline to many around the world where access to accurate news and information is scarce,\" Mr Davie said in a statement. \"The enhanced emergency service for Sudan will be crucial at a time of great uncertainty in the country.\" Fighting that has erupted in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country is a direct result of a vicious power struggle within the country's military leadership. The clashes are between the regular army and a paramilitary force called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Liliane Landor, director of the World Service, said: \"The situation in Sudan has escalated quickly with its citizens seeking clear, independent information and advice at a time of critical need. \"BBC Arabic's Emergency Radio Service for Sudan will bring vital live updates of the situation on the ground and inform listeners of life-saving resources.\" The programme will broadcast at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on 21,510 kHz and 17:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on 15,310kHz. The first programme will be available on Tuesday afternoon. Have you been affected by the conflict in Sudan? Please email us: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

        "title": "Terrified Sudanese on the run from Arab militias in Darfur - again",
        "content": "Fleeing for their lives from Arab militias on the rampage is nothing new for the Sudanese people escaping over the border into Chad - their exhausted faces encapsulate the devastation and suffering they have been experiencing over decades. \"We barely managed to return home and start a new life when this fighting forced us to run again,\" Mahmoud Adam Hamad tells the BBC. The showdown that erupted on 15 April between Sudan's two leading generals has triggered another bout of ethnic conflict in Sudan's western Darfur region. The UN estimates that more than 100,000 people have fled the current countrywide clashes, with the largest number fleeing to Chad, just across the border from Darfur. Darfur has been in turmoil for years with violence between its various African and Arab communities. When non-Arabs took up arms against the government in 2003, complaining about discrimination, the government retaliated by mobilising and arming mostly Arab militias. Known as the Janjaweed, they were accused of widespread atrocities. Many of those Janjaweed fighters morphed into the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group that is now battling the army. Arab militias linked to the RSF appear to be taking advantage of the security vacuum in Darfur, unleashing violence that has led to an exodus of people from the region. Some, like Mr Hamad and his family, have ended up in a temporary refugee camp in the Chadian village of Koufroune. An estimated 8,000 people are at the camp, having managed to flee with a few of their belongings and livestock, a valuable asset that could help ease the hardship. Mr Hamad made two dangerous trips last week across the border to bring his two wives and eight children from Darfur. \"I made my journey mainly at night. I brought them in, moving from one location to another with my family until we arrived. \"I was nearly robbed on the second trip,\" he says as he stands next to his temporary shelter made up of sticks and plastic sheeting. His village was previously attacked in Darfur. He lost his farm and animals and some of his relatives were killed by the Janjaweed. \"We were beaten and lashed. We begged them for our release.\" Mr Hamad speaks about how, at the time, he fled from village to village and crossed into Chad. He later returned to Darfur with his family thinking it was safe, but he now finds himself back again. He is now earning a little money in the camp by using his cart to transport the belongings of other refugees. He uses the cash to buy extra food. Ibrahim Bashar Ebra, 83 and his wife, Maka Naseem Tabeer, 70, sit in the shade of a plastic sheet flapping in the wind offering them some respite from the extreme heat. They are surrounded by their belongings covered in blankets to protect them from the dust. They lost their livelihoods in the Darfur conflict after their farm was raided in 2003 and their livestock were stolen. In a later attack three of their children were kidnapped and they have no idea where they are. \"I became destitute without a home and totally dependent on others,\" Mr Ebra says. What forced him to move a fortnight ago was a militia attack on his village that killed many people. \"The whole village was burned to the ground. I was evacuated by a cart and brought here,\" he adds, pointing out that arthritis makes it impossible for him to move on his own. His wife turns to him and asks: \"What do you think about our future from now on?\" \"There's no government in Darfur, only the militias, who are killing, raping and kidnapping. Only God knows what there is in store for us,\" Mr Ebra responds. He says he will \"never\" go back. \"I am safe here; I am happy fetching water from this valley to drink. What would I earn from going back? I am a frail 83 years old, but mentally tough.\" For now, they are being looked after by UN agencies, including the World Food Programme (WFP). Tens of thousands of more refugees are expected and there are fears that the fighting in Darfur could snowball into a full-blown conflict. Chad already hosts more than a million displaced people, including nearly 400,000 Sudanese refugees from Darfur. The race is now on to get support to the camps before the rainy season begins, WFP country director Pierre Honnorat says. \"This is very much needed because in a few weeks, the road to come and assist them will be very very difficult. That's really the issue, we have to have the resources to be able to support them,\" he tells the BBC. The refugees in Koufroune may have reached safety, but like so many Sudanese their future lies in the hands of two generals fighting over their country. They are under intense diplomatic pressure to negotiate an end to the conflict, or risk plunging Sudan into a civil war that could be worse than those in Libya and Syria.",

        "title": "Belgrade shooting: Teen made 'kill list' for Serbia school attack",
        "content": "A teenager who killed eight fellow students and a security guard in a school in Serbia planned the attack for weeks and had a \"kill list\", according to police. The 13-year-old was arrested following Wednesday's attack at the Vladislav Ribnikar primary school in Belgrade. The boy's father and mother have also been arrested. Of those killed, seven of the victims were girls at the school, but the motive for the attack is still unclear. Another six pupils and a teacher were injured in the shooting, four more boys and two girls. A boy who was shot in the neck and chest is said to have suffered the worst injuries, while a girl is in critical condition with a head injury. Officers in helmets and bulletproof vests cordoned off the area around the school, located in the central Vracar neighbourhood, shortly after 08:40 (06:40 GMT). The suspect is alleged to have used his father's guns, both of which had legal permits. He is also said to have gone to a shooting range more than once with his father before the killings. In a televised address to the country, President Aleksandar Vucic described the attack as \"the most difficult day in the modern history of our country\". He said the suspect would be sent to a psychiatric clinic. Under current Serbian law, he cannot be held criminally responsible as he is under 14. Mr Vucic has suggested that the age of criminal liability may be lowered to 12 in the wake of the killings. He has also proposed several other reforms, including an audit on firearms licences and a tightening of the rules around who can access shooting ranges. Police say the suspect planned the attack a month in advance and that he had carried a \"priority list\" of children to target and which classrooms he would go into first. Four of those wounded, three boys and another girl, were stable and conscious on Wednesday. A teacher injured in the attack was also reported to have undergone surgery and the health minister said on Tuesday her life was at risk. Most of the victims were born in 2009 - meaning they were either 13 or 14 at the time of the incident. A national three-day mourning period starting on Friday has been announced. The sounds of crying parents could be heard on the streets around the school hours after the shooting. Milan Milosevic, the father of one of the pupils at the school, said his daughter was in the class where the gun was fired and managed to escape. \"[The boy] first shot the teacher and then he started shooting randomly,\" Mr Milosevic told broadcaster N1. \"I saw the security guard lying under the table. I saw two girls with blood on their shirts. They say he [the shooter] was quiet and a good pupil. He recently joined their class.\" \"I saw kids running out from the school, screaming. Parents came, they were in panic. Later I heard three shots,\" one student told the Serbian state broadcaster RTS. Mr Vucic said the suspect had become friendly with the guard, who was described by one parent as \"a man who loved kids\". Mass shootings are comparatively rare in Serbia, which has very strict gun laws, but gun ownership in the country is among the highest in Europe. The western Balkans are awash with illegal weapons following wars and unrest in the 1990s. In 2019, it was estimated that there are 39.1 firearms per 100 people in Serbia - the third highest in the world, behind the US and Montenegro. In the deadliest shooting since then, Ljubisa Bogdanovic killed 14 people in the central village of Velika Ivanca in 2013, and Nikola Radosavljevic killed nine and wounded five in the eastern village of Jabukovac in July 2007.",

        "title": "What do we know about drone attacks in Russia?",
        "content": "Russia says Ukraine has launched a series of drone attacks on its territory in recent weeks. It accused Ukraine of trying to kill President Vladimir Putin in an alleged drone attack on his residence in the Kremlin on 3 May. Ukraine denied carrying it out. There have been a number of reported drone attacks in Russia and in Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine in recent months - none have been officially claimed by Ukraine. A suspected drone attack injured over 10 Russian soldiers at a military training ground in the Voronezh Region on 10 May, according to local media reports. There have been reports of drones being shot down on the same day in the Kursk and Belgorod regions of Russia, which both border Ukraine. An oil refinery in the Krasnodar region of Russia, about 200km (124 miles) from the Crimean border was targeted by drones on 5 and 4 May, according to Russian media reports. Last month, a drone came down in the town of Kireyevsk, about 400km (249 miles) from the Ukraine border, injuring at least three people in an explosion after it was brought down, Russian state media said. In February, a drone crashed about 100 km (62 miles) from Moscow, in what the local governor said was an attempt to target civilian infrastructure. A picture of the wreckage appeared to be consistent with a UJ-22 - a type of drone manufactured by Ukraine. It has a range of 800km (497 miles) in autonomous flight. Its range under directly-controlled flight is much shorter. In December last year, a drone attack hit an airbase 600km (372 miles) north-east of the Ukrainian border, leaving three people dead, according to the Russian military. Since the start of 2023, the BBC - by analysing Russian media reports - has tracked more than 30 suspected drone attacks inside Russia and Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. These have mostly been in the Bryansk and Belgorod regions in Russia near the north-eastern border, as well as in Crimea. Oil facilities, airfields and energy infrastructure have all been targeted. We counted five drone strikes on oil depots. One of these was in Sevastopol, the capital of Russian-controlled Crimea, which was struck on 29 April, destroying several of its oil tanks. Layla Guest, an analyst at Sibylline security consultancy, says: \"Ukrainian forces will highly likely prioritise targeting oil refineries, as well as railway infrastructure and wider Russian logistics, to cause maximum disruption as part of their strategy ahead of the impending counter-offensive.\" Drones have been deployed by both sides in the conflict, with Russia using Iranian-made drones on targets in Ukraine. Ukraine says it is rapidly increasing its production of drones as demand grows on the front line. In terms of range, experts say drones launched from Ukraine could reach deep into Russian territory, and as far as Moscow, which is about 450km (280 miles) from the border. \"Although Ukraine has not confirmed that its armed forces carried out the attacks, I think that the pre-emptive raids we have seen last year prove that Ukraine has the capability to launch long range attacks of that kind from within Ukrainian territory,\" says David Cenciotti, editor of the Aviationist blog. Drone specialist Steve Wright also said it was possible that a drone could hit the Kremlin having been launched from within Ukraine. But he added: \"My guess is that the drone was launched from far closer in than that, as this would avoid it having to run the gauntlet of much of Moscow's defences.\" Ukraine's Minister for Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov recently boasted of a Ukrainian drone called the R18 that \"can fly from Kyiv to Moscow and back\". But he denied that he was calling for drone strikes on Moscow. Mr Cenciotti says: \"Ukraine has made extensive use of several drones, with the Bayraktar TB2 drone emerging as the real star of the air war for Ukraine, inflicting heavy losses on Russian forces, some of those caught on tape and circulated online.\" Turkey has sold Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine in recent months, while the Turkish manufacturer of the drones has donated some to crowd-funding operations in support of Ukraine.

        "title": "Syria on way back to Arab fold as isolation crumbles",
        "content": "They look like unlikely allies, but on Wednesday the besuited, secular Syrian President Bashar al-Assad warmly welcomed the bearded, turban-wearing Islamist cleric-cum-President of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, to Damascus. It was the first such visit by an Iranian leader since 2010, before the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then, Tehran has proved the staunchest of allies, helping - along with Moscow - to save the Assad regime during a particularly bloody civil war. The trip comes amid dramatic shifts in the region. These have also seen the Syrian president and his entourage - long shunned as pariahs in the Arab world - recently being embraced, quite literally on occasion, by their neighbours. Despite opposition from the US and Europe, it is becoming the norm for Arab states to take steps to normalise ties with Syria. Syria still hopes to be granted observer status at the Arab League summit in Riyadh on 19 May, ahead of its eventual reinstatement. \"The international community outside of the region - Russia aside - has largely washed its hands of responsibility for Syria,\" comments Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding (Caabu). \"There is a vacuum and this is where the regional powers have come in. [They see that] if nothing is going to change, if there is not going to be a real political process, then we as a region cannot afford to ignore Syria. It's too big and significant a country.\" The turnaround is remarkable. Back in late 2011, many Arab states were clearly planning for a post-Assad era when Syria was censured and suspended by the 22-member Arab League. I watched hundreds of Syrians waving flags and chanting their support of that move, close to the League's headquarters in Cairo's Tahrir Square. At that time there had been a brutal crackdown on Syrian pro-democracy protesters and I had reported on waves of refugees fleeing the fighting. But many of the regime's worst atrocities - the indiscriminate barrel bombing and poison gas attacks - were still to come. Now, over a decade on, the figures are jaw-dropping: about half of the Syrian population has been displaced or made refugees, and the UN conservatively estimates that more than 300,000 civilians have been killed and more than 100,000 detained or disappeared. It was Russia's military involvement in Syria in 2015 that changed the course of the bloody civil war and forced its neighbours to begin thinking of a future that left Mr Assad in place \"That was a game-changer for Jordan,\" says Osama al-Sharif, a prominent journalist in Amman, stressing how his country was facing a national security threat and turned to Moscow to apply pressure. \"At the time the war against Daesh [the Islamic State militant group] was also going on... We had [the Lebanese militant group] Hezbollah and other pro-Iranian groups positioned very close to the border.\" President Assad went on to consolidate control over much of Syria, but Arab moves to restore ties accelerated after this February's massive earthquake in Turkey and Syria - with the rush to bring in aid. Then came the China-brokered re-establishment of relations between regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia and its rival, Iran, which have supported opposing sides in the Syrian civil war. In the past few weeks, a beaming Mr Assad has been greeted in Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In Abu Dhabi, his wife, Asma, joined him for her first known official trip abroad in a decade, and was hugged on the tarmac by the wife of the UAE president. Meanwhile, Syria's foreign minister has been off to Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Jordan. The Saudis stressed that they were discussing \"the return of Syria to its Arab fold\". However, there are deep divisions between the Arab states on how and when to rehabilitate Syria. Qatar, Kuwait, Egypt and Jordan have apparently pushed back against plans by Saudi Arabia and the UAE for its rapid reinstallation at the Arab League. \"There seems to be a rush to restore relations with Syria but when asked, no-one could say what guarantees were being sought in return for normalisation,\" says an official from the region with knowledge of recent talks, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"It's a pity. It sends the wrong message. It says there are no consequences,\" the official continues, adding that the Syrians are acting \"in a very arrogant way, like everyone else is lucky to have them\". The US is clear that it does not support restoring ties nor lifting tough economic sanctions on an unapologetic, unreformed Damascus. In March, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf said: \"This regime deserves to be treated as the rogue that it is.\" However, she also urged Arab allies opting to end Mr Assad's isolation to \"make sure that you get something\". She suggested trying to end the trade in Captagon, an illegal drug which is produced in Syria and smuggled out. As I have seen at a hospital treating young addicts from Jordan and the Arab Gulf, this amphetamine - known as \"poor man's cocaine\" - is fast turning Syria into a narco-state and sowing seeds of misery across the Arab world. Other demands could be a reduction in Iran's military presence in Syria and setting conditions that would allow more refugees to return home or safeguard people living in parts of Syria still under opposition control. After years with little progress in talks with the fragmented Syrian opposition, many Arab states would also like to see at least a token effort by Damascus to re-engage. The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, is pushing for this. \"This renewed attention to Syria is very important if it can act as a circuit breaker and unlock long-stalled efforts to move the political process forward,\" he told the UN Security Council on 27 April. Many Syrians will feel let down by the new Arab overtures. Millions living in the remaining opposition-held pockets once viewed Saudi Arabia and other Arab states as allies in their struggle against Mr Assad's rule. They now find themselves more isolated. Refugees, particularly in Lebanon and Turkey - where acceptance has dwindled in the light of economic crises - are increasingly worried about the risk of forced returns. Turkey - which has been a main backer of Syrian armed opposition groups - has also been talking to Damascus. Almost all parties campaigning for its 14 May elections say they want to send Syrians home. \"We're extremely afraid about the election results. They clearly state that they want to deport us,\" says a Syrian refugee, Muhammad, in his Istanbul coffee shop. Human rights activists express huge disappointment that there is little reference to past atrocities in conversations about Syria's rehabilitation. \"It's shocking,\" says Diana Semaan, Syria researcher for Amnesty International. \"What we're seeing now is a complete disregard to the human rights records of the Syrian government and a message being sent that it doesn't matter what's happened.\" Amnesty urges Arab countries to use their influence with the regime to try to prevent further attacks on civilians and arbitrary detentions and torture. There are calls for co-operation as the UN tries to set up an international body to help families of those missing to find out the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. Meanwhile, in Geneva, a team of lawyers continues busily working to support the prosecutions of those accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. The UN's International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) for Syria has already helped in 267 cases, including 28 so far this year. Its head, Catherine Marchi-Uhel says: \"The fight against impunity is ongoing and will continue to be pursued.\" Some Syrians hope that normalisation in the region could mark the start of a return to normal life. Residents of government-held Syria are grappling with rocketing inflation and crippling power shortages. According to the UN, even before February's devastating earthquake hit Syria, 15.3 million people - 70% of the population - were in need of humanitarian assistance. However, Heiko Wimmen, who oversees International Crisis Group's work on Syria, stresses that, at this stage, Arab Gulf states are unlikely to contribute much to the billions of dollars needed to rebuild Syria's ruined cities. \"American sanctions are only one part of that problem. It's a very forbidding environment economically. You need some trappings of a functioning state and functioning governance, some basic level of accountability,\" he says. In order to survive, over the years the cash-strapped Syrian regime has raided and seized dozens of businesses. It stands accused of diverting tens of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid meant for impoverished Syrians, as well as alleged drug trafficking. It is an irony that the problems caused by the Syrian government ensure that it can no longer be ignored by its neighbours - even if Syria's war and its fallout have largely fallen off world news bulletins.",

        "title": "Row over Met Gala's tribute to Karl Lagerfeld",
        "content": "This year's Met Gala - an annual celebration of all things fashion and celebrity - was billed as a tribute to the late German designer Karl Lagerfeld. A-listers invited to the glamourous fundraiser in New York were asked to pay homage to the man who, as creative director for Chanel and Fendi, was one of the industry's most prominent and prolific figures. But he was also controversial, and his views on the #MeToo movement and Germany's decision to open the door to Syrian refugees widely condemned. Among those to have criticised Monday's event on social media is BBC Radio 1 DJ-turned-Hollywood actress Jameela Jamil. Others have suggested some attendees deliberately chose to wear outfits that would have challenged Lagerfeld's views. And notable absences from the red carpet included singer Lana Del Rey, whom he once called \"a little too fat\". Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who co-chaired the event, told BBC News it was a night to celebrate Lagerfeld's body of work - not the man. But Jamil accused organisers of awarding \"the highest honour possible to a known bigot\". In a post on Instagram, the British actress said: \"Last night, Hollywood and fashion said the quiet part out loud, when a lot of famous feminists chose to celebrate at the highest level a man who was so publicly cruel to women, to fat people, to immigrants and to sexual-assault survivors. And all the women's publications, and spectators online, chose to gleefully ignore it.\" The Good Place star accused the industry of \"slippery tactics and double standards\", separating the art from the artist when it was \"convenient\". \"This isn't about cancel culture. Its not even about Karl,\" she said. \"It's about showing how selective cancel culture is within liberal politics, in the most blatant way so far. \"And it's not just Hollywood here - the general public online participated and were entirely complicit in the erasure of the truth last night.\" Meanwhile, Piers Morgan used a column in the New York Post to accuse the celebrities who attended the Met Gala of hypocrisy. They turned \"a blind eye to his monstrously offensive side just because they want to wear his fabulous clothes and show off at one of the biggest media events of the year\", he wrote. Few other celebrities have spoken out against the decision to honour Lagerfeld - but there has been social media speculation that some used other means to protest. A picture of famously proudly plus-sized pop star Lizzo eating chips while wearing her red-carpet outfit was posted on her social-media accounts. Her black dress with pearls echoed a famous Lagerfeld piece worn by Linda Evangelista in 1991. But was her pre-show snack simply preparation for the night ahead, after complaining last year about the lack of food and a long queue for the red carpet? Or was it a retort to Lagerfeld's opinions on fuller figures? \"No-one wants to see curvy women,\" he once said. And asked about women who object to thin models, he replied: \"They are fat mummies sitting with their bags of crisps in front of the television, saying that thin models are ugly.\" Many guests wore black and white - reflecting Lagerfeld's signature look - but some, including actress Viola Davis and model Ashley Graham, wore pink. But had they decided to deliberately ignore one of his most quoted mantras, \"Think pink, don't wear it\"? Or did they just like the colour? After all - despite his outspoken opinions - pink did appear in some of his collections. Graham wrote on Instagram: \"Honoured to wear this show-stopping creation... paying tribute to the iconic Karl Lagerfeld - I just feel so beautiful\", while Davis called it a \"true princess moment\". Singer Courtney Love, a friend of Lagerfeld, complained on Twitter that in general the Met Gala showed \"total disrespect for your legacy\". That, and it was \"BORING\".",

        "title": "Dancing on the grave: The decades-old murder that shook India",
        "content": "Shakereh Khaleeli was \"rich and beautiful\" and came from one of the most aristocratic families in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. But in 1991, the wealthy heiress went missing and it seemed like she had vanished into thin air. For three years, her second husband - Murali Manohar Mishra, better known as Swami Shraddhananda - made up fantastic stories about her whereabouts. In 1994, her remains were dug out from under the courtyard of their swanky home in the city of Bengaluru (then Bangalore). Shakereh had been drugged, packed in a wooden casket and - it was later revealed - buried alive. In 2003, the trial court convicted Shraddhananda for murder and gave him the death penalty, which the high court later confirmed. The courts accepted that he had pursued and married Shakereh for her wealth and properties worth billions of rupees. During his appeal, the Supreme Court called it a case of \"a man's vile greed coupled with devil's cunning\", but commuted his sentence to life in prison \"without remission\". Last week, the top court refused to entertain his plea for parole. The sensational crime that shook India 30 years ago is the subject of a new web show being streamed on Amazon Prime Video called Dancing on the Grave - named so because of the dance parties Shraddhananda reportedly held in the courtyard where his wife lay buried. Its producer Chandni Ahlawat Dabas of India Today Originals Production says there were \"whats, whys and hows\" around this crime that still seemed unbelievable. \"Despite being 30 years old, we felt that this was a crime that needed to be shared because it's such a mystery even today,\" she adds. The series on the murder - and the murderer - fails to answer all the questions, but it's a riveting watch and has generated a lot of attention in India. The first two episodes of the four-part series delve into Shakereh's life. The granddaughter of Sir Mirza Ismail - who served as the Dewan of the princely states of Mysore, Bangalore, Jaipur and Hyderabad and is credited with building several landmark buildings and monuments - she was married to the dashing diplomat Akbar Khaleeli and was mother to four girls. Family members describe her as \"a charming, larger-than-life character\" who was \"fond of vintage cars, very social, very loving and loveable\". But in mid-1980s, she met Shraddhananda and her life took a sharp turn. BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi, who at the time worked for the Times of India newspaper in Bangalore and features in the docuseries, says \"the murder shocked people primarily because of the manner in which she was killed - the fact that she was buried alive\". The crime also \"became the talk of the town because Shakereh had married a man like Shraddhananda after divorcing her first husband\", he adds. In press clippings from the time, Shraddhananda was described as a school dropout from a poor family, a \"fake holy man\" and an \"errand boy\" who endeared himself to Shakereh by \"helping resolve some property matters\" for her and \"exploiting her desire to have a son by claiming magical powers\". Reports say their relationship began to unravel soon after their marriage in 1986 and that the two quarrelled frequently, mostly over money matters, leading to Shraddhananda plotting to execute his wife in such a grisly manner. But despite the fact that he was found guilty by a total of eight judges from India's trial court, the high court and the Supreme Court, his lawyer insists that the evidence against him at best is circumstantial - and in the web series, we hear from Shraddhananda himself who still denies his crime. Some have questioned the show for giving a platform to a convicted murderer, but Patrick Graham, Mumbai-based British filmmaker who co-wrote and directed Dancing on the Grave, defends the decision to give Shraddhananda's story so much play. \"I think it's very important that we hear his side of the story, more so because we never heard from him in the past 30 years. Moreover, he gave us invaluable insights into Shakereh's character,\" he told the BBC. Graham says the team went into the jail because they wanted to find out how someone like Shakereh could be swayed by a man like Shraddhananda. \"But we were also swayed by him initially into believing that there were layers to the story, though none of us had any doubts about his crime by the time we finished with him.\" He says they went in, \"wary of coming across as bullies to this very small, frail, old man. But as we found out more about the story, and as we interacted more with him, we felt like he had an agenda, he was playing us, that he was spinning a yarn\". \"The more time we spent with him, the more it became clear to us that his feelings were not genuine, and towards the end we tried to have a more robust conversation with him,\" says Graham. And that, he says, resulted in \"a rant\" from Shraddhananda, with him \"insisting that he was innocent, that he was being treated badly\". In most true crime series, Graham says, a criminal is made out to be \"a genius\". \"But I was very clear that I didn't want to do that. Of course Shraddhananda had a few gifts, one of them was to make people believe him,\" he says. But in the end, he could not make the Indian courts believe in his innocence.

        "content": "Beyond the Eurovision Song Contest's carnival of outlandish costumes, variable Europop and volatile voting, there is something bigger at stake for this year's host city. In a souvenir shop in Liverpool, some new additions are on display alongside the usual Beatles and football merchandise. There's a blue-and-yellow woolly hat with \"Liverpool\" on one side, \"Ukraine\" on the other, and the date 2023 (yours for \u00a319.99). There are heart-shaped fridge magnets with the city's Liver Bird mascot against a similar blue-and-yellow background, next to magnets with the faces of the Fab Four. There's a flag saying \"Liverpool song contest\" and the dates 9-13 May 2023. The word Eurovision doesn't appear - presumably for trademark reasons, as these are unofficial mementos. But the products are ready for the visitors who are expected to flood here for the annual continental music competition. It was awarded to the city after organisers decided it was too dangerous to be staged by 2022's winners Ukraine, following Russia's invasion. And while Liverpool is promising to put the country front and centre in its activities, and merchandise, it is also taking its own chance to harness the power of Eurovision. There are hopes that around 100,000 visitors and the exposure to 160 million TV viewers will boost the local economy. It's been transformed by tourism over the past two decades but also hit by the Covid pandemic. Eurovision could be worth \u00a325m to Liverpool this year and a further \u00a3250m from an upturn in visitor numbers over the next three years, according to council estimates. Meanwhile, NatWest has estimated that visitors will spend \u00a340m in the city across Eurovision week alone. \"It is a tremendous shot in the arm for the economy,\" says Dr Michael Jones, a senior lecturer in music industries at the University of Liverpool. \"The city council is determined to maximise it, to put the flags out and say, 'We're back as a city, come to Liverpool.' \"And I don't think that's at all cynical. It's an expression of self-confidence, and the city has struggled. This is an opportunity. It's maximising it, I think, in a thoughtful and sensitive way.\" Last year's contest attracted 55,000 tourists to Turin, despite some Covid measures still being in place. The Italian city said those visitors generated 23m euros (\u00a320m), with the media exposure worth an extra 66m euros (\u00a358m). Liverpool is hoping Eurovision's global spotlight will allow it to build on a 15-year period in which it has reinvented its image from declining post-industrial city to popular destination. In the decade before Covid, Liverpool saw an 87% rise in international tourists (compared with 37% overall for the UK). Music has played a big part in the city's fortunes, and Beatles tourism was estimated to be worth \u00a3100m to the city in 2019. Although Beatles tourism is not new, it has boomed in recent years, according to Jon Keats, a director of the company that runs the famous Cavern Club as well as an annual Beatles convention, which began in the late 1970s. \"When we started doing the Beatles convention, there were three hotels in the city, I think,\" he says. Now, Liverpool's global appeal is reflected in the audience when Keats performs as a singer in the Cavern himself. \"The other day I had [fans from] Honolulu on one side and Ecuador on the other side, wedged between Australia and Cleethorpes.\" Back in 2009, there weren't enough customers to open the Cavern all week. \"Then it just kept on getting busier and busier, to the point where we now have live music from 11:00 every day and it doesn't stop,\" he says. \"So there's been a massive change.\" This new Beatlemania is centred on Mathew Street, where the Cavern (resurrected in 1984 a few doors down from the original) has been joined by more themed bars, pubs and a museum. \"It's a busy street,\" Mr Keats says. \"There are many Beatle-themed [things], rightly or wrongly. This is another challenge for Liverpool - we need to make sure we don't turn Liverpool into a Disney version of the Beatles.\" While The Beatles are the main attraction, Liverpool is trying to draw attention to other strands of its musical identity. In the late 1970s and 80s, venues like Eric's - opposite the Cavern - produced bands like Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Echo and the Bunnymen, Julian Cope's The Teardrop Explodes and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. \"Eric's for me is way more important than the Cavern because of what came after it,\" says Frankie Goes To Hollywood guitarist Brian Nash. Nash has recently formed a supergroup of sorts with Peter Hooton and Keith Mullin of 1990s band The Farm. Instead of making music, they are leading guided tours of the city's post-punk and alternative music scene, as well as some Beatles-related heritage. \"There's so much more to Liverpool than that,\" Nash says. \"What we want to talk about is our time, and the changes that have happened in the city since then.\" Music was a bright spot in the 80s. At the time, riots, unemployment and poverty led Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe to urge Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to consider abandoning the city to a fate of \"managed decline\". Nash says residents of the 80s would \"never have predicted\" how far the city would come since then. \"If you were standing here in 1984, you'd have gone, 'No chance'. We were written off.\" \"OK, this is a nostalgia tour,\" adds Hooton. \"But it's also a tour of hope - to say, look, this can happen from nothing.\" Eurovision and Liverpool's wider musical pedigree will now be used to brand it as a music city, not just as Beatles city. Another key moment in Liverpool's regeneration came when it was European Capital of Culture in 2008. \"I don't think anyone would have believed you, pre-Capital of Culture, if you said Liverpool's economy would be run by visitors,\" says Claire McColgan, the council's director of culture. Today, almost half of the council's business rates come from the visitor economy sector, she says. The song contest does have a cost for Liverpool. The council is spending \u00a32m on the event, with another \u00a32m coming from the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Some will question whether that's the best use of public money during a cost of living crisis. McColgan says most in the city now understand that culture can bring big returns. Eurovision is \"an investment into the city's future\", she continues. \"It's investment into jobs, into people wanting to invest here, people wanting to come to college here. It's part of a much bigger picture, and we see it like that here. \"And it's a small investment compared to the return that we're going to get from it. And not just Liverpool - the wider region and also the UK.\" Eurovision has already brought \u00a315m in to the city, McColgan says, while bars and hotels - and souvenir shops - will feel the benefit when the visitors arrive.

        "title": "Ukraine war: How old tech is helping Ukraine avoid detection",
        "content": "As Ukraine prepares for its major offensive, it will only get harder to hide the troop build up from Russia's forces. So Ukraine is having to work out ways to confound the enemy. In a trench on the eastern front, a Ukrainian mortar team knows Russia's not just trying to hunt them down with drones - it's also using electronic warfare to try to locate their position. The men of Ukraine's 28th Brigade may have access to 21st Century technology - satellites, smart phones, and tablets - to help communicate and identify targets. But they're also using a machine from the distant past. An antique that wouldn't look out of place in a trench during World War One: an old wind-up phone. Vlad and his men pick up the field phone whenever they're about to fire a mortar. Its dull ring makes a sound from a bygone era. For outgoing calls, they must wind up a handle. It's like a scene from a black and white movie. Vlad grabs the cables that reach out to other nearby trenches. He says it's the safest means of communication, and that \"it's impossible to listen in\". He says Russian electronic warfare systems can detect and intercept mobile phones and radios, but pointing to his ancient field telephone, Vlad says: \"This technology is very old - but it works really well.\" So far, Russia's conventional forces have performed poorly and suffered heavy losses, but it still has some of the world's most advanced electronic warfare systems - the invisible means to track an enemy and to intercept or block communications. In fixed defensive positions they'll make Ukrainian advances more dangerous and difficult. Russia's Zoopark radars can locate artillery fire. Its Zhitel vehicles detect, track and block radio frequencies, while the Borisoglebsk-2 can disrupt satellite communications like GPS. Russia's use of electronic warfare is also making it harder for Ukraine's army of drones - key to getting a bird's eye view of the battlefield. At another location on the eastern front, Oleksii and his drone intelligence unit of the 59th Brigade use the cover of a bombed out building to fly their small Chinese commercial drone to identify Russian positions. In the early stages of the war, Ukraine appeared to be more adept in their use. But Oleksii says now \"the sky is full of drones\". He says the Russians, too, are using the same models, but have more of them. Though he believes they \"care less about them\". Oleksii says he's already lost five small Chinese-made drones and his Brigade \"might lose three to four drones a day\". He says the enemy have access to radio-electronic warfare stations and anti-drone guns which \"can transmit interference and interrupt communications\" to disable their drones. But in skilful hands, he adds, a small commercial drone like a Mavic can last \"between two and three weeks\". They try their best to avoid detection - using encryption and altering their drone's geolocation. The one he's flying over Russian trenches is using a VPN in Australia, meaning it appears to be flying around the southern continent. But he says the disguise doesn't always work. In contrast, Ukraine's efforts to bring down Russian drones can be more rudimentary - as we witnessed at another position. Ukrainian troops point to a drone flying high in the distance. It's an Orlan - a larger, Russian-made drone that can carry out surveillance or intercept communications. This time it's scouting out nearby Ukrainian defensive positions to direct artillery fire. We hear the whizz of the shells before seeing the impact and smoke rising in the distance. The response of the nearby Ukrainian troops is to open up with a hail of bullets toward the sky, fired from their automatic rifles. But the Russian drone is too high. In this instance, their gunfire is futile. In a nearby command centre, Bohdan, of Ukraine's 10th Brigade, expresses his frustration that they can't do more. He says Russian drones are flying \"every day, every hour, every second. They have the resources for that. We fight against it but not as much as we'd like.\" The large screen behind him though shows that Ukraine is still able to do the same - even if they must now consider their drones as expendable items of war. We watch a live video feed from a Ukrainian drone hovering over nearby trenches. Russia may have the advantage in electronic warfare and more drones - they'll provide a challenge for Ukraine's coming offensive. But Russia has not yet been able to gain control of the skies, or defeat Ukrainian resistance and ingenuity.",

        "title": "New York subway passenger died after chokehold",
        "content": "The New York City medical examiner has ruled a subway passenger was killed by a chokehold after a fight with another passenger that was caught on camera. Officials say Jordan Neely's death was caused by homicide, from \"compression of neck [chokehold]\". Video of the incident shows Mr Neely, 30, struggling as another man grabs him and holds him on the ground. Police have questioned and released the 24-year-old US Marine who restrained the passenger. Homicide means a death caused by another person, but is not necessarily a murder. It is now up to police and prosecutors to determine if charges are warranted. \"As part of our rigorous ongoing investigation, we will review the Medical Examiner's report, assess all available video and photo footage, identify and interview as many witnesses as possible, and obtain additional medical records,\" a spokesman for Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement following the ruling. \"This investigation is being handled by senior, experienced prosecutors and we will provide an update when there is additional public information to share,\" he added. The incident happened on Monday afternoon on the F-line train in the SoHo section of Manhattan. On Wednesday, a rally for Mr Neely was held on the train platform near to where he died. \"Justice for Jordan Neely,\" the crowd chanted, according to CBS. \"If we don't get it, shut it down.\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams urged the public to be patient and allow the investigation to determine all of the facts. \"There are so many unknowns at this time,\" he told CNN. \"We cannot just blanketly say what a passenger should or shouldn't do in a situation like that,\" he added. A video captured by a freelance journalist on the train shows the former Marine holding the 30-year-old man - who was said to have been acting erratically - around the neck for two minutes and 55 seconds. Two other riders are also seen restraining his arms. All three later let go of the man, who is then seen lying motionless on the floor. Police sources told BBC's US news partner CBS that the man who died was throwing rubbish and yelling at passengers. Mr Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator and was living on the streets, according to US media. Officers arrived at the scene at about 14:27 local time (19:27 BST) and found the man unresponsive. He was later taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Juan Alberto Vazquez, the freelance journalist who filmed the incident, told the New York Times that the deceased man was screaming on the train before he was restrained. \"'I don't have food, I don't have a drink, I'm fed up,'\" the man screamed, according to Mr Vazquez. \"'I don't mind going to jail and getting life in prison. I'm ready to die.'\" He added the passenger was frightening, but had not assaulted anyone. At the time of the incident, Mr Vasquez said he did not believe the man would die. \"None of us were thinking that,\" he told the New York Times. \"He was moving and he was defending himself.\" New York Governor Kathy Hochul called the video \"deeply disturbing, and that causes a lot of fear for people\". She said the state would work with the city to determine whether homelessness and access to mental health services \"were a factor here\".",

        "title": "US interest rates raised to highest level in 16 years",
        "content": "The US central bank has raised interest rates to the highest level in 16 years as it battles to stabilise prices. The Federal Reserve increased its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points - its 10th hike in 14 months. That pushed its benchmark rate to between 5% and 5.25%, up from near zero in March 2022, although the Fed hinted the rise may be its last one for now. The European Central Bank has also raised rates again, although by a smaller amount than in previous months. The ECB lifted its three key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, whereas the three preceding meetings have all seen a larger rise. In the US, higher rates have sharply raised borrowing costs, spurring a slowdown in sectors such as housing and playing a role in the recent failures of three US banks. \"We're no longer saying that we anticipate\" additional interest rate increases, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said after the announcement, calling it a \"significant change\". However, he refused to rule out further action, saying: \"We'll be driven by incoming data.\" The bank started raising interest rates aggressively last year when prices in the US were soaring at the fastest pace in decades. Higher interest rates make it more expensive to buy a home, borrow to expand a business or take on other debt. By increasing those costs, officials expect demand to fall and prices to cool off. Since the Fed started its campaign, price increases in the US have shown signs of moderating. In March, inflation, the rate at which prices rise, stood at 5% - the lowest level in nearly two years - though still uncomfortably high for the Fed, which is targeting a 2% rate. Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, said he thought the Fed would be \"prudent\" to pause now, noting that the risks to the economy as activity slows are growing. \"The fear of a recession is very much present in the economy today,\" he said. \"I don't think the inflation battle is over, but we are in a situation where we're seeing gradual disinflation and we're also in an environment where interest rates are high and elevated and therefore should be constraining business activity, which should lead to further disinflation in coming months.\" At Ball Chain Manufacturing, a family-owned firm in New York, customers have become more cautious in recent months due to economic worries, says president Bill Taubner. His company has also cut back on replenishing its supplies in response to still-rising prices. But he said his firm did not face imminent borrowing needs and he remained hopeful that any slowdown would be mild and relatively short-lived. \"We realise there is some softness in the marketplace because of inflation and obviously the interest rate issues,\" he said. \"But long term, we're very positive.\" The recent bank failures, and an anticipated pullback in lending as a result, are likely to weigh on the economy, Mr Powell said. But he added that he remained hopeful that the US would avoid a recession, noting that hiring has remained strong and unemployment low. \"I continue to think that it's possible\u2026 that this time is really different,\" he said. The Fed's decision to raise rates on Wednesday was unanimous and widely expected by financial markets, which are looking for clues as to what the bank may do next. In a written statement, the bank scrapped previous guidance it provided in March when it said \"some additional policy firming may be appropriate\" to bring inflation under control. In the press conference, Mr Powell said the bank was \"getting close or maybe even there\" when it came to pausing its rate-hike campaign but was prepared to do more if warranted. Whitney Watson, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said the Fed could still raise rates, depending on what happens in the coming months. \"Inflation is trending in the right direction, but progress has been bumpy,\" she said. \"A pause in rate actions is therefore appropriate, but further tightening is plausible should inflation prove sticky.\" In Europe, the European Central Bank has also been raising rates to try to slow the pace of price increases in the countries that use the euro. Earlier this week, figures showed that eurozone inflation increased in April for the first time in six months. Prices rose at an annual pace of 7%, well above the ECB's target of 2%. On Thursday, the ECB raised its key deposit rate - how much interest it pays on deposits - to 3.25% from 3%. It also lifted its main refinancing rate - how much banks have to pay when they borrow money from the ECB - to 3.75% from 3.5%. However, unlike the US Fed on Thursday, the ECB did not hint that it might have finished with rate rises for now. ECB president Christine Lagarde said the inflation outlook \"continues to be too high for too long\", and speaking to reporters she said: \"We are not pausing - that is very clear.\" Additional reporting by Michelle Fleury, North America business correspondent.",

        "title": "Francisco Oropesa: Texas shooting suspect captured after tip-off",
        "content": "A man suspected of killing five of his neighbours in Texas has been arrested after police found him hiding in a cupboard underneath a pile of laundry. Francisco Oropesa was detained north of Houston. He was several miles from his own home where the shootings happened late on Friday. Mr Oropesa is accused of attacking his neighbours after they allegedly asked him to stop practising with his rifle as the noise was keeping a baby awake. The victims included a nine-year-old. They were all from Honduras, and the country's foreign ministry identified them as Sonia Guzman, 28; Diana Velasquez, 21; Obdulia Molina, 31; Jonathan Caceres, 18, and Daniel Enrique Lazo, nine. The arrest of Mr Oropesa, a 38-year-old Mexican national, brings an end to a four-day manhunt that swept up law enforcement officials across multiple jurisdictions, including the FBI. Drones and scent-tracking dogs were used as police searched an area as far south as the Mexican border. Authorities offered a reward of $80,000 (\u00a364,000) for information leading to his arrest and, on Tuesday, the FBI said Mr Oropesa \"could be anywhere\" as the days-long search failed to yield any leads. But a member of the public contacted the FBI's tip line on Tuesday evening and the suspect was captured just over an hour later near the town of Cut and Shoot, officials said in a news conference. Police have not said who owns the home he was arrested in, but the New York Times reported that property records show it belongs to a relative. \"They can rest easy now, because he is behind bars,\" Sherriff Greg Capers said of the families of the victims. \"He will live out his life behind bars for killing those five.\" The suspect was taken into custody by members of the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, or Bortac, a specialised unit, said Sheriff Capers of San Jacinto County. He will be charged with five counts of murder. The alleged attacker was deported four times between 2009 and 2016, US immigration officials said, although it is unclear on what grounds this happened. An investigation is under way into how the suspect obtained the weapon used in the killings, which was an AR-style rifle. On Wednesday, police said Mr Oropesa's wife had also been arrested. Divimara Lamar Nava, 53, was detained in connection with the Friday night shooting in the small town of Cleveland. Montgomery County Sheriff Rand Henderson said she allegedly hid Mr Oropesa before he was captured by police. She faces the felony charge of hindering the apprehension or prosecution of a known criminal. Also on Wednesday, officials said Mr Oropesa was spotted in Montgomery County - where he was later arrested - on Monday afternoon but managed to evade capture. \"We did confirm that was him on foot, running but we lost track of him. That was not a false alarm. That was him,\" Sheriff's Deputy Tim Kean said. A makeshift memorial with floral tributes, balloons and soft toys has been placed outside the home where the shooting took place.",

The vessels were reportedly located using intercepted Russian navy communications. Underwater explosions last September knocked the two Nord Stream pipelines - built to carry gas from Russia to Europe - out of action. The cause of the blasts is unclear. Formal investigations are still taking place in countries close to the blast site. So far, they have said only that they believe the explosions were the result of sabotage rather than any kind of accident. But one possible lead pointing towards Russian involvement has emerged from details of suspicious Russian ship movements in the run-up to the Nord Stream blasts, reported by four Nordic public broadcasters and an accompanying English-language podcast Cold Front. And Denmark's Defence Command has confirmed a separate report that a Danish patrol boat called Nymfen took 26 photos of a Russian submarine-rescue ship in the area days before the explosions. The Information website said the SS-750 had sailed from Kaliningrad and was close to Bornholm island on 22 September 2022. The investigation by Denmark's DR, Norway's NRK, Sweden's SVT, and Finland's Yle focuses on the movements and actions of ships between June and September last year which they describe as highly unusual. The ships are believed to include the Russian naval research vessel Sibiryakov, the tugboat SB-123, and a third ship from the Russian naval fleet that the media outlets have not been able to identify by name. These were so-called \"ghost-ships\", which had their transmitters turned off. The broadcasters, however, say they were able to track their movements, using intercepted radio communications the vessels sent to Russian naval bases. The first vessel departed from a Russian naval base in Kaliningrad before arriving near the pipeline on 7 June. One radio message places it directly above Nord Stream 2 before moving further north, close to the Nord Stream 1 pipelines, spending hours in the area where the pipeline runs about 80m (260ft) below the surface and where some of the leaks would later occur. The Sibiryakov arrived on 14 June and went to the same position as the first vessel, close to Nord Stream, and remained there until the next day. The movements were tracked by a former British naval intelligence officer, who worked on interception of the Russian Baltic Fleet until he retired in 2018. The anonymous officer says he used open-source information and radio communications to carry out his research. He says the pattern of radio communications in June indicated they were in an \"operational phase\" at some points. The tugboat, the SB-123, sailed out to the area on the evening of 21 September. The broadcasters say they intercepted communications that suggest it was operating close to the pipelines and the areas of the explosion from late that evening until around 14:00 on 22 September. The tugboat is also mentioned in the Information story about the SS-750 submarine-rescue ship, which followed up a German report in March of suspected Russian involvement in the area. Satellite imagery examined by the broadcasters is said to support the claims about the unusual routes, and other reports in Germany had claimed it was in the area on 21-22 September. The Sibiryakov is believed to be capable of underwater surveillance and mapping as well as launching a small underwater vehicle. It can be used to support and rescue submarines and has the ability to carry out operations on the seabed, according to experts interviewed by the broadcasters. The Nordic broadcasters do not say there is conclusive proof of what the vessels were up to or that Russia was behind the blast. But the documentary raises questions about the unusual nature of the activity. Last month the series revealed that Russian vessels appeared to be mapping out wind farms in the North Sea, including off the UK coast. Russia has consistently denied any involvement in the blasts. In the immediate aftermath, some in the West pointed the finger at Russia, while Moscow blamed Western countries, including the UK. More recently, there were reports that intelligence pointed towards pro-Ukrainian operatives, although not the Ukrainian government itself.",

        "content": "MasterChef Australia will air its new season on Sunday, six days after the sudden death of one of its hosts, award-winning chef Jock Zonfrillo. The 7 May premiere has the \"full support\" of the 46-year-old Scotsman's family, broadcaster Network 10 said. A tribute show will air one hour before the MasterChef Australia season begins. Zonfrillo was found dead in Melbourne on Monday - the new show was to have aired that night. Police are not treating his death as suspicious. He is survived by his wife Lauren Fried and four children. Glasgow-born Zonfrillo took great pride in mentoring contestants in the high-pressure competition and in the process, he inspired a nation of home cooks, Network 10 said on Wednesday. \"It is with Jock in our hearts that we cherish this season and remember the charismatic and big-hearted judge and chef who we knew and loved,\" the network said. The show was swiftly postponed when news of the chef's death broke. \"I know my heart will break but I'm looking forward to watching Jock's final season. I want to see him mentoring the home cooks and giving some advice to them and watching them grow as pro cooks. That is how I want to remember him,\" one Twitter user said in reply to Network 10's announcement. \"This must have been a really emotionally tough decision for Jock's family. I think I'll need a box of tissues for this one,\" another Twitter user replied. Zonfrillo started hosting MasterChef Australia in 2019, after years of establishing himself in the country's kitchens. He had likened moving to Australia in 2000 to turning a new leaf after battling heroin addiction in his teenage years that made him broke and homeless for a time. He opened up about these struggles in his 2021 memoir, Last Shot. He opened several restaurants in Australia, the most successful of which was Adelaide's award-winning Restaurant Orana, which opened in 2013. However, Orana closed in 2020 and Zonfrillo ended the year with millions of dollars in debt.",

        "title": "Why Tritium Could Be Crucial to Biden\u2019s EV Charger Agenda | TIME",
        "content": "I\nn the wake of federal mandates to phase out gasoline-powered cars, fast chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) are quickly becoming some of the most crucial infrastructure for the U.S. transition away from fossil fuels. And one of the most important manufacturers in that space is an Australian company that few people outside the world of clean tech have heard of. Tritium, a publicly-held company based in Brisbane, has about 6,000 fast chargers deployed in the U.S., according to the company\u2019s data. That\u2019s less than Tesla, the 500-pound gorilla in the EV charging world, which has a network of nearly 7,000 fast chargers around the country and a factory in Buffalo, New York, to keep churning out more. But while Tesla recently started opening a few of its chargers to all EV owners (and plans to make thousands more universally-usable by the end of 2024) most Tesla chargers still only work for the company\u2019s own vehicles. That leaves Tritium holding about 30% of the U.S. market for universal EV chargers, the largest share of any company. It also has the largest U.S.-based factory capacity to build those universal chargers, which will be crucial to picking up lucrative contracts as part of a new $5 billion federal push to build out EV fast chargers. (That effort, introduced under the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, stipulates that the federally-funded fast chargers must be assembled in the United States.) Tritium\u2019s chargers are largely marketed under other brand names, a fact that likely accounts for some of the charging giant\u2019s lack of name recognition. When companies like Shell and ChargePoint build fast charging infrastructure, they have often bought the chargers from Tritium. Tritium\u2019s branding is often visible on the upper part of these charging units. \u201cAre you familiar with \u2018Intel Inside\u2019?\u201d says Mike Calise, president of the company\u2019s Americas division. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2018Tritium on Top.\u2019\u201d Some of the most ballyhood new pushes into EV charging in recent months have relied on Tritium equipment. Tritium is supplying equipment for BP\u2019s push into electric vehicle charging, which involves BP building out airport fast charger hubs for car rental giant Hertz\u2019s transition into electric vehicles. Tritium is also the manufacturer behind rideshare company Revel\u2019s ambitions to build out more than 160 fast charger stalls in New York City by the end of 2023. The charger company has also developed close ties to the Biden Administration. Calise says the company was involved in drafting Transportation Department charger standards after the passage of the infrastructure law in November 2021, which included the $5 billion program for fast charging along highways known as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. The Administration also gave Tritium top billing at a February 2022 White House event on electrifying transportation, touting the company\u2019s plan to open a factory in Lebanon, Tennessee, capable of rolling out 30,000 fast chargers a year. \u201cThe manufacturing facility Tritium announced today is more than just great news for Tennessee,\u201d President Joe Biden said at the time, standing next to a Tritium charger. \u201cThis is great news for workers across the country, for an economy, and, frankly, for the planet.\u201d The facility opened in August of that year. There\u2019s good reason for the President to lavish such attention on the Australian manufacturer. U.S.-built green infrastructure is part of the narrative that Biden is selling to the American people, and Tritium was the kind of story they wanted to highlight. Tritium CEO Jane Hunter says the company was deciding whether to build a factory in Europe or in the U.S. before the passage of the 2021 infrastructure law, but ultimately went with the Tennessee location after the bill\u2019s funding passed. \u201cWe probably couldn\u2019t have been more in the sweet spot of what President Biden was hoping to drive with that strategy,\u201d says Hunter. And, to a certain extent, the Administration\u2019s goal of electrifying American transportation hinges on direct current (DC) fast chargers like those Tritium sells. They\u2019re big, complicated electrical installations, not to be confused with more run of the mill level 2 charger someone might install in their garage. Those level 2 chargers may be convenient for homeowners, but they also take a few hours to charge up an EV. That\u2019s useful for charging during the workday or overnight. But there are a lot of situations where slow charging doesn\u2019t cut it, like on long road trips, or for anyone who doesn\u2019t have their own driveway or parking spot that has a personal EV charging port. The U.S. needs plentiful infrastructure that resembles the current network of gas stations, but for electricity\u2014a place where drivers can stop in, power up a car in a matter of minutes, and be on their way. The system also has to be far easier to navigate than the current hodgepodge of EV charging networks, which is plagued by broken chargers and time-wasting systems requiring customers to load money on network-specific apps to pay for charging. The new infrastructure isn\u2019t cheap, though: the costs for installing a DC charger can run from $28,000 to close to $140,000, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. There\u2019s also a chicken and egg problem for companies that might be interested in building it: they need assurance that there will be enough EVs to use their DC fast chargers so they won\u2019t lose money, but a lot of people may be holding back on switching to EVs without the existence of a reliable extensive network of fast chargers. The government is trying to jump-start that adoption cycle, and Tritium, for its part, is well positioned to get in on the game. In February, the Transportation Department released a final rule laying out expectations for the NEVI system, mandating that new chargers can\u2019t be out of order more than 3% of the time on average, and that the chargers accept major credit cards without using an app. They also have to meet a certain minimum charging speed, and be manufactured and assembled in the United States. Tritium says it has a fast charging system that meets those requirements, announcing the product offering in March. Federal funding started making its way to states last fall, and the charging dollars will likely end up in the hands of multiple charger manufacturers. But Calise says Tritium will likely be in pole position\u2014it has enough manufacturing capacity at the Tennessee facility to supply the entire program for all 50 states. \u201cThat\u2019s not daunting to us,\u201d says Calise. \u201cWe need way more fast chargers than NEVI [will build]. We\u2019re planning on that. That\u2019s our market.\u201d Correction, May 16 The original version of this article misstated whether ChargePoint purchases Tritium chargers. Chargepoint has purchased chargers from Tritium in the past, but does not currently.",

        "title": "What Is Orienteering? And Why It's So Good for You | Time",
        "content": "If getting lost in the woods sounds like fun to you, you\u2019d love orienteering. The sport involves navigating through unfamiliar terrain, often in a forest, to locations circled on a detailed topographic map. (These spots are typically marked by a flag, and participants record proof that they were there, sometimes with a small electronic device.) You can only use your map and a compass\u2014no smartphones or GPS\u2014to guide the way. Rather than following one specified route, people need to figure out what path makes the most sense, while maneuvering around obstacles like bodies of water, hills, or boulders. While it\u2019s still under-the-radar in the U.S., thousands of spectators and participants consistently attend events throughout Europe. Orienteers\u2014who range in age from children to seniors\u2014show up to have adventurous fun, meet new friends in a beautiful setting, and enjoy a variety of mental and physical health benefits. Research suggests orienteering contributes to enhanced fitness (by improving aerobic capacity, flexibility, and speed), lower levels of psychological distress, and better brain health. \u201cWe brand it as a sport for life, because it\u2019s adaptable to your skill and physical abilities,\u201d says Emma Waddington, a graduate student in kinesiology at McMaster University in Canada who conducted a recent study about orienteering\u2019s impact on the brain. She\u2019s also an athlete on the Canadian National Orienteering Team, traveling the globe to compete in races. \u201cI saw these older adults out there and I was like, \u2018What are they doing differently that allows them to be engaging in such a cognitively demanding sport at such an old age, when we typically see declines in spatial skills and memory?\u2019\u201d Waddington\u2019s study, published in January in PLOS One, suggests the sport could help fight or prevent age-related cognitive decline in spatial navigation and memory. After surveying 158 people ages 18 to 87, the researchers concluded that orienteering \u201cmay be more beneficial than physical activity alone.\u201d That\u2019s because exercising while navigating activates the parts of the brain our ancestors used for hunting and gathering\u2014but which are largely dormant now as people rely on GPS to find their way around. While it\u2019s convenient, such technology could be doing the brain a disservice. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to our roots, rehearsing the spatial tasks that we don\u2019t get to do much anymore,\u201d Waddington says. And you don\u2019t have to spend much time doing it to benefit: \u201cA little goes a long way.\u201d In early data, her team is finding that even a one-time, 15-minute orienteering session might lead to gains in cognitive function. If your interest is piqued, Waddington and other experts recommend reaching out to a local club; there\u2019s at least one in most states. Orienteering events typically consist of three or more courses with varying lengths and difficulty, so even newcomers can show up, get a quick lesson, and test out a beginner route. It could take anywhere from 15 minutes to a couple hours to complete. \u201cYour goal is to navigate a series of checkpoints as fast and efficiently as possible,\u201d Waddington says. \u201cYou\u2019re moving through difficult terrain while trying to relate the information you\u2019re gathering from the map to what you can see in front of you.\u201d That\u2019s why orienteering is often called \u201cthe thinking sport\u201d\u2014it\u2019s like solving a puzzle. Almost anyone can give orienteering a whirl, says Ian Shields, 74, who\u2019s a member of Backwoods Orienteering Klub in Raleigh, N.C. Aside from the welcoming and inclusive atmosphere, it\u2019s affordable: Participants usually pay about $7 to register for one of his club\u2019s events, which includes the cost of a map, and then an extra $5 for a finger stick, a small electronic device that records your start and finish times. He suggests bringing water and a safety whistle, and wearing hiking gear and insect repellent. Read More: Rock Climbing Is a Thrill. It\u2019s Also Really Good for You Shields has lost some of his vision since taking up the sport more than a decade ago, but that hasn\u2019t dampened his enjoyment; he simply uses a larger map now. He regularly orienteers with people who are under 10 and over 95. \u201cYou can compete against a buddy who runs the same level of course as you do, or against your previous record,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can try and be the fastest in the whole group, or the slowest.\u201d He\u2019s not particularly speedy\u2014he jokes that the only way he\u2019ll win a race is if he outlives all his peers\u2014but he\u2019s OK with that. There\u2019s no pressure in orienteering. \u201cWe have one lady who comes out and spends more time photographing the flowers, and sometimes she finishes the course and sometimes she doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says. The benefits are clear regardless. \u201cIt keeps your brain working. I\u2019m certainly benefiting from it, because I actually get out and do something.\u201d Orienteering is like forest bathing, but with an athletic twist, says Clinton Morse, 61, who lives in Connecticut. He\u2019s been orienteering since the mid-90s and loves the sport so much, he retired early a few years ago to dedicate more time to it. He\u2019s now the national communications manager for Orienteering USA, the governing body for the sport in the U.S. Morse has orienteered in eight states so far this year. \u201cThere\u2019s a really good feeling to it,\u201d he says, including a satisfying mental challenge. Some newcomers worry about getting lost, but as long as you start out on a beginner course and learn the sport\u2019s basic tenets, you\u2019ll be fine, he says. \u201cThen you add intuition, and you can basically infer things from the map.\u201d Paige Suhocki, who\u2019s 15 and lives in New Jersey, started orienteering when she was 10. She was recently selected to represent TeamUSA at the Junior World Orienteering Championships this summer in Romania. \u201cThere\u2019s so many different ages of people,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are kids younger than me, and there are old ladies still going out there and walking it. I aspire to be them, because they\u2019re getting out in nature and getting exercise.\u201d (Plus, she adds, sometimes the older people beat the high-school kids, \u201cbecause they know exactly where they\u2019re going.\u201d) Suhocki believes orienteering has improved her mental and physical health in a variety of ways, including helping her learn to make decisions quickly. She\u2019s on the track and cross-country teams at school, but hasn\u2019t always relished running. When she\u2019s navigating an orienteering course, however, she doesn\u2019t even notice how many miles she\u2019s logged. \u201cI just go out, have fun, and I look at my watch after and I\u2019ve done five or six miles,\u201d she says. One day, when she\u2019s older, she\u2019ll make it a family tradition: \u201cI definitely want to get my kids into it. It\u2019s great to have something to look forward to on the weekends.\u201d",

        "title": "What Might Be Next for Misoprostol, the Other Abortion Pill",
        "content": "The abortion pill mifepristone has been on uncertain legal ground ever since a Texas judge ruled that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2019s approval more than two decades ago should be suspended. After the Department of Justice appealed the decision and requested that the Supreme Court step in, the high court decided that mifepristone should remain available while courts continue to decide its legal fate in a potentially lengthy appeals process. With one abortion pill in legal limbo, experts are now worried about possible threats to the other one: misoprostol. The drug is FDA approved to treat ulcers and, when used with mifepristone, to induce abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Taking the pills together is more effective and linked to fewer side effects than using misoprostol alone. In many parts of the world, however, doctors use misoprostol alone for abortions. Health-care providers can still use misoprostol on its own for abortions or to manage miscarriages in what\u2019s called \u201coff-label\u201d use, a common practice that allows them to prescribe any approved drug for purposes other than those for which they are indicated. If mifepristone loses its status as an approved drug, or if its use is restricted, misoprostol could become the only option for medication abortion\u2014and the next abortion battlefield. The unprecedented legal challenge to one abortion pill shows how the other might be similarly vulnerable. While misoprostol\u2019s approval as an ulcer drug is unlikely to come under legal threat, its use in abortion might. If that happens, aggressive prosecutors might decide to criminally charge people who travel to other states to take the pill. (The same could also happen to people obtaining mifepristone should that drug become restricted.) \u201cThere are laws that can be used to go after people who have had self-managed abortions claiming that it\u2019s fetal harm or child abuse,\u201d says Liz Borkowski, managing director of the Jacobs Institute of Women\u2019s Health at George Washington University. \u201cThat depends on prosecutors and how far out on a limb they want to go with this.\u201d Just as plaintiffs brought a case against the FDA questioning the approval of mifepristone, parties could begin to challenge the FDA\u2019s regulation of off-label use\u2014not only for misoprostol, but for any drug, says Lawrence Gostin, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law at Georgetown Law. \u201cIf the challenge to mifepristone is successful, it could open the floodgates to litigation against other drugs,\u201d he says. For health-care providers, that would be devastating. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely concerning when politics supersedes health decisions that are best left to the patient and provider relationship,\u201d says Dr. Umair Shah, secretary of health for Washington state. \u201cToday it\u2019s mifepristone; tomorrow it could be vaccines, and then Narcan, and before we know it, it\u2019s everything.\u201d Read More: Abortion Rights Benefit People Who Want Kids, Too Though misoprostol is not currently being challenged, states in which abortion is legal are trying to pre-emptively protect it. Some Democratic governors\u2014including in California and New York\u2014are stockpiling the drug to preserve access to medication abortions. Having supplies of the drug on hand could avoid any potential restrictions, especially on shipping the medication between states, that could come. Officials in many states are also \u201cmaking moves to say they won\u2019t cooperate with investigations of providers and patients who use misoprostol,\u201d says Borkowski. \u201cA lot of states are stepping up and putting protections in place recognizing that this is probably coming.\u201d In the aftermath of the Texas judge\u2019s ruling, for example, Washington state\u2019s legislature passed a shield law that prohibits cooperation when Washington health-care professionals are charged with out-of-state criminal and civil cases related to abortion, which the governor is expected to sign into law. It also passed a law prohibiting copays for any abortion care, bolstering an existing state law that requires state plans to cover abortion services if they cover maternity care. Such protections are an extension of those that many Democratic governors passed by executive order after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, protecting providers who perform medication abortions for people who travel from states where abortion is illegal. Even so, additional safety nets might be required to insulate misoprostol\u2019s use in abortion. New York governor Kathy Hochul proposed legislation in New York that requires private insurance companies to cover misoprostol when it is used in abortion; she is also taking additional steps to protect doctors who prescribe misoprostol by discouraging higher malpractice rates for them. In Washington state, legislators passed a bill assuring that reproductive health-care services, including abortion, are recognized as part of health-care providers\u2019 professional duties and not subject to any disciplinary measures under the state\u2019s licensing regulations. The bill is awaiting the governor\u2019s signature. While the legal fights continue, Shah\u2019s biggest concern is for \u201cthe impact and precedent this sets for other kinds of medications,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just don\u2019t, as a nation, want to go back to letting politics get in the mix of health decisions.\u201d",

        "title": "Deepika Padukone on Bollywood and Becoming a Global Star",
        "content": "Deepika Padukone never set out to take India to the world. She wanted the world to come to India. As the most popular actress in the world\u2019s most populous country, she\u2019s often asked if she\u2019s going to move to Hollywood. \u201cMy mission has always been to make a global impact while still being rooted in my country,\u201d she says on her home turf in Mumbai one humid morning in April, while on a break from shooting India\u2019s first aerial-action film, Fighter. It\u2019s fitting that Padukone\u2019s photo shoot for this story is happening inside Mehboob Studios, home to some of the most legendary movies made in Hindi-language cinema, from the seminal Oscar-nominated Mother India in 1957 to Padukone\u2019s own Chennai Express in 2013. The 37-year-old is now a legend in her own right. She has appeared in more than 30 films, won numerous awards, and generated nearly $350 million in global box-office revenues. Today, she is the highest-paid actress in India. Among her legions of fans and nearly 74 million followers on Instagram, Padukone is fondly called the Queen of Bollywood. Read More: How India\u2019s Record-Breaking Population Will Shape the World Padukone\u2019s 16-year career is an exception to the rule in Bollywood, the cutthroat Hindi-language film industry, known for prizing youth and continually looking for the next new thing. She suspects this has to do with India\u2019s growing influence in the world. \u201cIndian cinema has transcended borders and Indians are everywhere, so the fame goes wherever you go,\u201d she says. Buy a print of the Deepika Padukone cover here Smartphones, streaming services, and social media have helped find new audiences for India\u2019s century-old film industry, which tells about 1,500 stories a year on the screen. At the same time, Netflix and Amazon are also eager to create content that caters to a vast South Asian viewership of nearly 2 billion people around the world. But they are not necessarily looking only at Bollywood. The recent success of Telugu-language films like Bahubali and RRR has forced the question of whether Bollywood can still dominate the Indian film industry (which comprises many regional languages). All the while, tensions simmer under the surface as a rightward-leaning Indian government monitors the stories India tells about itself on celluloid. Padukone has been at the crossroads of all these forces, but remains unfazed. After all, she grew up in the enterprising city of Bangalore\u2014known as the Silicon Valley of India, and now called Bengaluru\u2014at a time when India was undergoing economic liberalization. Vijay Subramaniam, Padukone\u2019s agent, says she represents the \u201ctypical Bangalore girl\u201d\u2014someone with the world at their fingertips. In Padukone, we see a quiet trailblazer who makes her own rules, all the while embodying the feminine ideal that Bollywood wants to romance. She has emerged from the hopes and dreams of modern Indian women: someone with the utmost freedom to choose how she lives, works, and rests. Earlier this year, she charmed audiences at the 95th Academy Awards by introducing \u201cNaatu Naatu,\u201d the Oscar winner for Best Original Song from the movie RRR, as a \u201ctotal banger\u201d; she served on the exclusive jury for the 75th Cannes Film Festival; and she became the first Indian brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton and Cartier. She regularly makes fashion waves during her appearances at global events like the Met Gala and red carpets. At the shoot, Padukone arrives early, sending the production crew into a frenzy. She\u2019s surrounded by four bodyguards, two agents, two personal photographers, a stylist, makeup and hair artists, and a few more assistants. She poses effortlessly in front of the camera while her personally curated playlist blasts in the background, before her husband\u2014the larger-than-life Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh\u2014stops by the studio to surprise her. He\u2019s interrupting her while she\u2019s at work, but she giggles as the two hold hands for a brief moment. We head to the Taj Lands End hotel after the shoot, where we enter through a special entrance roped off for Padukone. She wants to gaze at the Arabian Sea while we talk, but the apologetic hotel staff informs her that our private room is on the other side, overlooking a construction site. She\u2019s OK with that, she tells them with a smile, and promptly asks her entourage to leave. Right now, her life is a lot. Sitting cross-legged on a couch, she contemplates her success. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a game plan for how to get here, but I didn\u2019t see failure on my vision board,\u201d she says. While she feels fulfilled, she\u2019s also trying to figure out what\u2019s next. \u201cThis is India\u2019s moment,\u201d she says. \u201cSo how can I marry the best of the East and the West?\u201d Twenty-one-year-old Padukone parades down a red carpet in slow motion in a wistful romantic sequence. She\u2019s wearing a magenta lehenga-choli, a slick bombshell bun, and full-winged eyeliner drawn to precision with killer dimples to match. It\u2019s her first Hindi film, Om Shanti Om, a campy, madcap spoof of \u201970s Bollywood, and Padukone has been cast alongside Shah Rukh Khan, one of the biggest superstars in the world. Nevertheless, she manages to hold her own. Khan, who co-produced the film, concedes that when he first met Padukone, he wasn\u2019t sure if she could pull off the role. Still, there was a sense that she was on the verge of becoming a star. \u201cEverybody knew it,\u201d he says. Om Shanti Om broke box-office records, and the two have gone on to star in four more films together. In January, they appeared in the spy thriller Pathaan, which quickly became one of the highest-grossing Hindi films of all time, earning $100 million globally. Another collaboration, Jawan, is in the pipeline for release later this year. For Khan, working with Padukone is like \u201cworking with family.\u201d Padukone might have been propelled into the limelight after Om Shanti Om, but she did not have a smooth ride. She was a complete outsider in Bollywood, where simmering tensions over nepotism finally exploded during the pandemic, fueling a reckoning with the advantages afforded to children of actors, producers, and directors who make it in the industry with ease. Meanwhile, Padukone didn\u2019t grow up thinking she would even become an actor. She was born in Denmark to Ujjala Padukone, a travel agent, and Prakash Padukone, a world-champion badminton player widely credited with putting India on the map in the sport. She played badminton herself on a national level, before leaving home at 16 to pursue modeling on the runways of Mumbai. \u201cFrom my story so far, there\u2019s nothing that indicates that I would have anything to do with the movies,\u201d she says. \u201cThe weird thing is that the few times a year my family watched a movie, I felt a connection. Like that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to be one day.\u201d  Where her debut film lent security and protection\u2014precisely because of its star power\u2014what followed next was a period of mistakes. Her choices were questioned after her next few movies struggled at the box office, and critics saw her acting as mediocre at best. Padukone is quick to accept the criticism, but also points out that \u201cin those years is this girl who was touted as the next big thing, but actually, she was only just figuring her way out.\u201d Anupama Chopra, a renowned Hindi film critic, says she began seeing an evolution in Padukone\u2019s acting with films like Cocktail (2012), Chennai Express (2013), and Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram Leela (2013). It culminated with Piku (2015), perhaps her most memorable film, an unconventional comedy heavy on bathroom humor. \u201cYou sort of took a step back and thought, oh my god, when did this happen?\u201d says Chopra. \u201cShe showed the world that it didn\u2019t matter how pretty you were or how many brands you represented, it was all about what you did in front of that camera.\u201d Read More: Bollywood Wages a Battle for Hearts and Minds In 2017, she dipped her toes into Hollywood, starring alongside Vin Diesel in xXx: Return of Xander Cage, an experience that allowed her to push different boundaries. \u201cWe speak in English all the time, but to act in English for the first time was so weird,\u201d she reflects. But her bankability as a star has also been met with fierce opposition, after the conservative Hindu-nationalist turn in Indian politics in the past decade. It first spiked in 2016, when she starred in Padmaavat, a maximalist period drama about a Hindu queen who becomes the object of infatuation of the Muslim Sultan of Delhi. Rumors of a love scene between the two characters drove Hindu vigilantes to light the film set on fire, while an official from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) offered a bounty of $1.5 million for Padukone\u2019s beheading, horrifying spectators. Local police detained the official. In 2020, Padukone was spotted standing silently at a student protest against an anti-Muslim citizenship law at New Delhi\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru University. Bollywood stars don\u2019t traditionally speak up or protest, so what Padukone did was a rare\u2014and risky\u2014example of a public figure calling out the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And in January came the \u201csaffron\u201d bikini attack over Pathaan\u2014when a Hindu-nationalist minister objected to Padukone\u2019s wearing an orange-colored bikini in a musical sequence. (Orange is considered a sacred color in Hinduism and has been adopted as a symbol for Hindu nationalists.) But Padukone is relieved to say she was genuinely missing in action when the controversy exploded days before the film\u2019s release\u2014she was simply busy at work. Padukone has remained studiously silent about these controversies, which haven\u2019t deterred her from taking up any roles\u2014including the role of a Pakistani spy in Pathaan. A long pause follows when she is asked about the constant political backlash. Padukone then says, carefully, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to feel something about it. But the truth is, I don\u2019t feel anything about it.\u201d India may be living in a \u201cpolarized cultural climate,\u201d says Chopra, but Bollywood\u2019s real crisis is one of storytelling and content. \u201cBollywood has lost its place,\u201d says the critic. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis of making better Hindi cinema that connects with the rest of the country,\u201d she continues, nodding to the perception that South Indian movies have, of late, better captured the zeitgeist than those being made in Mumbai. Last year, Padukone served on the eight-member jury of the 75th Cannes Film Festival, tasked with announcing the winner of the coveted Palme d\u2019Or award. Part of her job entailed \u201ceducating everyone around me that Indian movies are more than just song and dance,\u201d she says. But the opportunity equally made Padukone reflect on Bollywood\u2019s place in the world. She spent the two weeks in Cannes wondering why more Indian films weren\u2019t being showcased on a global stage. \u201cI would say that Hindi cinema has evolved, but we still have a long way to go,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we had a better moment?\u201d Until last year, no Indian film had won an Oscar, despite the Indian film industry\u2019s entertaining billions of people. Only three Indian films have been nominated for Best International Feature Film. Now, with the recognition of more diverse content, Padukone says India itself is beginning to realize that its movies are not just limited to Hindi films. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we should be happy with one Oscar for a song and one Oscar for a documentary,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope we can look at this as the beginning of an opportunity.\u201d With global superstardom at her doorstep, Padukone is aware of the importance of not losing sight of herself along the way. She is eager to be as authentic as possible\u2014which has also meant being honest with herself, and the world, about her personal challenges. In 2015, she became one of the few Bollywood actors to come out publicly about her struggle with depression. It surprised everyone around her, especially since she was at the peak of her career, having delivered three hits in a single year. In a country where the stigma around mental health hangs heavy and resources for treatment remain scarce, the admission had every potential to end her career. \u201cBut when I spoke about it, it just felt extremely liberating,\u201d she says. Padukone founded the Live Love Laugh foundation, now headed by her sister, which works with local communities to create awareness and access to mental-health resources. This year, she also launched her own cosmetics brand, 82\u00b0E, with the goal to talk about self-care more broadly. Her actions have opened up conversations about mental health across India, where an estimated 56 million people suffer from depression. \u201cA lot of other celebrities have spoken about [mental health] since then, but more importantly, a lot of noncelebrities have also spoken about it,\u201d says Anisha, her sister. \u201cThis is an illness that doesn\u2019t discriminate.\u201d Read More: Netflix\u2019s The Romantics Aims to Give Bollywood the Homage It Deserves Padukone is grateful for the support she has received over the years while laying bare her anxieties\u2014especially from her fans. \u201cThe beautiful part is that millions of them will probably never meet me, but they\u2019re still on the journey of life with me,\u201d she says. \u201cThey understand my body language, my expressions, my silences.\u201d At the same time, her drive for authenticity has made her conscious of not changing in the eyes of those closest to her. \u201cI will also give myself a little bit of credit that for whatever reason, I\u2019ve been able to keep myself grounded,\u201d she says. And then there\u2019s her husband Singh, who ripples through Bollywood wearing quirky outfits in public, playing pranks on his co-stars, occasionally posing nude for a shoot\u2014and always making Padukone laugh. The two have just returned from a holiday in Bhutan, where they spent their days doing what Padukone enjoys most: going on walks, sightseeing, and eating. With him, she is her \u201cmost vulnerable self,\u201d she says. Not long ago, Bollywood actresses came with a shelf life that expired as soon as they got married or had children. But that\u2019s changed, Padukone insists. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that experience because [Singh] has always put me, my dreams, and my ambitions first.\u201d Padukone married Singh in a private celebration in Lake Como, Italy, in 2018. The couple held two intricate Hindu ceremonies\u2014a Konkani ceremony nodding to Padukone\u2019s South Indian roots, and a Sikh ceremony that honored Singh\u2019s North Indian traditions. The wedding may have been small, but its glamour quotient was high. Padukone tapped India\u2019s most famous designer, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, to dress the couple. Being a Sabyasachi bride was a savvy move for a fashion icon like Padukone\u2014even today, the power couple\u2019s nuptials remain one of the most double-tapped posts on Instagram, inspiring the wedding aesthetics of Indian couples who form a $50 billion-strong wedding market. The payoff for dominating Instagram, as Padukone has time and again, is enormous, both for her and the companies that hire her. BoF reported the Bollywood star accounted for seven of Louis Vuitton\u2019s top 10 Instagram posts, generating more than 25% of the brand\u2019s $20.2 million in media impact value during the Cannes Film Festival, according to data analytics and marketing agency Launchmetrics. A single Instagram post of Padukone in a floor-sweeping red Louis Vuitton gown garnered more than 2 million likes and generated more than a million dollars in media impact value. The endorsements go on and on\u2014Levi\u2019s, Adidas, L\u2019Oreal, and Tissot\u2014brands that see Padukone as their gateway to a growing Indian market that was previously thwarted by bureaucracy. In April, Dior hosted its first official show in the country, near the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. But beyond weddings and luxury clothing brands, India\u2014the world\u2019s most populous nation with 1.4 billion people\u2014will soon become the world\u2019s third largest apparel and footwear market, predicted to be worth more than $83 billion by 2025, according to data from Euromonitor. If brands want to capitalize on a \u201cnew India,\u201d which Padukone calls simply \u201can emotion,\u201d she knows that stardom has placed her at its fulcrum. \u201cThere\u2019s the India with our roots, our heritage, our history, but there\u2019s also a new and young India that\u2019s emerging.\u201d It\u2019s almost time to go. In a few minutes, she will slip out the special exit with her bodyguards. \u201cIt\u2019s these two Indias coming together,\u201d she says, \u201cthat I find really fascinating at this moment.\u201d Correction, May 11 The original version of this article misstated Vijay Subramaniam\u2019s role. He is Padukone\u2019s agent, not her manager. Styling by Shaleena Nathani; Hair by Yianni Tsapatori; Makeup by Anil Chinnappa; Production by Keyur Lakhani at Imran Khatri Productions",

        "title": "Comer Swings and Misses on Allegations of Influence Peddling",
        "content": "House Oversight Committee chair James Comer aired details Wednesday of foreign business dealings by companies that he alleges benefited members of President Joe Biden\u2019s family during and after the years that Biden was Vice President. Comer provided evidence at a press conference that the companies received more than $10 million from foreign nationals and entities. He and other Republicans described wire transfers from those companies to several of Joe Biden\u2019s relatives, including to his son Hunter Biden, and said that the payments appeared to be unconnected to work done by the family members. Comer and his GOP colleagues on the House Oversight Committee further alleged that the payments, which included some from a Romanian national and a Chinese entity, constitute a \u201cpattern of influence peddling.\u201d They provided no evidence of President Biden\u2019s knowledge of the transactions and made no attempt to link the payments to any of his official or unofficial acts as a public servant. The House Republicans\u2019 press conference comes weeks after Joe Biden formally launched his campaign for a second term and is part of a broader effort to make questions around the business dealings of his son, Hunter, an issue in the 2024 election. Hunter Biden is also reportedly the subject of criminal investigations by the U.S. attorney in Delaware into his tax filings and a statement he made on a form to purchase a handgun. The declared purpose of the Comer investigation is to probe \u201cthe President\u2019s role in his family members\u2019 and business associates foreign and domestic business practices.\u201d To date, Comer has uncovered none. That isn\u2019t stopping the Kentucky Republican from continuing to try. The chair said he would soon issue a new round of subpoenas to banks and give certain associates of President Biden\u2019s relatives one more chance to voluntarily testify. He added that the Oversight Committee had asked the FBI to hand over by noon on Wednesday investigative records, known internally as an FD-1023 document, that allegedly related to Biden. Comer and Senator Chuck Grassley have said they learned about the document from a \u201chighly credible whistleblower.\u201d \u201cIf the FBI does not comply with our subpoena, then Sen. Grassley and I will discuss the next step,\u201d Comer said. Comer also specified the nine Biden relatives whom he alleges received payments, including Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, Biden\u2019s brother, James, and others. The new details build on Comer\u2019s months-long investigation of Hunter Biden and the president\u2019s son\u2019s business dealings in China and Ukraine. The facts so far suggest that Hunter Biden may have tried to profit off of his famous name, but there is no evidence that his dealings influenced his father\u2019s policy decisions or that President Biden ever made any money off of them. \u201cThe DOJ needs to get off its ass and investigate,\u201d South Carolina Representative Nancy Mace said on Wednesday. \u201cIf there are anti-corruption laws that need to be made stronger, we will also do that.\u201d Asked about whether the committee would apply similar investigative pressure to the business dealings of the children of former President Trump, Comer said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at everything when we get ready to introduce the legislation to ban influence peddling.\u201d Ahead of the press conference, the White House released a memo accusing Comer of \u201cusing baseless claims, personal attacks, and innuendo to try to score political points.\u201d But Comer sees it differently. \u201cI think the American people understand that this stinks and I think they appreciate what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.",

After all, when you belong to so many places, do you belong anywhere? But as my single mother once said: When you can\u2019t come home, you build your own.  Yet, despite our ostensive misalignment and our continued need to combat hate aimed at Asian Pacific communities, our diaspora has seen a golden wave of cultural and economic progress\u2014that has broken records and defined industries in short order. May 1st marks the beginning of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month. Each year, to spotlight the Asian Pacific diaspora\u2019s most impactful societal contributions, Gold House releases the A100\u2014our own TIME100. This year, journalist Alex Wagner, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, actor Ke Huy Quan, fashion designer Anna Sui, and baseball player Shohei Ohtani all made the list, which covers industries ranging from politics to business to entertainment to fashion to sports.   Media representation became the unifying battleground through , the first Asian-led major studio project in 25 years. In 2018, many studio executives did not believe that Asians were a viable market\u2014partly due to our 7% domestic population at the time. But by adapting successful galvanization models by Black churches in the late 80s and from women in the 2000s, several industry leaders jumpstarted with a promotional engine now known as , using theater buyouts and other viral tactics to guarantee that . Since then, #GoldOpen has ensured the opening weekend success of more than two dozen Asian-led films including, most recently, Everything Everywhere All At Once. Prioritizing market viability isn\u2019t new. Creators can come from anywhere but haven\u2019t always been able to go everywhere. Marketing has always been half the battle\u2014most easily evidenced by its percentage of total theatrical release budgets. YouTube was and continues to be the bastion for minority creators to reach the mainstream. In 2010, for instance, 25% of YouTube\u2019s top categories were Asian-led; accessible bandwidth and ubiquitous smart device distribution gave permission to niche creation. Beyond YouTube, a conducted by Nielsen and Gold House indicated that streaming platforms like Netflix have twice the AANHPIs of broadcast programs. And, of course, there\u2019s K-pop, whose listening share grew 65% annually since 2015 on Spotify and Apple Music and even more during the pandemic.   ",

        "content": "In her novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, the anthropologist turned storyteller Zora Neale Hurston wrote that there are years that ask questions and those that answer them.  Fifty years later, in the final weeks of 2022, one data point suggested the remain-and-influence strategy had its merits: Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, was elected the first Black House Minority Leader, making him the first Black person to lead a major party\u2019s caucus in either chamber of Congress. Read more: \u201cHakeem, in some ways, is an heir of all of that,\u201d says historian Komozi Woodard, author of Want to Start a Revolution?, speaking of the Gary meeting and what followed, especially the movement of grassroots Black activists into electoral politics in places like Jeffries\u2019 hometown of Brooklyn, N.Y..   Americans will no doubt hear Tuesday lots of talk about Jeffries\u2019 relatively rapid rise during his decade in Congress, an institution that Spencer Overton, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, says is one in which seniority typically dominates. But Jeffries\u2019 rise, Overton tells me, comes as no surprise to those who have been some like to call . Jeffries, 52, comes from socially and politically engaged people, and was a feature of the New York civil-rights scene during his career as a corporate lawyer. He brings a GenXer\u2019s ability to walk in many worlds, physical and digital, and, having come of age during some of the most difficult decades in America\u2019s major cities, he is part of what Woodard describes as the hip-hop generation\u2014a group skilled at making a way out of no way. Read more:  In fact, research and political experience tell us that get there precisely because of their facility for what their supporters call consensus building and their detractors are more likely to describe as accommodation. Others more rigid in their ideas about policy and process risk offending those who like things the way they are. leaders are most often installed in times of crisis, making leadership even more challenging and success at least a little less likely. And there remains the simple fact that just because a barrier has been broken, doesn\u2019t mean that everyone is happy about it.   \u201cLike President Obama, the image of Hakeem Jeffries, leader, could represent to some that they are losing what they think is their country\u2014as opposed to , in the collective sense, country,\u201d says Overton, who is also a professor at George Washington University\u2019s Law School. Look out, he and several other people I spoke with in December say, for the ways this alone will create license for Jeffries detractors to develop false claims about what the era of his leadership may bring, including attempts to recast Jeffries as a threat, an outsider, an other with secret aims. It\u2019s worth noting that, like Obama, Jeffries is a Christian and Black American with an Arabic name. \u201cHe could be racialized and demonized by some on the far right to stoke their base,\u201d Overton says, \u201cespecially if Leader Jeffries becomes Speaker Jeffries in a couple of years.\u201d Read more:   Jeffries may well accomplish much despite the headwinds. But in this scenario, a deeper level of deliberation becomes necessary to get things done. Obama had a political path Belcher describes as \u201crazor thin\u201d that he could walk, and had to be \u201cabove reproach\u201d in order to prevent the forces pushing at him from closing in. There were times where that razor-thin path meant certain topics could not be discussed. Consider the reaction to Obama\u2019s description of the wrongful arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., who is Black, outside the professor\u2019s own home. Obama\u2019s early comments described the police officer\u2019s actions as both unwise and connected to an experience many Black people have had: excessively harsh treatment by police. The reaction was so negative that Obama essentially took it back\u2014though by the end of 2020, thousands more Americans had been killed by police, a disproportionate share of them were Black or Latino, and police accountability issues led to protests in many cities\u2019 streets. Jeffries will face something similar, Belcher predicts. He\u2019ll have to pick his moments and his language with care, and there will always be some who are inclined to insist that whatever he\u2019s said or done or put forward is inappropriate.    ",

        "title": "Exclusive: Fumio Kishida on Plans for a More Assertive Japan",
        "content": "The official residence of Japan\u2019s Prime Minister is a spooky place. Inspired by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, the stone and brick mansion in central Tokyo had been around for only three years when young naval officers charged in and assassinated Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai in 1932. Four years later, Prime Minister Keisuke Okada was forced to hide in a closet during another attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, which killed five and left bullet holes that still pepper the building\u2019s Art Deco facade.      Read More: It\u2019s to Hiroshima that Kishida welcomes leaders of the G7 from May 19 to 21, when he\u2019ll hope to leverage the city\u2019s tragic history to convince the world\u2019s most powerful democracies that only collective resolve can face down the authoritarian threat of an increasingly belligerent Russia, China, and North Korea. Tokyo may be 5,000 miles from Kyiv, but has alerted Japan to a more perilous world, not least since Japan remains entangled in land and sea territorial disputes with Russia, and regularly sees flying overhead. Even more worrisome for Japan has been China\u2019s aggression against Taiwan, the self-ruling island that authoritarian President Xi Jinping has repeatedly vowed to bring to heel. When Beijing launched military drills last summer to protest U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei, five missiles fell into the waters of Japan\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone, through which Chinese naval vessels and aircraft regularly intrude. Against this backdrop, Kishida in December since World War II, mirroring upticks in defense spending across Europe, including Germany, which like Japan was humbled by that war. The commitment would raise defense spending to 2% of GDP by 2027, giving Japan the world\u2019s third largest defense budget. And while previous Japanese leaders dithered over imposing international sanctions, Kishida has joined U.S.-led measures with alacrity. Read More:   Kishida\u2019s tenure has already encountered drama that belies his reputation as a bland functionary. On April 15, Kishida narrowly avoided joining the ghosts stalking the Prime Minister\u2019s residence when during a campaign speech, injuring a policeman. \u201cI am living in the world of politics,\u201d he shrugs when asked about the incident. \u201cAll sorts of events and developments could happen.\u201d When he took office 18 months ago, he was thought of as a steady but uninspiring politician, unscarred by scandal but lacking major accomplishments. His father and grandfather were both lawmakers, and he spent part of his childhood in the U.S., attending a public school in Queens. Classes were filled with children of myriad cultural and linguistic backgrounds, and Kishida says he found communication \u201cvery challenging.\u201d But because of this, \u201cI was reminded of the importance of listening carefully to the views of others,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a child, I was inspired by what makes America the United States, which is respect for freedom and an abundance of energy.\u201d   But it has not all been smooth on the domestic front. Kishida\u2019s following a backlash to his decision to hold a state funeral for Abe, over both the expense and Abe\u2019s polarizing character. Late last year, Kishida over a variety of scandals. In February, he dismissed a close aide for saying \u201cquite a few people would abandon this country\u201d if same-sex marriage were legalized, despite of the population\u2019s supporting it. In response, Kishida tells TIME that he is committed to \u201crealizing a society where diversity is respected.\u201d Kishida\u2019s approval rating has since picked up, and his LDP won key seats in local elections in April. Read More:   Kishida\u2019s domestic agenda rests on a nebulous \u201cincome-doubling plan\u201d to boost household earnings, but his big problem is how to pay for redistribution without alienating the affluent. Japan\u2019s ratio of public debt to GDP \u2014about double that of the U.S.\u2014and Kishida has little wiggle room to keep borrowing. When he floated the idea of raising taxes on stock transfers and dividends, . \u201cMr. Kishida has to be pretty careful to keep key right-wing support,\u201d says Mieko Nakabayashi, a professor at Tokyo\u2019s Waseda University and a former Japanese lawmaker.  Read More: Ultimately, Japan remains than the U.S. Kishida has charged Japan\u2019s Digital Agency to cut red tape and boost efficiency. Digital Minister Taro Kono tells TIME that he\u2019s discovered 9,000 government regulations that still require handling via antiquated technology, such as faxes, floppy disks, and the hanko\u2014an iconic carved stamp that is obligatory for many official documents.  It\u2019s a different kind of existential threat that will occupy the G7 in Hiroshima, where posters promoting the summit adorn billboards and vending machines across the city, with countdown clocks inside the cavernous main railway station. Denied a seat on the U.N. Security Council, Japan has always placed great emphasis on the economic grouping, where it is the only Asian member. Close aides to Kishida say that welcoming the G7 to his home city will be the realization of \u201ca lifelong dream.\u201d Not only is it Kishida\u2019s best chance to catapult Japan to true global leadership, Nakabayashi says he also may use any bounce in domestic approval as a platform to dissolve parliament and seek a fresh mandate.    Read More:    Read More:    Washington agrees. In recent months, President Biden has committed to enhanced military cooperation with Japan, , , and Australia. He will be pressuring Kishida to assist not only with defense matters but also to prevent technology transfer to China. Meanwhile, Beijing has set about courting the Global South with a new forum for international relations, which the nation\u2019s state media has dubbed \u201cXivilization.\u201d It\u2019s a clash of worldviews that promises to keep heating up. Kishida\u2019s mission at Hiroshima will be to keep focus on the city\u2019s charred remains and paper cranes. To let the ghosts have their say.",

        "content": "Bobby Tudor made a fortune in fracking. The clean-cut financier opened shop in 2007 and spent the next 10 years backing large-scale projects in West Texas, supercharging one of history\u2019s greatest oil and gas expansions. But over lunch in February, even as he predicted that oil and gas would be around for the foreseeable future, Tudor offered a dimmer view of the industry\u2019s role in the region. \u201cOil and gas is just not going to be the same engine for growth,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt will flatten, and then it will decline.\u201d    These divisions are setting up a surprising, high-stakes fight. Tudor\u2019s coalition, the Houston Energy Transition Initiative (HETI), is organized by the city\u2019s most prominent business group, and its members are putting serious cash behind new energy efforts. But some politicians are pushing back, launching efforts to slow renewable energy and publicly vilifying environment initiatives. \u201c[Major oil and gas firms] may have supported us in the past, but they certainly don\u2019t align with us now,\u201d says Jason Isaac of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go and chase money\u2014and it\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d Read More:         Read More:    \u201cHouston was the right place because the world of made things is made here,\u201d says Troy Thacker, the firm\u2019s CEO.

Houston startups alone received $1.95 billion in venture-capital money in 2022, with energy-related startups raising almost as much as the next three sectors combined, according to data from the Greater Houston Partnership.  In Austin, I watched Jane Stricker, the executive director of HETI, present a vision of Texas as a capital of the energy transition to a gathering of lobbyists, regulators, and legislators. Her pitch: policy-makers should join with business leaders to speed the shift. \u201cWe can solidify our position if we really lean into our role,\u201d said Stricker, a former BP executive. \u201cWe have the opportunity to create massive economic growth.\u201d  Read More:    And then there\u2019s the anti-ESG rhetoric, a new front in the culture wars.

Just 10.1% of kids ages six months to four years have vaccine coverage against COVID-19. Part of the problem is the vocal anti-vaccine movement in the U.S. and a lack of access to adequate health care services. But another issue might be that the most effective pro-vaccine communicators aren\u2019t being used. According to a new study in the journal Pediatrics\u2014which focused on COVID-19 vaccines in particular, but has implications for all vaccination campaigns\u2014if you want to persuade parents to get their children vaccinated, the most convincing arguments may come not from health-care professionals, but from other trusted parents.

        "title": "The Charges Against George Santos Were A Long Time Coming",
        "content": "It\u2019s no surprise that federal prosecutors have filed criminal charges against Rep. George Santos, as CNN first reported Tuesday night. It\u2019s only a surprise that it took this long. Ever since the New York Republican hit the national scene last year by winning a congressional seat on Long Island, the lies he told about his life have been unraveling. His resume was quickly blown to bits, starting with a New York Times investigation that unearthed criminal charges for check fraud in Brazil, a phony Baruch diploma (he didn\u2019t attend), a fake job on Wall Street, and a bogus pet nonprofit. That was just for starters. Soon the world knew all sorts of other things Santos had made up or embellished: a Jewish background, a volleyball championship, the 9/11-related death of his mother, a producer role in the catatonic Broadway production of Spider-Man. A stream of acquaintances emerged to detail a staggering array of grifts: how he ran off with money meant to save a disabled Navy veteran\u2019s pit bull; how he nabbed checks and a Burberry scarf; how he siphoned campaign money to pay for what looks like a roof over his head and meal after meal at the red-sauce joint Il Bacco, to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he claims to have mysteriously loaned to his campaign. Santos\u2019s lifetime of hustling rivals the fake heiress Anna Delvey, with the international swagger of Frank Abagnale in Catch Me If You Can. Read More: All the Investigations Into George Santos. I started reporting on Santos in 2019, when I called him for a routine introductory item for Newsday, Long Island\u2019s paper of record. He was supposedly launching his first run for Congress, but said he was at a work conference in Miami, some 1,300 miles from the district he wanted to represent. That was the first hint of weirdness. In the years that followed, I wrote about his lack of a fixed address, his vagueness on biographical details, his campaign finance irregularities, and his (unverified) suggestion that he was paying legal bills for Jan. 6 rioters. For the past few months, I\u2019ve delved deeper into his activities and background for my forthcoming book, \u201cThe Fabulist: The Lying, Hustling, Grifting, Stealing, and Very American Legend of George Santos.\u201d Sorting fact from fiction for Santos was an adventure that took me as far as Brazil. After journalist Marisa Kabas found a picture there of Santos, dressed in drag at the dawn of the Obama era, the congressman told reporters that he was not a drag queen, but simply a young man who \u201chad fun at a festival.\u201d That was not the recollection of multiple people I spoke to in and around Niteroi, the city next to Rio where Santos lived on and off as he came of age. There was the family friend who said Santos was known as a drag queen. There was the drag mentor Eula Rochard, who showed Santos how to brush wigs and choose earrings, and who remembers Santos saying he wanted to marry rich someday. There was the young girl who once considered Santos an uncle figure, and who can\u2019t forget him dancing with her, wearing a bra and a towel on his head, to the tune of Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cBad Romance.\u201d \u201cAnthony is moved by money,\u201d that girl\u2019s mother, Adriana Parizzi, told me in April. (She knew Santos as Anthony Devolder, a portion of his full name he used before his life in politics.) As we spoke, Parizzi passed her phone across a table to show me texts in Portuguese in which she blamed Santos for absconding with her jewelry, while Santos called her a whale and worse. The public allegations against Santos are just the tip of the iceberg. I\u2019ve found three people on two continents to whom he raised the prospect of immigration-related marriages\u2014to himself or others. Family members say he has run off with money from close relatives, even mooching off his grandmother. \u201cHe was trying to get any type of money for free as fast as possible,\u201d one of his ex-roommates told me, recalling his time living with Santos in New York in the 2010s. The embattled congressman is a strange character to interact with, as if all his shape shifting has deformed his sense of how a person should or needs to move in the world. He can be charming, and he knows how to flash the impression of having money, whether it\u2019s the Cartier watch he claims is a family heirloom or the way he\u2019d ostentatiously pay for another bottle of wine at dinner. One brief past boyfriend, who was a dishwasher at a Florida surf-and-turf restaurant when he met Santos on Grindr, told me that this new friend seemed charming and high class: \u201cI was mostly McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bell. He was mostly caviar and fancy food.\u201d Santos seems to lie without being able to help himself\u2014whether it\u2019s telling fellow call-center workers in a dusty College Point cubicle farm that his family has property in Nantucket, or his bizarre public claim that former Democratic congressman Steve Israel, the one-time leader of the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, was going to vote for Santos, the first Republican that Israel would have backed in his life.

        "title": "The Charges Against George Santos Were A Long Time Coming",
        "content": "It\u2019s no surprise that federal prosecutors have filed criminal charges against Rep. George Santos, as CNN first reported Tuesday night. It\u2019s only a surprise that it took this long. Ever since the New York Republican hit the national scene last year by winning a congressional seat on Long Island, the lies he told about his life have been unraveling. His resume was quickly blown to bits, starting with a New York Times investigation that unearthed criminal charges for check fraud in Brazil, a phony Baruch diploma (he didn\u2019t attend), a fake job on Wall Street, and a bogus pet nonprofit. That was just for starters. Soon the world knew all sorts of other things Santos had made up or embellished: a Jewish background, a volleyball championship, the 9/11-related death of his mother, a producer role in the catatonic Broadway production of Spider-Man. A stream of acquaintances emerged to detail a staggering array of grifts: how he ran off with money meant to save a disabled Navy veteran\u2019s pit bull; how he nabbed checks and a Burberry scarf; how he siphoned campaign money to pay for what looks like a roof over his head and meal after meal at the red-sauce joint Il Bacco, to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of dollars he claims to have mysteriously loaned to his campaign. Santos\u2019s lifetime of hustling rivals the fake heiress Anna Delvey, with the international swagger of Frank Abagnale in Catch Me If You Can. Read More: All the Investigations Into George Santos. I started reporting on Santos in 2019, when I called him for a routine introductory item for Newsday, Long Island\u2019s paper of record. He was supposedly launching his first run for Congress, but said he was at a work conference in Miami, some 1,300 miles from the district he wanted to represent. That was the first hint of weirdness. In the years that followed, I wrote about his lack of a fixed address, his vagueness on biographical details, his campaign finance irregularities, and his (unverified) suggestion that he was paying legal bills for Jan. 6 rioters. For the past few months, I\u2019ve delved deeper into his activities and background for my forthcoming book, \u201cThe Fabulist: The Lying, Hustling, Grifting, Stealing, and Very American Legend of George Santos.\u201d Sorting fact from fiction for Santos was an adventure that took me as far as Brazil. After journalist Marisa Kabas found a picture there of Santos, dressed in drag at the dawn of the Obama era, the congressman told reporters that he was not a drag queen, but simply a young man who \u201chad fun at a festival.\u201d That was not the recollection of multiple people I spoke to in and around Niteroi, the city next to Rio where Santos lived on and off as he came of age. There was the family friend who said Santos was known as a drag queen. There was the drag mentor Eula Rochard, who showed Santos how to brush wigs and choose earrings, and who remembers Santos saying he wanted to marry rich someday. There was the young girl who once considered Santos an uncle figure, and who can\u2019t forget him dancing with her, wearing a bra and a towel on his head, to the tune of Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cBad Romance.\u201d \u201cAnthony is moved by money,\u201d that girl\u2019s mother, Adriana Parizzi, told me in April. (She knew Santos as Anthony Devolder, a portion of his full name he used before his life in politics.) As we spoke, Parizzi passed her phone across a table to show me texts in Portuguese in which she blamed Santos for absconding with her jewelry, while Santos called her a whale and worse. The public allegations against Santos are just the tip of the iceberg. I\u2019ve found three people on two continents to whom he raised the prospect of immigration-related marriages\u2014to himself or others. Family members say he has run off with money from close relatives, even mooching off his grandmother. \u201cHe was trying to get any type of money for free as fast as possible,\u201d one of his ex-roommates told me, recalling his time living with Santos in New York in the 2010s. The embattled congressman is a strange character to interact with, as if all his shape shifting has deformed his sense of how a person should or needs to move in the world. He can be charming, and he knows how to flash the impression of having money, whether it\u2019s the Cartier watch he claims is a family heirloom or the way he\u2019d ostentatiously pay for another bottle of wine at dinner. One brief past boyfriend, who was a dishwasher at a Florida surf-and-turf restaurant when he met Santos on Grindr, told me that this new friend seemed charming and high class: \u201cI was mostly McDonald\u2019s and Taco Bell. He was mostly caviar and fancy food.\u201d Santos seems to lie without being able to help himself\u2014whether it\u2019s telling fellow call-center workers in a dusty College Point cubicle farm that his family has property in Nantucket, or his bizarre public claim that former Democratic congressman Steve Israel, the one-time leader of the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, was going to vote for Santos, the first Republican that Israel would have backed in his life.

        "title": "RNC Floats New Criteria for First Presidential Primary Debate",
        "content": "The RNC is planning its first set of presidential debates since the 2016 cycle, when Donald Trump dominated a crowded GOP field on his path to victory. Recently, the committee has floated a plan to multiple campaigns for the first debate, scheduled for August, of only allowing candidates that are polling at 1% or higher and have had at least 40,000 donors, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. Former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who is now president of the Young America\u2019s Foundation, one of the organizations partnering with the RNC to host that debate, tells TIME those numbers are in line with what he has heard, though he has not formally been told the debate criteria and does not know exactly when it will be set. \u201cFrom the early discussions I\u2019ve heard about, without a final decision being made, there\u2019ll probably be some sort of criteria for the number of individual donors, because that\u2019s a good way to show that people have legitimacy,\u201d Walker says. \u201cAt the same time, though, I don\u2019t know that they\u2019ll be quite as strict as they once were in the polls.\u201d The RNC did not respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment on the record before publication. If the committee sticks with the proposed criteria for the first debate in August, it will mark a change from the first debate of the 2016 cycle. The first GOP debate in August 2015 was split in two, with a prime-time debate for the ten candidates who averaged the highest national polling numbers, and an earlier undercard debate for candidates that didn\u2019t make the top ten. The candidates with the lowest polling that secured a spot in prime-time were polling around 3%, according to a  In 2020, when Democrats had the crowded field of presidential contenders, the Democratic National Committee only permitted candidates on stage for the first debate who were either polling at 1% or higher in an average of 3 national or early state polls, or had at least 65,000 different donors, with at least 200 donors in 20 different states. The discussions between the RNC and campaigns about the first debate come as the GOP field is poised to grow. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is widely expected to jump in the race soon, and others, including former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, have strongly signaled they may as well. If the debate were held now, the candidates who would clear the 1% threshold would include Trump, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, and entrepreneur and author Vivek Ramaswamy, according to  Walker says setting the polling threshold too high this early in the race could potentially knock out qualified candidates who would otherwise have a shot at the nomination. A donor threshold would ensure serious campaigns qualify, he adds. \u201cForty, fifty thousand individual donors\u2014numbers like that are very realistic to say, \u2018Okay, this is a legitimate candidate.\u2019\u201d While some candidates may struggle to clear the 1% threshold, Trump is blowing the rest of the field out of the water. The RCP average finds that he has the support of a majority of Republican primary voters. According to the  \u201cI see that everybody is talking about the Republican Debates, but nobody got my approval, or the approval of the Trump Campaign, before announcing them,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social last month. \u201cWhen you\u2019re leading by seemingly insurmountable numbers, and you have hostile Networks with angry, TRUMP & MAGA hating anchors asking the \u2018questions,\u2019 why subject yourself to being libeled and abused?\u201d Walker thinks that it would be a mistake for Trump to skip the first debate, which the former governor anticipates will have one of the largest audiences of any debate until mid-2024. He tells TIME that not attending would mean Trump missing an opportunity to appeal to curious general election voters, especially in a swing state as important as Wisconsin. \u201cHe is a prizefighter, and prizefighters belong in the ring defending their title,\u201d says Walker, who shared the presidential debate stage with him in 2015. And if Trump doesn\u2019t show? \u201cI think people will still tune in, but I think the audience clearly is going to be much larger if President Trump is there,\u201d Walker says. \u201cNot only does it hurt the debate and the candidates, but I think it hurts him.\u201d For other candidates who qualify, the first debate will be a critical opportunity to gain name recognition and draw a contrast with the former president. But without Trump in the room, that could be a lot tougher. \u201cHe certainly knows that the media attention to this event will be X if he\u2019s in the room and one-tenth of X if he\u2019s not,\u201d says Rick Wilson, the anti-Trump political strategist who co-founded the Lincoln Project. \u201cHe\u2019s going to try to leverage his presence or lack of presence to make the debates inconsequential or to make it into a coronation. \u2026 I think what you\u2019re going to see is the kids\u2019 table. They are going to all go out there and desperately try to not say the T-word in the debate.\u201d  Asked who might have a chance to beat the frontrunner, Wilson pauses. \u201cGod?\u201d he offers. \u201cI mean, maybe. And I\u2019m not even giving him very good odds.\u201d",

        "title": "ACLU Readies Lawsuit Over Biden's New Border Control Measures",
        "content": "Tens of thousands of people are expected to try to cross the border in the next few weeks after the pandemic-era practice of turning most people away at the border without hearing asylum claims ends at 11:59 pm on May 11. Smugglers, Biden administration officials say, have been telling migrants for months they will have a better chance of being admitted into the US when those Title 42 public health authorities expire with the formal end of the COVID-19 public health emergency. To deter people from crossing, US immigration officials have designed  \u201cWe plan to sue,\u201d Katrina Eiland, an ACLU attorney based in San Francisco, tells TIME. For the past several weeks, the organization has been analyzing the Biden Administration\u2019s asylum policies and drafting legal documents in preparation for the federal response to the end of Title 42, Eiland says. Those new asylum procedures were published in the federal register on Wednesday. The 447-page rule tells people they are likely to be rejected if they seek asylum after having passed through another country without requesting protection. Asylum candidates are also likely to be rejected if they did not use a new U.S. Customs and Border Protection smartphone app, called CBP One, to make an appointment to request asylum at a U.S. port of entry. Officials with several immigrant rights organizations believe the new rules are overly broad and will lead to thousands of people who would otherwise qualify for protection in the U.S. to be denied asylum without an asylum officer hearing their case. The ACLU believes the new rule violates a section of federal law that describes how the U.S. evaluates asylum cases, Eiland says, and doesn\u2019t do enough to separate asylum seekers who have strong claims for protection from those who don\u2019t. \u201cWe think it\u2019s illegal under the asylum laws and is arbitrary and capricious for a number of reasons and that it will do grave harm and expose vulnerable asylum seekers to danger,\u201d Eiland says. That law requires an applicant to establish for an asylum officer that they have been persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An individual may seek asylum after arriving in the United States \u201cwhether or not at a designated port of arrival,\u201d the law states. During the Trump administration, the ACLU and other organizations sued and blocked two efforts to restrict access to asylum. In those cases, a U.S. district court judge in Northern California agreed the Trump-era changes were too onerous and the Ninth Circuit upheld those rulings. \u201cThe Trump asylum bans penalized people who didn\u2019t apply for asylum in countries they transited through before arriving in the U.S. and for entering the country without inspection,\u201d says Eiland. \u201cThis puts both of those requirements together in one rule.\u201d Kate Melloy Goettel, legal director of litigation at the American Immigration Council, says the new standard creates \u201ca huge obstacle for asylum seekers\u201d and \u201cturns asylum law on its head.\u201d The CBP One smartphone app, where migrants are urged to register for a time to appear at a point of entry to have their case evaluated, is glitchy, isn\u2019t available in enough languages, and \u201cis not ready for prime-time,\u201d Goettel says. The new law creates what is called a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d of denial if a person crosses the border between ports of entry or didn\u2019t try to claim asylum in a country they transited through. \u201cThat is not what our asylum law says. People can seek asylum at a port or entry or between ports of entry under our domestic law,\u201d Goettel says. Asked on Wednesday what Biden\u2019s back up plan is if the asylum rule gets blocked in court, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force One, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the legalities here. That\u2019s not something that I do. Certainly, if it gets there, that\u2019s something the Department of Justice will deal with.\u201d Biden spoke with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador on the phone Tuesday about the changes to U.S. immigration procedures at the border. Mexico has agreed to take migrants back into Mexico if they\u2019ve been turned away. Biden recently deployed more troops to support Border Patrol and is setting up centers in Colombia and Guatemala where migrants can check if they qualify for entry to the U.S. before traveling to the border. Asked on Tuesday if the US is ready for a surge of people coming to the border in the coming weeks, Biden said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be chaotic for a while.\u201d",

        "content": "From a root system up to 90 feet underground, to balloons floating 70,000 feet above earth, a series of recent audible insights are being showcased this week by experts gathering at the annual Acoustical Society of America conference. The new data revealed by these sounds are helping scientists better understand the natural world. For example, last year researchers  It\u2019s a \u201cchance to really listen in on a new world,\u201d says Daniel Bowman, a senior scientist at Sandia National Laboratories, a Department of Energy national security and technology lab, adding that this type of research provides \u201canother perspective on sound from a different vantage point\u201d\u2014in his case, miles above the ground. In a layer of our atmosphere far above where commercial planes soar, a group of scientists, including Bowman, have been releasing balloons to record otherwise un-heard sounds from the relatively calm region of our sky. Using low-frequency microbarometers they were able to detect what the earth sounds like from so high up\u2014from thunderstorms to wind turbines and freight trains. In a 19-day-long  Bowman hopes to use his findings to inspire others\u2014whether a middle school science student or professional researchers\u2014to conduct similar experiments to better study this little explored region of our sky. The balloons his project used are cheap, using $50-worth of materials, and easily constructed, and can be used not only for recording acoustics but for things such as aerial photography or measuring greenhouse gasses. (His experiment is also part of a proof-of-concept with NASA to explore seismic activity on Venus.) \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve explored every nook and cranny of the stratosphere,\u201d he says, \u201cso it still has prizes for us.\u201d There may also be lots new to discover underground. The world\u2019s largest tree by weight and landmass lives in southern Utah. Known as Pando, the 9,000-year-old aspen grove is a singular organism made up of more than 47,000 genetically identical trees. As a conference presentation detailed, the nonprofit Friends of Pando used hydrophones, underwater microphones, to  \u201cIt\u2019s similar to two cans connected by a string. Except there are 47,000 cans connected by a huge root system,\u201d Jeff Rice, a sound artist working with the nonprofit, said in a statement. Leaves rustling in the wind caused the hydrophone to pick up underground signals\u2014the more vigorously the leaves and branches shook, the stronger the signal. \u201cWhile it started as art, we see enormous potential for use in science,\u201d said Lance Oditt, the nonprofit\u2019s executive director. \u201cWind, converted to vibration (sound) and traveling the root system, could also reveal the inner workings of Pando\u2019s vast hidden hydraulic system in a nondestructive manner.\u201d The group hopes to use data from these recordings to study water movement, insect colonies, and root depth, among other things. That said, artistic interpretation of nature\u2019s sounds is, in itself, another valuable way of making sense of the world we live in. Also showcased this week at the conference, for example, was a percussion-based song  Sound is a powerful sense. Rainfall and lapping waves can calm us. Sirens send us warnings. And just a snippet of a song\u2019s chorus can bring back a lost memory. By unearthing previously inaccessible sounds scientists are now connecting us more intimately than ever to the world around us. And by turning data into music, artists can help us experience potentially abstract science in a visceral new way. Together, this can force us to think, and feel, differently about nature\u2019s wonders, and our impact on the planet.",

        "title": "France riots: Nanterre rocked by killing and unrest",
        "content": "Come to Nanterre to get an all-round view of the crisis boiling over in France. But if you are a journalist, be advised to keep your head down. An approach to a group of young men - some bearded, one built like a bodybuilder - outside the Le 35 caf\u00e9 prompts an aggressive outburst of swearing and a pointed finger directing me to keep out. At the scene where police shot dead a 17-year-old boy of Algerian descent last Tuesday, women in Islamic headscarves shout abuse at police and the media from passing cars. Wandering through the streets incognito - without a camera or notebook - past burned-out cars and smashed premises it is possible to pick up glimpses of the last catastrophic few days. Three middle-aged white ladies, Lucille, Marie and Jeanne, are chatting with a black male friend on a bench outside their block of flats. The area is pristine, surrounded by gardens - like many other apartment blocks in Nanterre. They don't want to be photographed as they fear their children would be identified and targeted as a result, but they are happy to chat. \"The last three nights have been appalling. Between midnight and 4am it is bedlam outside our windows. No-one can sleep. I feel like I'm living on another planet,\" says Lucille. Do they perhaps not feel the anger from the rioters is understandable, when one of Nanterre's young residents, Nahel, has been shot dead at a police check? \"This rioting has nothing to do with what happened. Of course, the kid shouldn't have been killed. But what was he doing joyriding without a licence at eight o'clock in the morning, when children are going to school?\" Marie looks at a smashed bus-shelter daubed with graffiti that reads \"one cop, one bullet\". \"You see what it says there? That I am completely against. I don't think the police are racist. There are good and bad in every group of people,\" she says. They have little time for the dead teenager's mother, Mounia, who took part in a mass march in memory of Nahel on Thursday. \"What was she doing up on that open-top van in the march? It was undignified. That wasn't a march of grief. She's playing politics.\" The others nod in agreement. Not far away on the Avenue Georges Clemenceau, lined with plane trees, the pr\u00e9fet who heads the Hauts-de-Seine department has come to survey the wreckage that was the front of the local tax office. \"Deplorable, lamentable,\" he says. Firework rockets fired by rioters at the building have left gaping holes in upper-floor windows. At street level, every pane has been smashed with a heavy instrument. Charred tax forms are scattered outside the entrance. Among the onlookers is tax inspector Cyril, who lives in Nanterre but also declines to be photographed. \"What I feel is just wretched sadness,\" he says. \"This tax office serves the people of Nanterre. The money that comes from here is used to buy them services. What on earth is the point of attacking it? It's a totally disproportionate response.\" Cyril, however, says he is broadly sympathetic with people who want to protest against Tuesday's killing. \"I'm not sure if racist police is correct. Let's just say they have an attitude. The kids around here have all had rough treatment, often because they were doing something stupid, sure. \"But look, this was a kid,\" says Cyril. \"The officer was an adult. He had a gun. It was his job to be in control of the situation. And he wasn't.\" There are far stronger views, of course, among locals who took part in the memorial march. Like Bakari, who doesn't justify the riots but believes they are understandable: \"Certain people react against violence with violence.\" \"I wasn't surprised by [Nahel's killing] because we have all had bad experiences with police. There are good and bad everywhere, but the large majority of police are racist.\" Or Yasmina: \"I absolutely hate the French police. I wish them the worst. The whole system is corrupted by a systemic, racist ideology. \"[Nahel] could have been my kid brother. It blows my mind to think that a kid like that can make some stupid mistake, like anyone could do. He didn't deserve to die.\" The town of Nanterre is far from the hellhole of isolated social deprivation some would like to depict. It is spacious, clean and two stops on the commuter train from the Arc de Triomphe in the centre of Paris. The towers of La D\u00e9fense business district are a stone's throw away. There is a theatre, a university, the national opera dance school, and a large park named after former President Charles de Gaulle's culture minister Andr\u00e9 Malraux. Unfortunately, yesterday the children's roundabout that has stood there for the last 50 years was burned down. The over-riding impression one takes away of the town is of two universes colliding. On one level, all the standard accoutrements of the generous French state are plain to see. Tricolours fly; the pr\u00e9fet comes to survey his domain; Metro trains whizz underground and, in the looming towers of La D\u00e9fense multinationals make their billions. But in the same geographic space, there is another way of being: one which appears utterly alienated from the system; which is quick to see and reflect hostility; which says \"ici on est chez nous\" - this patch is ours - and gives the finger to unwanted outsiders, like the press. At a petrol station by the tax office, veteran Paris-Match photographer Eric Hadj is surveying his smashed-up car and preparing forms for the insurance claim. \"We were here on Thursday during the march. Some big guys came and told us to get out. They made it quite clear we risked something very nasty if we didn't. When we came back today, of course the car had been totally wrecked.\" Hadj has been through a lot of riots in his time but says he has never seen anything like this. \"This is worse, far worse than 2005,\" he says. Everyone here is looking back to the last sustained rioting that shook the French banlieues or suburbs for three weeks, wondering how long the latest unrest will last. \"Today there is social media, which gives the rioters a big advantage. But, above all, it is more violent. They have rockets. Whatever restraint there was has been removed,\" says the photographer. G\u00e9rard Collomb, the former socialist mayor of Lyon and interior minister under President Macron, is well-known for his pithy sayings. When he left office in 2018, he lamented the worrying tendency of French society to divide into communities - the very contradiction, he thought, of a single, unified Republic. \"Today we are living side by side,\" he said. \"Tomorrow, I fear we will be face to face.\" In Nanterre it is one face of France against another.",

        "title": "Ukraine war corrosive for Vladimir Putin - CIA boss",
        "content": "The Ukraine war is having a \"corrosive\" effect on Vladimir Putin's leadership of Russia, according to the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Russian disaffection over the war is providing new opportunities for the CIA to collect intelligence, the agency's Director William J Burns said. America's top spy made the comments while delivering the annual lecture at the Ditchley Foundation in the UK. He was speaking a week after the mutiny by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin. Mr Burns said everyone had been \"riveted\" by the scenes last Saturday of Prigozhin's \"armed challenge\" to Moscow, when his Wagner mercenary forces marched towards Russia's capital. Prigozhin's actions were \"a vivid reminder of the corrosive effect of Putin's war on his own society and his own regime\", he said. The CIA director said the impact not just of Prigozhin's actions but also his statements - which included an indictment of both the rationale and execution of Russia's invasion - would play out for some time. \"Disaffection with the war will continue to gnaw away at the Russian leadership,\" Mr Burns said in his prepared remarks. \"That disaffection creates a once in a generation opportunity for us at CIA,\" referring to the role of the agency in recruiting human agents to provide intelligence. \"We are not letting it go to waste,\" he said to laughter from the audience. \"We are very much open for business.\" The CIA has recently launched a new social media campaign to try and reach people in Russia, including a video posted to the Telegram social media site, which is widely used by Russians. The campaign provided instructions on how to contact the CIA on the dark web without being monitored. This video gained 2.5 million views in the first week. Director Burns also reiterated the message other US officials have previously made in public that the US had no part in Prigozhin's mutiny. He did not directly address recent reports in the Washington Post that he made a secret visit to the Ukrainian capital before the mutiny. It was reported that discussions included the possibility that progress in Ukraine's counter-offensive might open the way for negotiations from a position of greater strength if substantial territory was taken. Mr Burns - who previously served as the US Ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008 - said spending much of the last two decades trying to understand Russian President Putin had given him a \"healthy dose of humility about pontificating about Putin and Russia\". But he added that one thing that he had learnt was that it was always a mistake to underestimate Mr Putin's fixation on controlling Ukraine. The Russian leader believed that without Ukraine, Russia could not be a major power and Mr Putin himself could not be a great leader, he said. \"That tragic and brutish fixation has already brought shame to Russia and exposed its weaknesses,\" Mr Burns said. \"Putin's war has already been a strategic failure for Russia: its military weaknesses laid bare, its economy badly damaged for years to come, its future as a junior partner and economic colony of China being shaped by Putin's mistakes.\" Turning to China, the CIA boss said it would be foolish for the US to attempt to decouple because of the deep economic interdependence between the two countries. \"China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and increasingly the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do so,\" he said. The US should instead \"sensibly de-risk and diversify by securing resilient supply chains, protecting our technological edge and investing in industrial capacity\", he added.",

        "title": "The man who helped Orban and Netanyahu rise to power",
        "content": "\"It's good to have an enemy,\" says George Birnbaum, one of the godfathers of modern populism. \"Very rarely will you find someone who's loved by everybody.\" A political consultant for 30 years, he helped Benjamin Netanyahu come to power in a surprise victory in Israel in 1996, and Hungary's Viktor Orban in 2010. He has clients in many countries, and flits nowadays between New York, Dubai and Harare. George Birnbaum built his reputation as one of \"Arthur's kids\" - under mentor and late business partner Arthur Finkelstein, a brilliant mathematician who re-invented the art of political campaigning in the US, helping Richard Nixon to power in 1972, as well as many other Republican leaders. \"One should\u2026try to polarise the election around that issue that cuts best in your direction, i.e. drugs, crime, race in New York State\u2026,\" Finkelstein wrote in a 1970 memo. \"When the opponent seizes the polarisation initiative, then you're in trouble.\" The duo scored a dramatic upset with Benjamin Netanyahu's first election victory in Israel, which came just months after the assassination of incumbent PM Shimon Peres's predecessor Yitzhak Rabin. Voters were electrified by slogans such as \"Peres will divide Jerusalem\" - in peace talks with the Palestinians. Was it true, I ask. \"'Whether or not it would have been a line down the middle of Jerusalem, I don't think that's true,\" he admits today. \"But there were certain areas of the municipality\u2026that were discussed as being given to the Palestinian Authority as part of a peace deal.\" In 2008, they began work for Hungary's Viktor Orban, whose right-wing Fidesz party won a landslide victory in 2010. Three years later, with more elections on the horizon, the decision was taken: Viktor Orban needed a new enemy - a man Hungarians could be told to fear. After copious opinion surveys, the duo struck on George Soros, the then 85-year-old Hungarian-born US billionaire and philanthropist, as a perfect target. Viktor Orban has vilified him ever since. \"George Soros was a good target,\" George Birnbaum tells me, \"Because enough people in Hungary didn't like the idea of this billionaire behind the curtain, almost like\u2026 the Wizard of Oz, controlling politics and policy.\" But did he really? In 2015, the year George Birnbaum stopped working for Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister discovered a new enemy: Muslim migrants. And when in September that year George Soros suggested the EU should absorb large numbers of asylum seekers, the Hungarian leader was quick to signal \"a Soros plan\". However implausible, the Jewish philanthropist was accused of a plot to destroy Christian Europe with Muslim immigrants - an idea already gaining ground on the far-right fringes of European politics as \"the Great Replacement theory\". Migrants became the feared \"other\" in the world-view of many Hungarians, replacing Jews or Gypsies. And the demonisation of George Soros radiated from Hungary, around the globe. \"Don't be afraid to call your enemies by their name. They will never show mercy. Consider for a moment George Soros,\" Viktor Orban told Republicans at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in the US state of Texas in 2022. \"I know George Soros very well. He is my opponent. He believes in none of the things that we do,\" the Hungarian leader told his American hosts. George Birnbaum's wife is Ukrainian, and the couple visit Ukraine often - as close friends of Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko. I point out that Russia's Vladimir Putin - who sent troops into Ukraine last year - has said that liberalism has become obsolete. The Russian leader loses no opportunity to rail against the decadence of the liberal West, multiculturalism, immigration, and human rights. Isn't that the West which Ukraine is trying to join? Which George Soros believes in? The war in Ukraine, George Birnbaum says, \"has reminded us why freedom matters, and why democracy matters\". If he met George Soros in the street he would invite him for a drink, he says. \"We disagree on a lot of things\u2026 But I would like to find out where are the places that we see the same future for Western democracy, for liberal democracy.\" \"I have a problem with the extremes on both sides, whether it's the progressive liberalism of the left or the extreme right-wing isolationist conservatism that exists on the right now.\" As for Viktor Orban, nearly a decade has passed, he says, since they last spoke. He admired him when they first met as \"a very intellectually smart individual, someone who had a deep knowledge of the economy, and other areas of policy\u2026 and that's rare\". Now he believes Viktor Orban has been in power too long. In January 2015, the Hungarian leader suggested that \"every migrant is a potential terrorist\". By July 2022, he had told supporters that \"we are willing to mix with one another, but we do not want to become peoples of mixed-race\". George Birnbaum disagrees strongly with both statements. His critics argue he foments polarisation in politics - but what is the antidote to this? \"The best kind of leaders are those who remind us of common goals, and not of our differences. It's not about ideology, it's about making sure that people's hopes and dreams are realised,\" he says.",

        "title": "Wagner: Russians reflect on group's advance towards Moscow",
        "content": "A week on from the dramatic mutiny by Wagner forces, residents in Rostov-on-Don - the city the mercenary troops seized - have been reflecting on the events that rocked Russia. In just 24 hours, leader of the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, staged an insurrection, sending troops into the city of a million people and further on towards Moscow. Due to the current laws against criticising the so-called \"special military operation\" in Russia, the BBC has chosen to protect the identities of the citizens who spoke to us. One Rostov-on-Don local - who the BBC is calling Vadim - described the moment he spotted Wagner forces in the city. \"I had to leave my home that day just to pop out and get something from the shop. About ten or eleven, I saw these armed people that had closed off the road. They were checking cars, asking people for documents but passers-by were simply allowed to carry on walking,\" he told the BBC World Service's Weekend programme. When Vadim got home, he started receiving calls from worried friends asking him if he was okay. He decided to stay at home for the rest of the day. \"If I am to speak of the feelings I experienced that day, I suppose you could say I was alarmed and perhaps even scared. We knew that Prigozhin had planned to do something and Wagner is known for its crimes in various countries. \"The association that we have of Wagner killing someone with a sledgehammer caused me to be afraid,\" he added. Vadim says the war in Ukraine has changed the city completely. Its become more militarised and has a number of military hospitals and wounded people. \"The city is really quite close to the front and that's how it feels.\" As Vadim sat at home in Rostov-on-Don, Anastasia was visiting Moscow from St Petersburg. \"We were checking the news together through the night and we woke up in the morning and there was even more news,\" she said. \"That was intense\". Anastasia, also a pseudonym, was staying with a friend in the southwest of the city, where preparations for the arrival of Wagner forces had started. She wasn't frightened that the troops would overtake the capital, she said. What made her anxious was the sheer uncertainty of the situation. \"All these things that seemed unreal previously, were beginning to happen. And it was completely unclear what was coming next. It was kind of scary, that uncertainty,\" she recalled. \"When Prigozhin started his march to Moscow, we didn't have any optimistic scenarios or what will happen. No one around me was happy about Prigozhin taking Moscow,\" Anastasia said. \"All scenarios seemed pretty bad. And the only thing that kind of felt hopeful was that something seemed to be changing. Some factors were making it possible to change. And then it ended.\" By the end of Saturday, Prigozhin called the advance off and ordered his men back to base. His troops had come within 124 miles (200km) of reaching Moscow. They retreated and by Monday, Wagner troops started leaving the city of Rostov-on-Don. Vadim said life in the city has returned to normal but everyone has been joking about the events of the past week. \"We've been saying that on Saturday there was a mutiny, Sunday there was a day off, Monday there was a fire in the zoo, Tuesday there was flooding because of heavy rain and on Wednesday there were some people fighting with knives.\" In regards to the political situation in Russia right now, Vadim says there hasn't been stability in the country since the invasion of Ukraine. \"You know there's a saying in Chekov that in the first scene, the gun is hung on the wall and in the final scene, it fires. And you reap what you sow. So none of this is very unexpected.\"",

        "title": "France shooting: Who was Nahel M, shot by French police in Nanterre?",
        "content": "The killing of Nahel M, 17, has sparked riots in cities across France as well as the town of Nanterre to the west of Paris where he grew up. An only child brought up by his mother, he had been working as a takeaway delivery driver and played rugby league. His education was described as chaotic. He was enrolled at a college in Suresnes not far from where he lived, to train to be an electrician. Those who knew Nahel, who was of Algerian descent, said he was well-loved in Nanterre where he lived with his mother Mounia and had apparently never known his father. His record of attendance of college was poor. Nahel had been in trouble before and was known to police, but family lawyers stressed he had no criminal record. He had given his mother a big kiss before she went to work, with the words \"I love you, Mum\". Shortly after nine in the morning on Tuesday he was fatally shot in the chest, point-blank, at the wheel of a Mercedes car for driving off during a police traffic check. At 17 he was too young for a licence. \"What am I going to do now?\" asked his mother. \"I devoted everything to him,\" she said. \"I've only got one, I haven't got 10 [children]. He was my life, my best friend.\" His grandmother spoke of him as a \"kind, good boy\". \"A refusal to stop doesn't give you a licence to kill,\" said Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure. \"All the children of the Republic have a right to justice.\" Nahel had spent the past three years playing for the Pirates of Nanterre rugby club. He had been part of an integration programme for teenagers struggling in school, run by an association called Ovale Citoyen. The programme was aimed at getting people from deprived areas into apprenticeships and Nahel was learning to be an electrician. Ovale Citoyen president Jeff Puech was one of the adults locally who knew him best. He had seen him only a few days ago and spoke of a \"kid who used rugby to get by\". \"He was someone who had the will to fit in socially and professionally, not some kid who dealt in drugs or got fun out of juvenile crime,\" Mr Puech told Le Parisien. He praised the teenager's \"exemplary attitude\", a far cry from what he condemned as a character assassination of him painted on social media. He had got to know Nahel when he lived with his mother in the Vieux-Pont suburb of Nanterre before they moved to the Pablo Picasso estate. Shortly after his death an ambulance man, Marouane, launched a tirade against a police officer, explaining later that he knew the boy as if he was his little brother. He had seen him grown up as a kind, helpful child. \"He never raised a hand to anyone and he was never violent,\" he told reporters. His mother believes the police officer who shot him \"saw an Arab face, a little kid, and wanted to take his life\". She told France 5 TV she blamed only the one person who fired the shot, not the police: \"I have friends who are officers - they're with me wholeheartedly.\" \"May Allah grant him mercy,\" read a banner unfurled over the Paris ring road outside Parc des Princes stadium. \"Police violence happens every day, especially if you're Arab or black,\" said one young man in another French city calling for justice for Nahel. But the family's lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, said this was not about racism, but about justice. \"We have a law and judicial system that protects police officers and it creates a culture of impunity in France,\" he told the BBC. Nahel had been the subject of as many as five police checks since 2021 - what is known as a refus d'obtemp\u00e9rer - refusing to comply with an order to stop. When he was stopped by police, he was driving a Mercedes with Polish number plates, with two passengers and no licence. As recently as last weekend, he had reportedly been placed in detention for refusing to comply and was due to appear before a juvenile court in September. His name was on a police file called a Taj, used by authorities for a variety of investigations. Last September a judge imposed a \"disciplinary measure\". Most of the trouble he got into involved cars: driving without a licence or insurance and using false number plates. But Nahel had never been convicted, said family lawyer Jennifer Cambla, and had no criminal record. Being known to police was not the same as a criminal record, because he had never been tried for anything listed on his police file, she told French TV. \"I think in this kind of suburb it's pretty rare that a young person hasn't been stopped by police or hasn't been in custody,\" Ms Cambla said. The riots that his death has provoked are a reminder for many in France of the events of 2005, when two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traor\u00e9, were electrocuted as they fled police after a game of football and ran into an electricity substation in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois. \"It could have been me, it could have been my little brother,\" a Clichy teenager called Mohammed told French website Mediapart.",

        "title": "France shooting: Calmer night despite protests over Nahel M's murder, minister says",
        "content": "France has seen a quieter night of protests over the death of a teenager shot by police at point-blank range, the interior minister says. There were fewer arrests compared to previous nights - 719 - with the worst clashes in the southern city Marseille. In the Paris suburb L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses, attackers rammed a car into the house of the mayor, injuring his wife as she tried to flee with their two children. French cities have seen unrest since the police shooting of a teenager. Nahel M, 17, was shot during a traffic stop on Tuesday. Large crowds turned out for his funeral on Saturday. In a tweet, Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin praised law enforcement for their \"resolute action\" which had led to a \"calmer night\". Around 45,000 police were deployed across the country for a second night on Saturday. More than 1,300 arrests were made on Friday night and more than 900 on Thursday. Officials hope that a turning-point may have been reached - that rioters are losing energy thanks to the security crackdown and the massive unpopularity of their exactions. However, until more nights of quiet confirm the trend, no-one is assuming anything. In Marseille, heavy clashes took place between police and rioters throughout Saturday evening. In footage circulating online, police can be seen using tear gas against people in the city. The video shows the clashes taking place on La Canebi\u00e8re, the main avenue in the heart of Marseille. French media report that fighting took place between a large group of rioters and officers. In Paris, large numbers of police were seen along the iconic Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es avenue. There had been calls on social media for protesters to gather there but the police presence seems to have kept most of them away. The capital's police said they made 194 arrests. The Paris region stopped all buses and trams after 21:00 for a second night running. L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun said his wife and one of his children had been injured when fleeing an attacker who had rammed his house with a car and then set the car on fire. He called it \"a murder attempt of unspeakable cowardice\". In the northern city of Lille, police special forces were seen on the streets. Images from the city overnight showed firefighters extinguishing blazes in cars that had been set alight by rioters. Twenty-one people were arrested in the city of Lyon. Clashes were also reported in Nice and Strasbourg. Nahel's funeral service was held at the mosque in Nanterre earlier on Saturday. Supporters of the family told the news media to keep away. All filming - even on phones - was banned: \"No Snapchat, no Insta,\" mourners were told. Nahel was shot after refusing to stop for a traffic check and died after emergency services attended the scene. A video, shared online in the hours following Nahel's death, showed two police officers trying to stop the vehicle and one pointing his weapon at the driver. The officer who fired the fatal shot has since been charged with voluntary homicide and apologised to the family. His lawyer said he was devastated. Nahel's death has reignited debate around the state of French policing, including a controversial 2017 firearms law which allows officers to shoot when a driver ignores an order to stop. More widely, it has led to questions of racism in the force. The UN's human rights office said the unrest was a chance for France \"to address deep issues of racism in law enforcement\". President Emmanuel Macron condemned the violence on Friday \"with the greatest firmness\" and said Nahel's death had been used to justify acts of violence - calling it an \"unacceptable exploitation of the adolescent's death\".",

        "title": "The false French riot posts spreading online",
        "content": "France has seen another night of unrest after the fatal shooting by police of a 17-year-old boy in a Paris suburb. Images of the unrest, which has spread to other French cities, are being shared on social media. As well as genuine video, false and misleading claims are also circulating, with the potential to increase tensions. BBC Verify has been investigating some of these. A striking image showing a group of young men driving a French police van, with one hanging out of the window brandishing a gun, has been shared on Twitter with the words \"France, photo of the day\". The tweet, posted early on 2 July had over 1.7m views but it's false - it's not from the current riots in France but is actually a still from a film. BBC Verify examined the image and, searching for previous versions of it on the internet, found it was from the French film, Athena - a fictional account of rioting in a city suburb - made in 2022. The people in the van and the blue motorcycle are exactly the same. The person who posted the tweet later clarified that the image was meant to be of an \"illustrative\" nature, but not before it had been retweeted thousands of times. He subsequently deleted it. Footage of cars falling from the windows of a multi-storey car park has been widely shared online, with the message: \"WTF is going on in France\u2026\". This is false - it is old footage and it looks like it has come from another film. BBC Verify took images of the video and carried out an online search to see if it had appeared before. The search brought up a tweet from June 2016, which claimed the footage was from the set of the action movie, Fast and Furious 8 - which was filmed in Cleveland, Ohio. Using the information in that tweet, BBC Verify located the footage to a multi-storey car park on Prospect Avenue East in Cleveland. The colours of the cars and the outside of the building match a scene from the film, which came out in 2017. Over the past few days, a video has been shared repeatedly on Twitter and the messaging app, Telegram showing a hooded man, on a rooftop pointing what appears to be a rifle. One Twitter user posted the video with the accompanying message: \"Rioter in France takes up sniper position with stolen police rifle.\" Another account claims the rifle was stolen from a police van. A Telegram user displayed the fire emoji next to the French flag and stated: \"looters covered by a sniper.\" The video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times across different platforms and accounts, and retweeted thousands of times. But the video was not filmed during the current disturbances, it is old footage. By searching for previous instances of the video on social media, BBC Verify can confirm it was posted on Twitter on 13 March, 2022. The man's clothing, position on the rooftop and visible buildings are identical in both tweets. It wasn't possible to confirm the exact location or whether the rifle was real or a replica gun. One Twitter user, aware of the earlier instances of this video, commented that the alleged sniper must have \"been there over a year now.\" BBC Verify is looking at other examples of false and misleading posts about the French riots.

        "title": "Sweden Quran burning: Iran won't send ambassador to Stockholm over incident",
        "content": "The Iranian government has refused to send a new ambassador to Sweden after a protester burned a Quran outside a mosque in the capital, Stockholm. An Iraqi-born refugee burnt the Muslim holy book outside a mosque on the first day of Eid al-Adha. Swedish police charged him with agitation against an ethnic or national group last week. Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, blamed the government for granting him the protest permit. Plans to burn copies of the Quran have sparked riots in Sweden in recent months. Police had rejected similar protest applications recently, but courts then ruled that they should be allowed on freedom of expression grounds. Muslims consider the Quran the sacred word of God and view any intentional damage or show of disrespect towards it as deeply offensive. Mr Amirabdollahian said despite appointing a new ambassador, Tehran would not be sending them. \"The process of dispatching them has been held off due to the Swedish government's issuing of a permit to desecrate the Holy Koran\", he said in a statement on Twitter. Iraq's foreign ministry also asked its Swedish counterpart to extradite the man who burned the Quran. They argued that since he still holds an Iraqi citizenship, he should face trial in Baghdad. After the incident, thousands of Iraqi protesters raided the Swedish embassy in Iraq at the instigation of the the populist Shia cleric, Moqtaha al-Sadr. They left after fifteen minutes when a security force was deployed. The prime minister of Sweden, Ulf Kristersson, denounced the raid on the embassy, but also said it was time for Sweden to reflect on its identity. \"It is of course completely unacceptable for people to unlawfully break into Swedish embassies in other countries. I think we also need to reflect in Sweden. It is a serious security situation, there is no reason to insult other people,\" he said. Following an emergency meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah on Sunday, the Saudi-based organisation called for member states to take \"unified and collective measures\" to stop countries burning copies of Islam's holy book. The secretary general, Hissein Brahim Taha said the burnings of the Quran were \"not mere ordinary Islamophobia incidents\" and urged countries worldwide to adhere to international law \"which clearly prohibits any advocacy of religious hatred\". Morocco, Kuwait, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates - among other countries - have recalled their ambassadors to Stockholm following the incident. It has also sparked anger in other Muslim-majority nations including Turkey - a Nato member which has a say over whether Sweden also gains membership. On Wednesday, the country's foreign minister tweeted that it was \"unacceptable to allow anti-Islam protests in the name of freedom of expression\".",

        "title": "Hachiko: The world's most loyal dog turns 100",
        "content": "The Chinese tagline on the movie poster says it all: \"I will wait for you, no matter how long it takes.\" It tells the true story of Hachiko, the faithful dog that continued to wait for its master at a train station in Japan long after his death. The cream white Akita Inu, born 100 years ago, has been memorialised in everything from books to movies to the cult science fiction sitcom Futurama. And the Chinese iteration - the third after a Japanese version in 1987, and the Richard Gere-starrer in 2009 - is a hit at the box office. There have been tales of other devoted hounds such as Greyfriars Bobby, but none with the global impact of Hachiko. A bronze statue of him has stood outside Shibuya Station in Tokyo, where he waited in vain for a decade, since 1948. The statue was first erected in 1934 before being recycled for the war effort during World War Two. Japanese schoolchildren are taught the story of Chuken Hachiko - or loyal dog Hachiko - as an example of devotion and fidelity. Hachiko represents the \"ideal Japanese citizen\" with his \"unquestioning devotion\", says Professor Christine Yano of the University of Hawaii - \"loyal, reliable, obedient to a master, understanding, without relying upon rationality, their place in the larger scheme of things\". Hachiko was born in November 1923 in the city of Odate in Akita prefecture, the original home of Akitas. A large-sized Japanese dog, the Akita is one of the country's oldest and most popular breeds. Designated by the Japanese government as a national icon in 1931, they were once trained to hunt animals like wild boar and elk. \"Akita dogs are calm, sincere, intelligent, and brave [and] obedient to their masters,\" said Eietsu Sakuraba, author of an English language children's book about Hachiko. \"On the other hand, it also has a stubborn personality and is wary of anyone other than its master.\" The year Hachiko was born, Hidesaburo Ueno, a renowned agricultural professor and a dog lover, asked a student to find him an Akita puppy. After a gruelling train journey, the puppy arrived at the Ueno residence in Shibuya district on 15 January 1924, where it was initially thought dead. According to Hachiko's biographer, Prof Mayumi Itoh, Ueno and his wife Yae nursed him back to health over the next six months. Ueno named him Hachi, or eight in Japanese. Ko is an honorific bestowed by Ueno's students. Ueno took a train to work several times a week. He was accompanied to Shibuya station by his three dogs, including Hachiko. The trio would then wait there for his return in the evening. On 21 May 1925, Ueno, then 53, died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Hachiko had been with him for just 16 months. \"While people were attending the wake, Hachi smelled Dr Ueno from the house and went inside the living room. He crawled under the coffin and refused to move,\" writes Prof Itoh. Hachiko spent the next few months with different families outside Shibuya but eventually, in the summer of 1925, he ended up with Ueno's gardener Kikusaburo Kobayashi. Having returned to the area where his late master lived, Hachiko soon resumed his daily commute to the station, rain or shine. \"In the evening, Hachi stood on four legs at the ticket gate and looked at each passenger as if he were looking for someone,\" writes Prof Itoh. Station employees initially saw him as a nuisance. Yakitori vendors would pour water on him and little boys bullied and hit him. However, he gained nationwide fame after Japanese daily Tokyo Asahi Shimbun wrote about him in October 1932. The station received donations of food for Hachiko each day, while visitors came from far and wide to see him. Poems and haikus were written about him. A fundraising event in 1934 to make a statue of him reportedly drew a crowd of 3,000. Hachiko's eventual death on 8 March 1935 made the front page of many newspapers. At his funeral, Buddhist monks offered prayers for him and dignitaries read eulogies. Thousands visited his statue in the following days. In impoverished post-war Japan, a fundraising drive for a new statue of Hachiko even managed to raise 800,000 yen, an enormous sum at the time, worth about 4bn yen (\u00a322m; $28m) today. \"In retrospect, I feel that he knew that Dr Ueno would not come back, but he kept waiting - Hachiko taught us the value of keeping faith in someone,\" wrote Takeshi Okamoto in a newspaper article in 1982. As a high school student, he had seen Hachiko at the station daily. Remembering Hachiko Every year on 8 April, a memorial service for Hachiko is held outside Shibuya Station. His statue is often decorated with scarves, Santa hats and, most recently, a surgical mask. His mount is on display at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo. Some of his remains are interred at the Aoyama Cemetery, alongside Ueno and Yae. Statues of him have also been cast in Odate, Ueno's hometown Hisai, the University of Tokyo and Rhode Island, the American setting for the 2009 movie. Odate also has a series of events lined up this year for his 100th birthday. Will the world's most loyal dog still be celebrated a century from now? Prof Yano says yes because she believes the \"heroism of Hachiko\" is not defined by any particular period - rather it is timeless. Mr Sakuraba is equally optimistic. \"Even 100 years from now, this unconditional, devoted love will remain unchanged, and the story of Hachiko will live on forever.\"",

        "title": "Load-shedding could switch South Africans off the ANC",
        "content": "South Africans are experiencing worsening blackouts as winter hits and the crisis is fuelling demands for political change in Africa's most-advanced economy. Wiseman Bambatha was indulging in wishful thinking when he named his business Goodhope upholstery. Mr Bambatha re-conditions sofas and chairs in a dingy, one-room workshop in the sprawling Khayelitsha township on the edge of Cape Town. But for hours on end, his battered, electric sewing machine sits idle. The power is off in Khayelitsha for eight or 10 hours almost every day. In South Africa they call it load-shedding. Orders are not being met, customers are angry. Mr Bambatha grimaces and admits his business is hanging by a thread. It is a story being replayed across the country. In an already dysfunctional economy, with half of all young adults unemployed, load-shedding is a jobs killer. \"The government has been promising us a better life for years,\" says Mr Bambatha, surveying his potholed street, and a vista of corrugated shacks beyond. \"Tell me, where is it?\" Khayelitsha is home to more than a million people. When night falls, and the power fails, it is enveloped in an eerie dark, punctuated by street-side braziers. Cape Town already had the dubious distinction of being the murder capital of Africa - load-shedding and the absence of street lighting has added a new level of menace. After sundown I meet Mr Bambatha's wife, Ruby, huddled on a sofa with her two young daughters, all of them illuminated by a flickering candle. \"I always try to get home before dark, get the kids inside and lock the door - only then I feel safe,\" she says. And even in death, the power crisis is robbing South Africans of their dignity. A man who runs a funeral parlour a couple of miles from Khayelitsha keeps bodies in a cold store behind his office. \"When the power is out for four hours we have a big problem,\" he says. \"The corpses start to decompose, you can imagine the smell. This is not something grieving families can accept.\" So the funeral director phones around his friends in the business. When he finds someone who has still got power and space in their cold store, he ferries his bodies to them. Across Cape Town, corpses are being juggled every day in search of reliable power. Load-shedding feels like the service delivery failure that could break the grip of the African National Congress (ANC) on power. The specific reasons for the rolling blackouts are legion: obsolete coal-fired power stations; incompetent management at the state-owned energy company Eskom and rampant corruption. But ultimately there is one stark political reality: the party of Nelson Mandela, which has monopolised power for 29 years since liberation from apartheid, owns this crisis. I meet ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula five minutes after power and light come back on at Luthuli House, the party's Johannesburg headquarters. He used to revel in the nickname \"Mr Fixit\". No-one seems to call him that now. \"Load-shedding could be our Achilles heel,\" he acknowledges, with surprising candour. \"It could cost us our majority.\" South Africans go to the polls next year. The poll ratings of the ANC and President Cyril Ramaphosa have been on the slide for months. The party is vulnerable as never before, but only if voters have a credible alternative. The leader of South Africa's biggest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), is John Steenhuisen. His Cape Town office gives clues as to the scale of his ambition. There are photos of former US President John F Kennedy everywhere. In a further nod to his political hero, Mr Steenhuisen promises me he will put together a \"moonshot coalition\" of a dozen opposition parties to bring down the ANC. But Mr Steenhuisen is white in a country where white people constitute just 7% of the population. Two-thirds of his party members are white. So too are 70% of the faces in South Africa's boardrooms. No amount of DA talk about competence and meritocracy can mask the fact that South Africa is not a society that has left the trauma and systemic inequality of apartheid behind. Which means that the most potent political force in the country right now may well be Julius Malema. He was thrown out of the ANC more than a decade ago - party bigwigs told him to take anger-management classes following a slew of accusations of inciting race hate and violence. He founded his own party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), committed to the nationalisation of land, the banks and the mines - in other words the key pillars of residual white economic power. Mr Malema senses opportunity as the energy crisis worsens this winter. \"Let the grid collapse,\" he tells me. \"I'm not wishing for it but it is going to happen, and then people are going to rise - I'm telling you there's going to be a revolution.\" The ANC has managed, or mismanaged, South Africa for the last 29 years. A day of reckoning is fast approaching, and it promises to be painful.",

        "title": "Zulu King Misuzulu kaZwelithini treated for suspected poisoning - aide",
        "content": "South Africa's Zulu King Misuzulu kaZwelithini is being treated in hospital for suspected poisoning, his traditional prime minister has said. The king sought medical attention in Eswatini as he is uncomfortable with seeking treatment in South Africa, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi added. This follows the sudden death of one of his senior advisers, also of suspected poisoning, Chief Buthelezi said. However, the king's official spokesman said he was in \"perfect health\". The monarch was currently not in hospital, and \"unnecessary panic\" should not be created, Prince Africa Zulu said, in what appeared to be an indirect reference to Chief Buthelezi's statement. King Misuzulu was crowned in front of thousands of his subjects last October. But a vicious power struggle has been raging within the royal family over the 48-year-old's accession, and tensions have also recently surfaced between the monarch and Chief Buthelezi. The Zulu king does not have formal political power and the monarch's role within broader South African society is largely ceremonial, but he remains hugely influential with a yearly government-funded budget of several million dollars. A faction within the family is challenging his claim to the throne in court, insisting that he is not the rightful heir of his late father, King Goodwill Zwelithini. They insist that another son of the late king, Prince Simakade, should be the monarch. King Zwelithini had six wives and at least 26 children. His will has also been challenged in court by his first wife, Queen Sibongile Dlamini-Zulu, and her two daughters. A court dismissed their case last year, but they said they would appeal against the ruling. There is no suggestion that any members of the royal family are behind King Misuzulu's suspected poisoning. The South African police have not yet commented on the claims. In his statement, Chief Buthelezi said King Misuzulu's senior aide, Douglas Xaba who stayed with him, \"passed on quite suddenly and that there are suspicions that he was poisoned\". \"When His Majesty began to feel unwell, he suspected that he too may have been poisoned. \"He immediately sought out medical treatment in Eswatini. I am informed that His Majesty felt uncomfortable seeking treatment in South Africa, as his parents had both received treatment in South Africa and subsequently died,\" Chief Buthelezi said. Chief Buthelezi added that while the king had recently appointed Prince Africa as the head of communications in his office, he, as the traditional prime minister, had an obligation to inform the Zulu nation of \"this worrying situation\". \"Our immediate concern is the King's wellbeing. We as the Zulu nation pray for His Majesty's full and swift recovery. \"Should there be any reason for further investigations, that will be attended to by the authorities,\" Chief Buthelezi said. In his subsequent statement, Prince Africa said there appeared to be an \"orchestrated agenda and a desperate narrative to communicate defamatory and baseless claims\" about the king's health. \"Ultimately, this creates unnecessary panic and perceptions of instability in the Royal Crown,\" he added. However, Prince Africa confirmed the monarch had undergone a thorough medical examination in Eswatini while visiting his uncle, King Mswati III. The checks were carried out because of \"our current times of pandemics such as Covid-19 and other dangerous ailments\", and also \"to mitigate against any untimely eventuality, given the reports of Mr Xaba's sudden passing\". King Misuzulu's accession to the throne was sooner than expected, and he has been at the centre of palace intrigue. His father died during the Covid pandemic in March 2021 of diabetes-related complications. He was the Zulu nation's longest-reigning monarch, having served on the throne for almost 50 years. King Misuzulu's mother, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu, then became the regent, but she died a month later. She was the sister of Eswatini's King Mswati III - Africa's only absolute monarch. At the time, Chief Buthelezi dismissed rumours that she had been poisoned. He had backed King Misuzulu's accession to the throne after her death, but recent reports suggested that sharp differences had emerged between the two. It followed a dispute over the chairmanship of the Ingonyama Trust Board, which manages vast tracts of land controlled by the monarch. The king appointed Chief Thanduyise Mzimela as its chairman, but this was opposed by Chief Buthelezi who felt he was inexperienced for the post, according to local media.",

        "title": "Deciphering Vladimir Putin's many appearances since mutiny",
        "content": "Where's Vladimir Putin? That's what we were wondering most of Monday - two days after a dramatic insurrection by the Wagner Group that saw a convoy of mercenary fighters headed to Moscow. A spokesman for Mr Putin announced a deal to end the Wagner mutiny late on Saturday. But when would the president himself comment on the controversial agreement? It was controversial because the Wagner mercenaries had rebelled, seized military sites (with apparent ease) and then marched on Moscow; Russian air force pilots had been killed in the mutiny. Yet the Kremlin had agreed not to prosecute Wagner fighters or their leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in return for calling off the uprising. Over the last week, President Putin has made a series of unusual public appearances - all televised - in an apparent attempt to steady the ship. On Monday we hear from Mr Prigozhin: an audio message posted online presenting his side of the story. He says his men headed to Moscow to \"hold to account\" those leaders he blamed for \"mistakes\" in the Ukraine war. Then late into the evening, an announcement is made. \"Standby: President Putin will address the nation.\" Now it feels like the Kremlin leader is playing catch-up. Putin appears on TV screens after 10pm. A late-night address from him is very unusual. Social media buzzes with rumours that this will be a speech that will \"decide the fate of Russia\". With trepidation we switch on Russian TV to hear the president speak. It quickly becomes clear this address will not decide the country's fate. There are no major announcements. But the five-minute speech does provide clues to how the Kremlin is going to spin the dramatic events of the weekend to its benefit. Putin paints a picture of a Russia that has united to defeat the treachery of Wagner's leaders. He tries to bring everyone on side: he thanks the Russian public, Russian officials, religious leaders, the Russian armed forces and his security services. He distinguishes between the leaders of the mutiny and regular Wagner fighters and commanders, whom he praises as patriots. Crucially, he presents himself as the man who averted major bloodshed. \"As soon as these events began to unfold,\" he says, \"in keeping with my direct instructions, steps were taken to avoid spilling blood\". Remember that controversy I was talking about? He doesn't address that. But, hey, Russia has stepped back from the brink. That's the main thing. On Monday he was playing catch-up. By Tuesday morning it's full steam ahead to try to restore his authority. At a hastily arranged event the Russian authorities are going heavy - very heavy - on the pomp and ceremony. Some 2,500 soldiers, Russian Guard and security officials are lined up on the Kremlin's Cathedral Square. This is the site of coronation (and funeral) processions of Russian tsars. Cue Putin: To the presidential fanfare he descends the many steps of the Kremlin down onto the square (red carpet all the way, of course) and with a backdrop of the onion domes of Kremlin cathedrals the president - and commander-in-chief - delivers a speech to his troops. But even before he starts to speak, the imagery says it all. It's all here in one place: the Orthodox Church, the Kremlin, the president and the army. It reminds me of the old Imperial Russian slogan: \"For faith, for the Tsar and the Fatherland.\" In other words, the visual messaging here is all about presenting Russia as a country uniting behind Vladimir Putin. It's almost as if they want Russians to think that the Church, the military, and the president are interlinked, even part of one whole. In his brief address, President Putin again claims that Russian society has come together after the Wagner mutiny. But most of what he says is praise for his military for \"stopping a civil war\". There's a minute's silence for the air force pilots who were killed. The president is paying his respects, but still not addressing the question of why Wagner fighters are not being prosecuted over their deaths. Speech over. Cue the national anthem and a gun salute. Overall message: the president's not only in charge. With the help of the Russian army and the Russian people, he's just scored a great victory. This is probably the most surprising Putin video of the week - perhaps of the year. That's because it's a very un-Putin-like Putin we see, in terms of getting up close and personal with the crowds. The official reason President Putin is visiting Dagestan is to chair a meeting on domestic tourism. But it's not the meeting that dominates news bulletins later on Russian TV. It's the crazy scenes that follow. The Kremlin leader is shown being mobbed by an adoring crowd in the city of Derbent. We've grown used to seeing Vladimir Putin keeping his distance from those he comes into contact with. Remember those long Kremlin tables with Putin seated safely at one end and his guests at the other? Not here. In Dagestan he's kissing children, hugging women, shaking hands and posing for photos. State TV laps it up. \"Screaming, squealing, applause,\" exclaims the presenter of a popular talk show on the Russia-1 channel. \"Even rock stars don't get this kind of welcome. The West is scoffing that after Prigozhin's mutiny the president has been weakened. This proves the opposite is the case.\" Putin's behaviour seems so out of character. On the other hand, nothing feels particularly normal any more in Russia. The Russian president had just survived an armed mutiny. Perhaps he feels the need to demonstrate - to the country, to the political elite, and to himself - that he still has supporters out there. A \"spontaneous\" expression of public adoration would fit the bill. As I view these images, I suddenly remember what happened last weekend, after the deal was done to end the mutiny. As Wagner fighters led by Mr Prigozhin had left Rostov on Saturday night, they were cheered on the streets. Has Vladimir Putin seen those images? Does he feel the need for his own \"hero\" moment? We'll probably never know. President Putin's attending a business conference on Russian brands in Moscow. It doesn't exactly make for another rock-star moment. Still, any opportunity to try to show (a) he's in charge (b) he's active (c) he has the support of the people. The Russian president is applauded as he enters the hall. He sits down and listens to one of the organisers deliver opening remarks. \"Vladimir Vladimirovich, along with you and the whole country we, too, lived through the events of 24 June [the mutiny] with anxiety,\" she says addressing Putin. \"We are all with you and we all support you.\" As if to prove it, the delegates give Vladimir Putin a standing ovation. From the same event, we see another slightly more bizarre video. President Putin is doodling on an interactive whiteboard. The result is a cartoon-like red face with three strands of hair. A curious picture from a leader who has learnt the art of political survival. Lines of loyal troops, gun salutes, screaming fans and a standing ovation. With these kinds of images, the Kremlin leader is trying to show he's back in control. He even has time to doodle. He must be feeling confident. Following the mutiny, we've witnessed a turbo-charged Putin this week. He was here, he was there, he seemed to be everywhere. It was almost as if he'd kicked off his campaign for re-election (his presidential term expires next year). But positive pictures do not change the fact that the rebellion had taken the Kremlin by surprise. It was a threat. The Wagner fighters had been well on their way to Moscow when the mutiny was called off. It was an unprecedented challenge to Putin's authority. And the long-term consequences of that are still unclear.",

        "title": "French teen shooting: Piecing together what happened",
        "content": "Prosecutors have begun piecing together what happened before the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Nahel M by a police officer. The officer has been charged with homicide and remains in custody. In their outline of events after questioning eyewitnesses and reviewing CCTV footage, prosecutors say the teenage driver had already ignored a police demand to stop, when officers caught up with the car and drew their weapons. Meanwhile an account has been posted online by one of the passengers, which French media say they have verified but the BBC has not. In this account the passenger, also a teenager, says the officers hit Nahel M with the butts of their guns three times, causing him to take his foot off the brake of the car. Prosecutors are due to talk to this witness on Monday. Here's what we know. Around 08:00 on Tuesday, two policemen on motorcycles spotted a Mercedes with a Polish number plate driving fast in a bus lane, Nanterre prosecutor Pascal Prache told journalists. Turning on their siren, the officers caught up with the car at a traffic light. Three young men were inside. The officers told the driver to stop but the vehicle pulled away, ignoring the red light. The officers gave chase and notified their unit by radio. At 08:16, the Mercedes stopped in heavy traffic. Both officers got off their motorcycles, drew their weapons and approached the car. They later told prosecutors that they pointed their guns at the driver to \"deter him from driving away again\". They asked the driver to turn off the ignition, but the car moved forward. One of the officers fired, fatally wounding the young man in the chest. After the car ran into a roadside barrier, one of the passengers was arrested and the other fled on foot. The passenger says the three friends were driving around Nanterre when the car strayed into the bus lane and was chased by two policemen on motorcycles. After Nahel stopped the car, the young man says in his video and in an interview with Le Parisien newspaper, one of the officers hit the teenage driver with the butt of his gun. He alleges that the second policeman also struck Nahel before the first officer again hit him. He told Le Parisien that the blows left Nahel M \"a little stunned\". The third blow, according to this account, caused Nahel to take his foot off the brake and the vehicle to move forward. After the officer fired, Nahel M slumped forward and his foot pressed on the accelerator, the passenger said. When the car came a standstill, the passenger said, he decided to flee because he was afraid he would be shot too. Questions have been asked about the car, a Mercedes A class AMG. Officials describe it as a rented vehicle. The passenger who fled said that someone had lent it to the three youths, without giving any details. According to the French motoring website Autoplus, German sportscars with Polish number plates can be hired for \u20ac300-3,000 (\u00a3260-2,600) a day. This type of short rental is popular with young men in French housing estates, Autoplus says. Nahel M did not have a criminal record but was known to police. He had previously been cited for driving without a licence - he was too young to have one - and for refusing to comply with an order to stop. He was due to appear before a juvenile court in September.",

        "title": "Nauru: Why Australia is funding an empty detention centre",
        "content": "Australia's controversial detention centre on Nauru is empty, after the last remaining refugee was evacuated into the night last week. It pauses over a decade of Australia's processing of asylum seekers on the tiny Pacific nation, with 4,183 people held there since 2012. Described as a place of \"indefinite despair\" and \"sustained abuse\" by visitors from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Human Rights Watch, the Nauru centre is a thorn in the side of Australia's human rights record. Yet offshore processing - which involves detaining people in the Pacific while they await resettlement in a third country - remains one of Australia's most enduring policies. Seven consecutive prime ministers have argued for its role in protecting the nation's borders and \"breaking the business model\" of human traffickers. Despite the facility sitting vacant, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government will spend vast sums of money - including A$486m (\u00a3255m; $320m) this year - to keep Nauru open as a deterrent. Maria knows what it feels like to be airlifted off Nauru at short notice. She was evacuated to Sydney in 2014 due to a severe kidney issue, after being detained on the island for over a year. A survivor of female genital mutilation from Somalia, Maria escaped civil war before making a weeks-long journey by plane, and then boat, to Australia. \"Just promise me: don't die,\" her younger brother had pleaded as she left the family home for the last time. \"That broke me\u2026 because we have lots of neighbours and cousins who have died in the Mediterranean,\" says Maria, who does not want to give her surname. Her time at sea felt \"never ending\", Maria tells the BBC. The boat was tiny \"like a kayak\" and its dozens of passengers had no toilet. \"I was hallucinating because I was so sick. I kept thinking about my brother. And how I didn't want to lie to him.\" Eventually they were picked up by the Australian Navy - and ultimately transferred to Nauru. Maria's memories of the island are vivid and intense. She describes having cut up and burnt feet after walking on sharp stones without shoes in searing heat. The humidity left her tent covered in \"green and black mould which grew on everything\", she adds. She learnt to move in groups and ignore public sexual propositions from men within the camp. \"Dehumanising\" treatment, such as being watched in the shower or rationed out sanitary pads by guards, became the norm, Maria says. \"There were a lot of inappropriate relationships between the guards and the girls. You're a refugee, but they looked at you like you were in a prison.\" After leaving Nauru, Maria was detained in Sydney, before finally being released on a bridging visa. She now runs a business in Brisbane, where she lives with her Australian husband and two children. But her visa requires renewal every six months and she lives in terror of being taken away from her family and placed back in detention. \"It's limbo. I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.\" Countless refugees have shared stories of suffering like Maria's since offshore processing began in 2001. It was introduced by a conservative prime minister, John Howard. When he left office in 2007, the policy was suspended by Kevin Rudd's Labor government, before being resumed - also under Labor - in 2012, initially as a stop-gap measure following a spike in boat crossings. Successive politicians defended the policy as key to protecting Australia's borders and saving lives at sea. But researchers have argued it did little to curb either maritime arrivals or deaths. Both dropped from 2014 onwards, when the government quietly shifted to boat \"turnbacks\" - an approach that removes migrant vessels from Australian waters and sends those on board back to their countries of departure. All new arrivals to the offshore detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island in Papua New Guinea (PNG) ceased after that pivot. And since then, \"Australia has spent considerable effort and money trying unsuccessfully to extract itself from its arrangements in Nauru and PNG,\" a 2021 review of offshore detention from the Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law found. Mounting accusations of health crises among detainees prompted Australia to evacuate people from the islands under a special legislative scheme. As a result, everyone has been taken off Nauru, but 80 people formerly detained by the government remain \"trapped\" in PNG, according to the Human Rights Law Centre. Over the past decade, every expert UN body tasked with reviewing offshore processing has expressed concerns about the policy. Fourteen people have died in detention, about half through suicide. In 2020, the International Criminal Court (ICC) called Australia's policies unlawful and degrading but said they did not warrant prosecution. Despite quietly shifting away from offshore processing, Australia recently signed a A$422m contract with a US prison company to oversee Nauru until at least 2025. \"The enduring capability ensures regional processing arrangements remain ready to receive and process any new unauthorised maritime arrivals, future-proofing Australia's response to maritime people smuggling,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said. Mr Albanese has not commented on the last detainee leaving Nauru. His government has described its asylum seekers policies as \"tough on borders, not weak on humanity\". Critics argue offshore processing will remain a costly bipartisan policy on paper as long as \"refugees are being used to try and win votes\". \"People seeking asylum by sea have been weaponised and politicised over decades in Australia,\" says Jana Favero, director of advocacy at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. But Ms Favero and other critics believe public sentiment towards \"deterrence-based\" border control is shifting. She celebrates the last evacuation from Nauru as a \"long overdue move for refugees\" borne out of \"tireless advocacy\". \"What we saw at the last election was a rejection of fear-based politics,\" she says. Polling seems to capture some shift in attitudes towards immigration. In 2017, when asked whether refugees in Nauru and PNG should be allowed to settle in Australia, 45% agreed while 48% said no, according to the Lowy Institute think tank. This year, its polling found 68% agreed that \"openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation\", a 15-point increase from 2018. Maria, who has found herself caught in the crosshairs of the government's policy, says life for now is about co-existing with uncertainty - because so little has changed over time. \"It's been 10 years already\u2026 at this point, I feel like I'm used to it,\" she explains. \"I live my life as much as I can... but there are some days when I'm overwhelmed, and I think why me?\"",

        "title": "David Bowie's 1983 shows in Milton Keynes remembered",
        "content": "Forty years ago this weekend tens of thousands of fans gathered to watch David Bowie play three nights at a converted clay pit in the Buckinghamshire countryside. Fans who witnessed the gigs, from front and back of stage, spoke to the BBC about their memories. They came in their thousands from all across the country - with extra train services and coaches laid on to deal with the demand. More than 150,000 descended on the National Bowl in Milton Keynes that sweltering weekend in July 1983, on a tour that saw Bowie play his first live gigs in England in five years. I was among them. My journey, aged 15 and accompanied by a school friend, was on a coach from Cornwall. I didn't know it then, but we were about to witness the artist's transformation to a new level of global superstar. Alongside the die-hard Bowie fans, ska and reggae lovers had turned out to see support act The Beat, joining new romantics, punks and even a contingency of Hell's Angels, from memory. Bowie's new persona seemed to appeal to everyone, and it felt like half the country was there. The three dates, from 1 to 3 July, had been added to the end of the European leg of his Serious Moonlight tour, due to massive demand for tickets following the success of the Let's Dance album and its hit singles, including the title track. The nine-month tour had \"snowballed\", said official photographer Denis O'Regan, eventually featuring 99 dates in over 60 cities across the globe, including a series of massive open-air concerts. The photographer said he had been inspired to work with Bowie after seeing him a decade earlier at the famous Hammersmith Odeon concert, the night before the Bowie retired his Ziggy Stardust incarnation. \"That gig really changed my whole life,\" he said. \"I decided I wanted to go on tour with David Bowie, I also wanted to tour with the Rolling Stones, because they were the biggest band and I wanted to tour with Queen, because they were great, and I ended up touring with them all. \"I approached David with a business plan to produce a book of the tour, which he really liked.\" An early assumption the artist would keep him at arms length, being protective of his image, turned out to be the opposite, he explained. \"He was a very, very warm person and wanted to engage really easily with what I was doing, wanting me to cover every moment.\" His photographs document the transformation of the artist \"from the inside\", he said, \"it was an amazing time to be with him.\" As the tour progressed the photographer said he had to come up with different ways of shooting the star \"to hold David's interest\". \"If it was a shot of the live performance, it had to be very special,\" he said. \"At Milton Keynes, instead of the audience disappearing over the horizon they rise up in front of you, and that's what gave it that epic look.\" The resulting images were featured in US magazines Newsweek and Time \"and of course gave this impression of David being an enormous star playing to huge crowds so that really had quite an effect,\" he said. \"The rest of the world, especially America where David wasn't so big, saw this all happening and suddenly they wanted him, because they were booking into stadiums as well, so the tour took on a different level of magnitude and became a huge thing.\" An 18-year-old Chris Wilson had driven from Norfolk with friends for the first of the three dates, the day after finishing his A level exams. \"The day is still singed on my memory; we had pictures of Bowie stuck in the windows in the back of the car; that's how excited we were,\" he said. \"My god, he was on form and just looked amazing. He was shining and golden, the staging was magical. \"I just remember it being utterly euphoric because we'd waited so long to see him. \"His genius was, even in a massive crowd like that, you felt like he was singing to you, he was looking at you.\" A Manchester University student at the time, Dr Joan Keating said she had gone to the gig with friends as a birthday treat. \"I made a strapless dress out of yellow broderie anglaise and wore it with elbow length white lace gloves,\" she said. \"I remember that Bowie was very far away from the section that we were in, but that I felt grown up and glamorous and somehow in exactly the place that I was meant to be as a 20-year-old textiles student. \"I can still 'feel' the music.\" To a 16-year-old Nick De Marco, attending the gig with school friends from London had felt like a \"big expedition\". \"There were so many tens of thousands of people ahead of us, and all being young kids we didn't really think of getting to the front, but it was all very exciting,\" he said. \"But it is incredible when you do see the pictures of the enormity of that gig, and you just think, god, I was in there somewhere.\" Like many of us he also remembered the slow train journey back to London, arriving at Euston in the early hours. \"There was no way we could get home, so we all just slept on the concourse, it was full of hundreds of people doing the same thing,\" said Mr De Marco, who is now a lawyer. \"It was like there had been an earthquake or something.\" A 15-year-old Sam Rosser had travelled from Staffordshire for the gig, and said she felt \"slightly hysterical\" at times. \"I will never, ever forget that day, ever. I feel so lucky to have had that experience. I miss him so much.\" Dave Willis, then 17 years old and living in Woking in Surrey, describes phoning in sick to his employers in order to go to the concert with a colleague. \"Being provincial boys, we used to go to civic halls and leisure centres to see bands, so the thought of going to this great big bowl to see Bowie, and The Beat was just great,\" he said. \"It was so hot and of course we hadn't taken anything with us - we just got there and got down the front and then had to stay there, so we just spent all day in the sun with nothing to drink. \"I remember everything just being brilliant; every act was on point, and he came on and just blew everyone away.\" O'Regan now has a gallery in Hammersmith in west London, where he exhibits and sells limited edition prints and his published photography books, and looks back with great fondness at the time he spent with Bowie. \"On the tour we would have a slide show in my room once I got the pictures developed [as used to happen with rolls of camera film], and I really used to enjoy that,\" he said. \"I used to love it just me and David, and we often used to go out just me and him. \"It was way beyond what I ever expected. I knew at the time how lucky I was.\" Ricochet: David Bowie 1983, Denis O'Regan's deluxe box set including five books, signed and numbered prints, and exclusive vinyl, will soon be available to buy individually in unboxed collections. As the person who has photographed Bowie more than anyone, O'Regan is also working on a new book detailing his photographs of the artist across a 20-year period.

        "title": "Sex life of rare 'leopard-print' frog revealed",
        "content": "Scientists have braved 50C heat and poisonous snakes to track down a \"leopard-print\" frog virtually unknown to science and learn how it reproduces. Argentinian conservation scientists are fighting to protect the tiny Santa Fe frog, which is under threat as its habitat in one of the world's driest forests, the Dry Chaco, is cut down. They discovered it hides in caves, emerging only to call for a mate. And for the first time they found tadpoles of the species. \"It's not been an easy journey so far, but we're determined to do what we can to secure the future for this wonderful amphibian,\" said Isis Iba\u00f1ez, who leads the Santa Fe frog project, based in Buenos Aires. The Santa Fe frog (Leptodactylus laticeps) is largely unknown to science despite being discovered more than a century ago. Found only in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay, the frog is now rare due to the loss of the tropical dry forests in which it lives. The researchers set up camera traps to locate the brightly-coloured frogs and study their behaviour. Most frogs attract a mate by calling loudly from a pond, stream or swamp, but this species lives underground. The team found the males emerged at nightfall to advertise their presence, then hopped back down their burrows with interested females. After digging for hours at night they eventually found evidence of eggs and tadpoles for the first time. Investigating the frog's breeding behaviour is the first step towards protecting it in the wild. By drawing attention to the plight of the frog the conservation scientists hope to highlight the biodiversity of the Dry (or Grand) Chaco - and other animals at risk of extinction. \"This species is a clear example of why we have to defend the forest in the Dry Chaco,\" said team member, Camila Deutsch. \"We don't have much time.\" The scientists are also liaising with local community leaders, hunters and farmers to learn more about the frog and how to better protect it. The Grand Chaco is a large expanse of forest and dusty plains straddling parts of Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay. The Chaco woodlands have been gradually cleared over the past few decades to make way for cropland and ranches. The forest has one of the highest deforestation rates on the planet though it attracts less attention than its Amazon neighbour. The area has been dubbed \"El Impenetrable\" and even \"hell on Earth\" for its inaccessibility and extreme temperatures. Temperatures can reach 50C in the daytime and there is very little rainfall. Yet wildlife thrives in the harsh conditions, including hundreds of different birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians. \"It's a dry forest with an incredible biodiversity,\" said Gabriela Agostini. Amphibians are at high risk of extinction. A pathogenic fungus has been ravaging populations around the world for about 40 years. The animals are also under pressure from habitat loss and hunting. The Santa Fe frog project is supported by the Conservation Leadership Programme (CLP) - an initiative run by Fauna & Flora, BirdLife International and the Wildlife Conservation Society.

        "title": "California reparations: How do you put a price on racism?",
        "content": "Alvin Taylor and his sister, Pearl, were kids when the City of Palm Springs, California began burning down their neighbours' homes. But they still remember the smell of the smoke. \"We would come home, and a neighbour's house would be gone - just burned rubble,\" Pearl Taylor Devers said. In 1965, the City of Palm Springs began razing the Taylor's predominately black neighbourhood to make way for commercial development near the city centre. Their father, a carpenter, had built their modest home from the foundation up. Their mother, a house cleaner, worked for celebrities like Lucille Ball and Amelia Earnhardt and took the children to church every Sunday. The Taylors grew up in an area of Palm Springs known as Section 14; racial segregation made the neighbourhood one of the few places where black people could purchase a home. But that was before the fires. Every week a new home would go up in flames - sometimes with a neighbours' belongings inside. The Taylor family moved from home to home in Section 14, trying to outrun the flames. Each time their house was destroyed. After a lengthy investigation, a 1968 report from the California Department of Justice deemed the destruction of Section 14 a \"city-engineered holocaust.\" Nearly six decades later, survivors of Section 14 could finally see restitution after the California Department of Justice Reparations Task Force issued a sweeping set of reparations proposals last week. The thousand-page report sets out 115 legislative recommendations to address inequalities among black Californians and ensure that injustices - like the destruction of Section 14 - never happen again. Among the recommendations is a controversial proposal for cash payments of at least $1.2m (\u00a3943,400) to each black descendant of slaves. Members of the task force said they hope their report helps the public understand the true cost of racism in California, regardless of whether the government ends up deciding to give direct cash payments or not. The issue is highly divisive in the state. A new poll from the Public Policy Institute of California found that 54% of likely California voters had an unfavourable view of the task force, while nearly the same amount, 59%, believe the state should offer a formal apology for human rights violations and crimes against humanity on African slaves and their descendants. The atmosphere was charged on Thursday, when the report was presented to the public, with some saying payments could not come soon enough. \"It's my money, and I want it now,\" one woman yelled. Others others said it was unfair to ask this generation to pay for the sins of the past through reparations that will ultimately be funded by tax dollars. California Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli, who is Lebanese-American, said he opposes the recommendations of the task force because \"This whole thing of focusing on people's race and victimhood, [and] is nothing but an attempt to divide Americans and pit them against each other,\" he told the BBC. This debate is nothing new. Americans have argued over the idea of reparations since the end of the Civil War. In recent years since, members of Congress have tried - and failed - to establish a commission to study proposals for reparations for African Americans. While reparations efforts might have stalled on the federal level, local discussions have intensified, especially in the years since the murder of George Floyd. Evanston, Illinois became the first city in the US to give financial compensation for racist housing discrimination. But California's plan, if implemented, would be the most sweeping to date. Dr Cheryl Grills, a clinical psychologist who specialises in racial trauma and was appointed to the task force, said it is necessary to acknowledge how the past continues to impact people today. \"Enslavement may have ended, but the ideology and the mechanisms to try to keep black people at the bottom are very much still with us,\" Dr Grills said. It's a lesson the Taylor's say they learned first-hand. They say the destruction of their home in Section 14 formed a core memory that would shape the rest of their lives. Their father, a proud man, refused to abandon the home he built for his family. He tried in vain to secure a loan to buy the land, but at a time when most banks refused to give black Americans mortgages, he was left with few options. He began to drink heavily to cope with the stress; eventually, Pearl said, their mother packed up the children and left Palm Springs and their father behind. \"We weren't there to see the actual day that he was pushed out of the home. I'm sure it was very traumatic for him,\" Pearl said. Mr Taylor ultimately died from alcoholism. As a young man, Alvin Taylor threw himself into music and channelled his prowess at drumming into a career playing alongside famous acts like Little Richard, The Beatle's George Harrison, and Elton John. For a while, success numbed the pain of losing his childhood, his home and his father. But when that stopped working, Mr Taylor said he turned to drugs. \"I was looking for an escape.\" After a years-long battle with addiction, Mr Taylor was sent to prison. Now, at 71, he believes the destruction of his home is the root of his struggle with addiction. \"Looking back, it feels like we were really treated like animals and disregarded as human beings,\" he said. Experiences like the Taylors are part of the reason California assembled the task force. But how do you put a dollar amount on the harms of racism? To calculate the cost, the task force looked at state data on the financial impact of harms in five categories: health, housing discrimination, unjust property takings, devaluation of black businesses, and mass incarceration and over-policing. The task force said this list of harms is not exhaustive, and may be added to at a later date, which could raise the total cost beyond the $1.2m person outlined in the report. Their calculations were meant to be educational estimates - an \"intentionally conservative\" effort underscore that there is a financial cost to racism in America. The challenge of determining just how much restitution would be paid, however, will ultimately fall to California's state lawmakers, who will vote on whether to adopt the recommendations found in the final report. They could decide to issue only a portion of the recommended amount, or compensate people in other ways, such as through loan forgiveness or other social programmes. The state is currently in a budget deficit, and some have speculated that Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, is unlikely to support a multi-billion dollar cash pay-out. Previously, he said: \"Dealing with the legacy of slavery is about much more than cash payments.\" As the child of immigrants, Assemblyman Essayli said he feels it would be unfair to force everyone in the state to pay for reparations. \"My family had nothing to do with slavery. California was never a slave state,\" he said. \"I think racism is just an ugly part of humanity and I just don't understand how we're going to quantify racism for a particular group.\" For Donald Tamaki, an attorney, civil rights advocate and the only non-black member of the task force, the backlash has been frustrating, but predictable. Critics, he said, have \"sticker shock\" because they're not used to framing reparations as a societal obligation. For his part, Mr Tamaki said he equates funding reparations to using tax dollars to fund public schools, even if you don't have children, Mr Tamaki said. But there is a precedent for cash reparations - one Mr Tamaki is personally familiar with. His family was among the more than 120,000 Japanese Americans forced from their homes and into government-run internment camps at the start of World War II. In 1983, Mr Tamaki served on the legal team that helped pave the way for the 1988 Civil Liberties Act, which officially apologised for Japanese internment and paid $20,000 to each surviving former detainee. \"For most Japanese Americans, it was getting their dignity back,\" he said. Years after the City of Palm Springs reduced their family home to rubble, Pearl and Alvin's mom was finally able to purchase a new house -- and the land as well. \"She was so excited telling her sister,\" Ms Taylor Devers recalled. \"She was feeling really confident that this home was not going to be burned from underneath her or taken away.\" That resilience and determination to not only rebuild, but thrive, is the essence of what it means to black in America, Ms Taylor Devers said. But it has come at a steep cost. Speaking onstage at a Juneteenth rally less than a mile away from where her family home once stood, Ms Taylor Devers encouraged her fellow Section 14 survivors to remain vigilant in their fight for justice and reparations. Standing just offstage, Alvin Taylor nodded in agreement. Later that evening, he cautiously picked his way across desert stones and scrub brush to stand on the concrete foundation that had once been his home. After 60 years, the parcel of land remains undeveloped. \"There literally isn't a dollar figure that could compensate for what the harm that was done. We realize that,\" she said. \"But I think that the idea that some type of restitution would be attempted to be made would be very helpful.\"",

        "title": "France riots: Why are police using guns during traffic stops?",
        "content": "The fatal shooting by police of a 17-year-old boy driving a car in a Paris suburb is the latest in a spate of such deadly incidents in France. It was the third killing this year during a police traffic stop and followed a record 13 deaths last year. Most of the victims have been of black or Arab origin, Reuters news agency reports. By law French police are allowed to shoot in five instances following a 2017 change in the law. That includes when the driver or occupants of a vehicle ignore an order to stop and are deemed to pose a risk to the officer's life or physical safety, or other people's. France's human rights ombudsman has opened an inquiry into Tuesday's killing of Nahel M, the sixth such inquiry since the start of last year. The officer involved has been charged with homicide. France is no stranger to unrest in its banlieues - poorer outer suburbs with high levels of unemployment and crime - and police say they are facing increasing levels of violence. In 2016, in a housing estate outside of Paris, an officer suffered serious burns and was put in an induced coma after a group of youths pelted his patrol car with petrol bombs. Police unions protested and demanded a strong response from the government. In response, the then-interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve vowed to change the law on the use of firearms by police, and the passing of Article 435-1 of the penal code followed in March 2017. On Tuesday police shot dead a 17-year-old boy of Algerian descent, named as Nahel M, as he drove away from a traffic stop. According to the Nanterre prosecutor, Nahel was shot after he refused to stop the car he was driving following orders by two policemen, who later said the vehicle committed various traffic violations and endangered pedestrians. On Thursday, Laurent-Franck Lienard said his client discharged his firearm \"in full compliance of the law\". \"He did not act outside the legal framework,\" Mr Lienard said. Last year a study showed that fatal police shootings on drivers of moving vehicles had multiplied fivefold since the law was implemented. Of the 39 people killed by police in 2022, 13 were drivers who were shot on the basis that they failed to comply with orders. They included Rayana, a young woman who was shot dead by police while a passenger in a car when the driver ignored a police order to stop. Critics argue the increase in such incidents is a direct result of Article 435-1, which they say is much too vague because it leaves officers to determine whether the driver's refusal to comply poses a risk. Henri Leclerc, president of French NGO Human Rights League, said the law allowed officers to be \"uninhibited\" with their firearms as it provides them with \"legal protection\" for shooting. Some politicians have also called for the law to be reviewed. Far-left politician Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon has denounced it as a \"right-to-kill\" law. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has rejected the criticism of the firearms law and insisted fewer people had been killed by police since 2017. However, a study by investigative media outlet Basta disputed this, saying that while 27 people were killed by police in 2017, that number grew to 40 in 2020 and increased further to 52 in 2021. Earlier this week Mr Cazeneuve defended the legislation, saying \"it does not at all give officers permission to shoot whenever\". The former interior minister told Le Monde that the legislation should not be blamed for police lack of professionalism or training. Speaking to the BBC, the Unsad-Police trade union's Deputy Secretary General Thierry Clair said an investigation would determine whether the weapon had been used legally. \"The key thing is the principle of proportionality with the nature of the threat,\" Mr Clair said. \"For instance, one of the cases refers to stopping a vehicle whose occupants refuse to comply and present a risk for someone else if they attempt to escape. \"And the incident we're talking about - in which a weapon was used - might fall into that category.\" In 2021 there were 37 deaths during police operations in France, 10 of whom were shot dead, according to the latest report from the police regulator IGPN - a figure that is lower than the number cited by media outlet Basta. That figure puts France at about 0.5 deaths per million people. Countries tend to report these figures differently, so it's difficult to compare. For example, there is a question of whether the death occurred during the operation or after it. But it's definitely considerably lower than the USA, where the figure was about 3.5 per million and Canada where it was about 1.5. And it's higher than England and Wales, where there were two fatal police shootings and 11 deaths in or following police custody in 2021-22. That is about 0.2 deaths per million.

        "title": "Ukraine finds British WW2 Hurricane planes outside Kyiv",
        "content": "The rusting remains of eight British Hurricane fighter planes dating back to World War Two have been found buried in a forest in Ukraine. The aircraft were sent to the Soviet Union by Britain after Nazi Germany invaded the country in 1941. They were part of a package of allied military support for the USSR, paid for by the United States under the so-called Lend-Lease scheme. Similar legislation is being used by the US government today to send military aid to Ukraine as it seeks to expel Russian forces from its country. Aviation experts say this is the first time the remains of so many Hurricanes have been found in Ukraine. \"It is very rare to find this aircraft in Ukraine,\" says Oleks Shtan, a former airline pilot who is leading the excavation. \"It's very important for our aviation history because no Lend-Lease aircraft have been found here before.\" The Hawker Hurricane was the workhorse of the Battle of Britain - the air campaign of 1940 when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defeated German attempts to invade the UK. Although its role has often been overshadowed by the newer and more adaptable Spitfire plane, the Hurricane actually shot down more than half of all enemy aircraft during the battle. \"The Hurricane was a strong, easy to fly machine,\" Mr Shtan says. \"It was stable as a gun platform and suitable for inexperienced pilots. A reliable aircraft.\" In total, about 3,000 Hurricanes were sent to the USSR between 1941 and 1944 to support the Soviet war effort. Most were either destroyed in combat or dismantled later for parts. But some Hurricanes were deliberately broken up and buried after the war so the Soviets did not have to pay back the United States. Under the Lend-Lease legislation, the USSR was required to pay for any donated military equipment that remained intact after hostilities ended. This was the fate of the eight Hurricanes found buried in woodland south of Kyiv - now the capital of independent Ukraine, but until 1991 part of the USSR. They had been stripped of their instruments, radios, machine guns and any useful scrap metal. They were then dragged by tractors from a nearby airfield, broken up and dropped without ceremony into a shallow ravine. It is thought they were then covered with earth by bulldozers. The remains were discovered recently after an unexploded bomb dating from the war was found nearby. The rest of the ravine was checked using metal detectors and the Hurricanes were found. The National Aviation Museum of Ukraine is now in the process of painstakingly excavating the site by hand. Staff there aim to identify as much of the aircraft as possible so they can be reassembled and put on display. Valerii Romanenko, head of research at the museum, says the Hurricanes played an important part in Ukraine's history. \"The Hurricanes are a symbol of British assistance during the years of the Second World War, just as we are very appreciative of British assistance nowadays,\" he says. \"The UK is one of the largest suppliers of military equipment to our country now.\" \"In 1941 Britain was the first who supplied fighter aircraft to the Soviet Union in mass scale. Now the UK is the first country which gives Storm Shadow cruise missiles to our armed forces.\" It is thought there are just 14 restored Hurricanes able to fly in the world today. After the German invasion, the USSR lost many warplanes and was in desperate need of fighter aircraft. Initially several RAF Hurricane squadrons were sent to the Arctic to help. But soon the British pilots left and the aircraft were taken over by Soviet airmen. Records show that many disliked the Hurricane, considering it under-powered, under-armed and under-protected. By the end of the war it was considered obsolete and was used mainly for air defence work. The eight Hurricanes found south of Kyiv were used to defend major transport hubs - especially railway stations and junctions.",

        "title": "Prince Harry, Piers Morgan and hacking: What did the bosses know?",
        "content": "The seven-week trial into allegations of phone hacking by Mirror Group Newspapers journalists has come to an end. Is the evidence against the tabloid stacking up? At times during the hacking court case it seemed as though we had travelled back in time, to the days before social media, when people got their news from pages of ink, printed on actual paper. Back to the 1990s and 2000s, when stories about Prince Harry - barely out of school and falling for his first girlfriends - could fill newspapers day after day. The tabloids were also fascinated by soap stars. Two Coronation Street actors were claimants in this trial. Michael Turner played mechanic Kevin, and Nikki Sanderson, hairdresser Candice. The fourth claimant was Fiona Wightman, dragged into the red-tops by her marriage to Paul Whitehouse, whose TV comedy sketches on The Fast Show had catapulted him to fame in the 90s. What became clear during the trial was Mirror journalists didn't just make up their stories as many critics of the tabloids might believe. They pursued accurate reporting of celebrity secrets as vigorously as another journalist might investigate a corrupt politician. But their most precious commodity was sensitive personal information, some of it obtained illicitly from phone hacking. This is no longer disputed by the newspapers, because this trial was not the first. In 2015, the publisher of the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People (now known as Reach PLC) admitted journalists used phone hacking and other unlawful methods during a previous landmark case, brought by another Coronation Street actor, Shobna Gulati and others. The High Court judge, Mr Justice Mann, ruled that for seven years, from 1999, there had been \"widespread, institutionalised and long-standing\" phone hacking at the newspapers and editors knew - in particular, the editor of the Sunday Mirror, Tina Weaver. The publisher apologised. In the latest trial, which concluded on Friday, the claimants were trying to expand the legal action to more potential victims, and prove the scandal reached the top of Mirror Group - to its board and its lawyers. If Mr Justice Fancourt finds they knew - and did nothing - the company could be hit with massive bills for compensation. During this trial, the claimants attempted to make a new case against Piers Morgan, the television presenter who was Mirror editor between 1995 and 2004, who had emerged largely unscathed from the 2015 trial. They brought together a series of incidents, which they said suggested he knew quite a lot about phone hacking and blagging - the reckless obtaining of personal information such as addresses, phone bills or bank statements - in the hope of creating an unbreakable thread of evidence. There was the lunch where Mr Morgan urged a phone company executive to tell his customers they should change the PIN numbers on their mobiles, because journalists could listen to their voicemail messages. There was the former intern who told the court he overheard a journalist reassuring Mr Morgan that a story about the singer Kylie Minogue was accurate because it had come from her voicemails. A former Guardian journalist who said in a statement that Mr Morgan had explained to him most people didn't change the default access code for their voicemails, so they were easy to guess. And the agent for TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson, who couldn't work out why Mr Morgan seemed to know so much about her client. But neither side called Mr Morgan to the witness box to defend himself. In civil trials, witnesses only tend to be called if they can help one side or the other. The Mirror Group argued Mr Morgan's appearance would have been an \"unnecessary distraction\" from the issues the judge has to decide. Remember, a key question was what executives knew. Piers Morgan was not on the board of Mirror Group Newspapers, the company said, and only attended two meetings over nine years. But towards the end of the hearings, the judge put Mr Morgan at the top of a list of 29 journalists who hadn't come to court and perhaps \"could and should\" have given evidence. After all, Mr Justice Fancourt pointed out, the former editor had been happy to talk about phone hacking outside court. Mr Morgan recently told the BBC: \"I never hacked a phone. I wouldn't even know how. I never told anybody to hack a phone.\" He also insisted he didn't know phone hacking was going on, but also that he couldn't be sure stories hadn't been published which used unlawful methods. But will the judge \"draw an inference\" that Mr Morgan not giving evidence suggests he was involved? He could decide he doesn't have to make any ruling at all about the former editor. So what else did we learn? The trial lifted the lid on a network of private investigators, or PIs, who specialised in feeding personal information to the tabloids. For the first time, a handful appeared in court. Ageing veterans of the information trade, sometimes scoffing at the questions they faced, sometimes confused by them. Between 1996 and 2011 the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People spent at least \u00a39m in payments to PIs. We heard that reporters on the Mirror papers regularly subcontracted the process of obtaining information to these PIs. A reporter might get one to find an address and phone number from credit reference agencies, or from the Electoral Roll, potentially breaching data protection laws. It was claimed journalists might use these details to hack a celebrity's phone themselves, or pass them onto another specialist investigator, who would in turn know the right \"blagger\" able to get more information. There were people who would pose as bank customers to get financial records, or NHS staff to obtain someone's medical status. Some were experts at digging through credit records, others at digging through rubbish. Literally, the contents of celebrity bins. The information would then be passed back up the chain, and presented to the reporter. The claimants argued this would allow the journalist to say it had been provided by \"sources\", and to deny knowing it had potentially been obtained unlawfully. Quotes lifted from phone hacking would be written up as the words of anonymous \"insiders\" to disguise their source, the court heard. Mirror Group's barrister, Andrew Green KC, accepted there were some investigators who broke the law - \"rotters\" as he called them several times. But most of the time they were using legitimate databases, he said. The three alleged victims of \"unlawful information gathering\" were chosen as test cases. Prince Harry picked himself as the fourth by simply refusing to settle with the Mirror. Their time in the witness box was mainly spent defending their cases against Mr Green. He tried to get them to accept that the stories the newspapers published about them must have come from publicly available sources, from friends, \"insiders\", other newspapers or even interviews they had willingly given. He argued the four cases had been \"wildly overstated\" and, in the case of Prince Harry, it was \"entirely speculative\". Unlike the 2015 case, Mr Green added, there was very little evidence phones were hacked or that information was unlawfully obtained. Prince Harry's approach in the witness box was to suppress his anger and suggest it was for the journalists to explain how they got their stories about him. At the time, he didn't read all 33 articles in his case but said \"every single article has caused me distress\" - saying they tainted his relationship with friends he suspected might be leaking information. The stories about him were so accurate he was \"incredibly suspicious\" they had been sourced illegitimately, especially by phone hacking. He was unable to say which voicemails had been accessed. It was all a very long time ago. The emotional damage done by tabloid reporting became clear when Fiona Wightman entered the witness box. In 2000, her split from comedian Paul Whitehouse and her cancer diagnosis were both of interest to the Mirror newspapers, which, it is alleged, tried to use a \"blagger\" to check her medical condition. Sometimes in tears, she told the court: \"I've had to discuss some of the most personal things I have had to go through. The most difficult times in my life.\" Being involved in the case meant, she said, that \"ironically it can now be reported. At the time I chose not to discuss any of it.\" Don't expect a quick decision about these cases. It may be months before Mr Justice Fancourt gives a judgement and more than 100 potential claimants are waiting on his words. It is now more than a decade since well-known people began to take on the newspapers they say have tormented their lives. Hundreds of victims have received damages in legal settlements and only MGN has been prepared to let the battle extend to a public trial. But the case of Sussex v MGN is not going to be the last trial. Next year, actor Hugh Grant will take on the publisher of the Sun newspaper. Prince Harry may join him. Round two for the Duke. And an even more aggressive legal battle is on the horizon. Associated Newspapers, whose top selling title is the Daily Mail, is gearing up to fight off new allegations made by Elton John, Doreen Lawrence - mother of murdered Stephen - and, of course, Prince Harry. They include the use of phone-tapping and bugs. The publisher has denied any involvement in what have become known as \"the dark arts\".",

        "content": "Attackers in France tried to set fire to the home of a suburban Paris mayor's home overnight and fired rockets at the official's fleeing wife and children. The incident has caused widespread shock and is being treated as attempted murder. Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne described it as intolerable. Mayor Vincent Jeanbrun was not at home, but his wife suffered a broken leg and a child was also hurt. France has seen violent protests after police killed a teenager on Tuesday. The suspects in the incident in L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses, south of Paris, have not been identified. Mr Jeanbrun said he had been in his office overseeing the situation when the attack on his home occurred at 01:30 (23:30 GMT on Saturday). The attackers used a car to ram through the gates of their home before setting the vehicle on fire so that the blaze would spread to the house, the mayor said in a statement. Then when his wife, Melanie Nowak, tried to flee with the children, aged five and seven, they were attacked with firework rockets. Mayor Jeanbrun called it \"a murder attempt of unspeakable cowardice\". \"A line has been crossed,\" he said. \"If my priority today is to take care of my family, my determination to protect and serve the Republic is greater than before,\" he added. The mayor, from the centre-right Les Republicains, has received widespread support from across the French political spectrum. The public prosecutor's office has started an investigation for attempted murder. The attack on Mayor Jeanbrun's home came during the fifth night of violent protests across France over the death of Nahel M, 17, who was shot by police at point-blank range during a traffic stop. Around 45,000 police were deployed in France on Saturday to control the protests and the interior ministry said Saturday night had been quieter, with fewer arrests overall. However there were more than 700 arrests across the country and more than 800 fires were lit by rioters during the course of the night, officials said. Mr Jeanbrun had urged the French government earlier to impose a state of emergency in response to the riots, which President Emmanuel Macron has so far declined to do. The French leader is due to meet with top officials later to discuss the crisis.",

        "title": "Orkney council to look at proposals to become territory of Norway",
        "content": "The Orkney Islands could change their status in the UK or even become a self-governing territory of Norway under new proposals. A motion will go before the council next week to investigate \"alternative forms of governance\". Council leader James Stockan said Orkney does not get fair funding with its current relationship within the UK. He wants to look at Crown Dependencies like the Channel Islands and overseas territories like the Falkland Islands. He suggested another possible future could be like the Faroe Islands - which is a self-governing territory of Denmark. Councillor Stockan told BBC Radio Scotland there were many areas where Orkney was being \"failed dreadfully\" by both the UK and Scottish governments. He said: \"We are really struggling at the moment, we have to replace the whole ferry fleet which is older than the CalMac fleet. \"We are denied the things that other areas get like RET (Road Equivalent Tariff) for ferry fares. \"And the funding we get from the Scottish government is significantly less per head than Shetland and the Western Isles to run the same services - we can't go on as we are.\" Mr Stockan said an in-depth study of the finances had never been carried out. \"We know that we have contributed for the last 40 years through north sea oil, and the dividend we get back isn't sufficient to keep us going,\" he said. \"We've got a unique opportunity right at the heart of all the wind projects round our waters.\" Mr Stockan is urging councillors to back his idea to find new ways for Orkney to get greater financial security and economic opportunities for Orcadians. Orkney Islands Council previously voted in 2017 to look at whether the islands could have greater autonomy. While they wanted to have a \"stronger voice\", they did not back full independence for Orkney. Mr Stockan's motion also cites British Crown Dependencies Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man as potential models to follow. But he warns that a large amount of staff resource would be needed to investigate the options and consult the public. \"The council will decide whether it supports this motion and from there we will take our time, because we don't want to do this emotionally,\" he said. \"We want to look at all the practical implications and then we'll evaluate the results. \"We are looking for the very best position for future generations and our place in the world. Mr Stockan also suggests that the council should investigate how Orkney could secure a \"Nordic connection\" with Denmark. Norway or Iceland. Orkney was previously held under Norwegian and Danish control until it became part of Scotland in 1472. The islands were used as security for the wedding dowry of Margaret of Denmark, the future wife of King James III of Scotland. Mr Stockan said: \"We were part of the Norse kingdom for much longer than we were part of the United Kingdom. \"On the street in Orkney people come up and say to me when are we going to pay back the dowry, when are we going back to Norway, \"There is a hug affinity and a huge deep cultural relationship there. This is exactly the moment to explore what is possible.\" The UK government said it was providing \u00a32.2bn to level up UK communities, including \u00a350m to grow the economies of Scotland's Islands - including Orkney. A spokesperson said: \"We will always be stronger together as one United Kingdom, and we have no plans to change the devolution settlement.\" The Scottish government said in 2023-24 Orkney Islands Council would receive \u00a389.7m to fund services, with an extra \u00a34.6m from an increase in council tax by 10%. A Scottish government spokesperson said it was \"committed to supporting island communities\". The motion will be discussed by Orkney Islands Council on Tuesday.

        "content": "A Philippines advertising agency has apologised for using footage of other countries in a promotional tourism video. The campaign used images of rice terraces in Indonesia, sand dunes in the United Arab Emirates and an aircraft landing in Switzerland. The agency, DDB Philippines, apologised for the \"unfortunate oversight\". Philippine's tourism secretary, Christina Garcia Frasco, said no public funds had been used to make the video. Ms Frasco said the Department of Tourism had repeatedly sought confirmation from the advertising agency, DDB Philippines, that the materials used in the video were their own and were original. She said on \"ALL these occasions, DDB repeatedly assured the DOT that the originality and ownership of all materials are in order\". It was made as a part of a \u00a3708,298 (US 900,000) \"Love the Philippines\" campaign, which was launched in late June. The use of the videos from other countries was first uncovered by analysis by French news agency AFP and Philippine blogger Sass Rogando Sasot. Ms Frasco said the department would ensure DDB Philippines took accountability for the video. DDB Philippines said in its own statement that the use of stock footage in mood videos is standard in the advertising industry, but apologised for using other videos in this instance. \"The use of foreign stock footage in a campaign promoting the Philippines in highly inappropriate, and contradictory to the DOT's objectives\", it said. The video has been removed and the company said it would assist the department of tourism with its investigation.",

        "title": "Shell still trading Russian gas despite pledge to stop",
        "content": "Shell is still trading Russian gas more than a year after pledging to withdraw from the Russian energy market. The company was involved in nearly an eighth of Russia's shipborne gas exports in 2022, according to analysis from campaign group Global Witness. Oleg Ustenko, an adviser to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, accused Shell of accepting \"blood money\". Shell said the trades were the result of \"long-term contractual commitments\" and do not violate laws or sanctions. As recently as 9 May, a vast tanker capable of carrying more than 160,000 cubic metres of gas compressed into liquid form - liquefied natural gas or LNG - pulled out of the port of Sabetta, on the Yamal peninsula in Russia's far north. That cargo was purchased by Shell before heading onwards to its ultimate destination, Hong Kong. It is one of eight LNG cargoes that Shell has bought from Yamal this year, according to data from the Kpler database analysed by Global Witness. Last year Shell accounted for 12% of Russia's seaborne LNG trade, Global Witness calculates, and was among the top five traders of Russian-originated LNG that year. In March 2022, in the weeks following the invasion of Ukraine, Shell apologised for buying a cargo of Russian oil, and said it intended to withdraw from Russian oil and gas. It said that it would stop buying Russian oil, sell its service stations and other businesses in Russia,which it has done. It has also ended its joint ventures with the state energy giant Gazprom. And it said it would start a \"phased withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and LNG\". But it warned that it would be a \"complex challenge\". Since then, it has kept taking cargoes of LNG from two Russian ports, the one at Yamal and one at Sakhalin in the far east. Shell used to be a minority investor in the Sakhalin gas project, but abandoned that claim in September last year after the Russian government transferred its shares to a local business - and since then has taken no gas from Sakhalin. But it still honours the contract with the Russian LNG company Novatek, which obliges it to buy 900,000 tonnes a year from Yamal until the 2030s, according to the Reuters news agency. Novatek is Russia's second biggest gas company, and the taxes it pays are a significant contributor to the Russian government's budget. Oleg Ustenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said: \"It is quite simple: by continuing to trade in Russian gas Shell is putting money into Putin's pockets and helping to fund Russia's brutal aggression against the people of Ukraine. \"The vast sums that Shell and the whole oil industry have made in Russia should be used to help fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, rather than lining the pockets of their shareholders.\" A spokesman for Shell said: \"Shell has stopped buying Russian LNG on the spot market, but still has some long-term contractual commitments. This is in full compliance with sanctions, applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate. \"There is a dilemma between putting pressure on the Russian government over its atrocities in Ukraine and ensuring stable, secure energy supplies. It is for governments to decide on the incredibly difficult trade-offs that must be made.\" Shell is the world's largest trader of LNG, which is not subject to European sanctions, making billions of dollars in profits trading oil and gas last year. Russia massively reduced its deliveries of gas by pipeline last year, but it has increased the amount of gas it supplies by ship, including to Europe. The UK has not imported any Russian gas for over a year, while EU politicians are trying to reduce the amount of Russian LNG the bloc imports. In March, the EU's Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson called on countries and firms to stop buying Russian gas, and not to sign new contracts. \"It's long overdue that the trading of Russian LNG is looked at with the same disgust as Russian oil trading. Targeting Putin's energy income cannot be about symbolic measures but must concretely put a stop to the huge fossil fuel sums that cement his power,\" said Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner at Global Witness. The France-based energy company TotalEnergies is a minority shareholder in the Yamal project, and was also a major trader in Russian LNG, the Global Witness analysis reported. The BBC has approached TotalEnergies for comment.",

        "title": "France teen's family tell BBC police use of lethal force must change",
        "content": "A relative of the French teenager shot by police has told the BBC the family did not want his death to spark riots, but insisted the law around lethal force at traffic stops must change. Nahel M was shot point-blank by police after failing to stop for a traffic check last Tuesday. \"We never called for hate or riots,\" the relative said. France has seen five days of violent rioting. Speaking to the BBC near the family home in Nanterre, the relative said the rioting - which has seen thousands arrested, shops looted and hundreds of vehicles set alight across France - did not honour Nahel's memory. \"We didn't ask to break or steal. All of this is not for Nahel,\" they told the BBC, speaking on condition of anonymity because tensions are so high following Nahel's shooting. They said they had called for a \"White March in the street. Walking in memory of Nahel. Walking, even being angry in the street, demonstrating, but without outbursts\". The relative said French authorities must now change the law that allows police officers to shoot during traffic stops. Nahel's relative called for \"better training for the French police, weapons regulation for police, and reviewing the law that allows police to use lethal force if a young person refuses to stop at a traffic stop\". France's penal code was changed in 2017 to allow for a broader use of firearms after police said they were facing increased levels of violence. Critics argue the increase in traffic related shootings is a direct result of that change, which they say is much too vague because it leaves officers to determine whether the driver's refusal to comply poses a risk. So far this year, three people have been killed during police traffic stops - following a record 13 people killed in traffic stop incidents last year. According to Reuters news agency most of those victims have been of black or Arab origin. Anais, a family friend and neighbour also told the BBC that being a young black man in France's suburbs meant being subject to racism, violence and racial profiling on a daily basis. \"They [the police] humiliate, insult and don't speak properly to them. And now they kill them! Nahel was covered by the press, but it's not the first time this has happened,\" she said. Nahel's relative said as a result of the ongoing chaos, the family had not had a moment to sit down together and remember him. \"We want everything to calm down. Social media, riots, everything needs to calm down. With all of this, we haven't had time to sit down for five minutes together and think about how he's gone now,\" they said. Earlier on Sunday, Nahel's grandmother also called for an end to the violence and accused rioters of using Nahel's death as an excuse. \"Don't destroy the schools, don't destroy the buses. It is other mothers who take these buses,\" Nadia, Nahel's grandmother, told BFMTV.",

        "title": "Inside Biden Administration\u2019s Semiconductor Training Programs",
        "content": "On June 9, President Joe Biden and the First Lady made a rare visit to the small town of Rocky Mount, N.C., a diverse enclave in a battleground state that his team believes he can win in 2024. It was the town\u2019s first visit from a sitting president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, drawing hundreds of residents to line the streets and wave as the presidential motorcade made its way through town. For Biden, the stop in Rocky Mount was aimed at persuading voters that his policies are bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. after decades of offshoring, as well as creating new, well-paying jobs that don\u2019t require a college degree. He was there to visit the Nash County Community College, which holds a new 96-hour course supported by government funds designed to help students pursue a career in manufacturing without a traditional four-year degree. \u201cLook, you can\u2019t have advanced manufacturing without a highly trained workforce. They don\u2019t go together,\u201d Biden told the assembled students. \u201cThat\u2019s where you all come in.\u201d But as the President travels the country to tout his economic vision, industry experts have warned that manufacturers may run into trouble hiring enough workers. According to a report from Deloitte, the U.S. semiconductor industry could face a shortage of about 70,000 to 90,000 workers over the next few years, in part because skilled workers and those with advanced technical degrees are choosing to work at big technology firms instead of manufacturing facilities. McKinsey has also projected a shortage of 90,000 skilled technicians in the U.S. by 2030. The Commerce Department is aware of the looming issue: \u201cWe really have to just get a lot more serious about it, and also develop new pipelines,\u201d Secretary Gina Raimondo said at a summit on April 18. \u201cThe forecasts are that we\u2019ll be about 100,000 semiconductor technicians short in the next handful of years, if we don\u2019t do something differently. That\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d When asked if the Administration is worried that there won\u2019t be enough workers to fill all the jobs created by the CHIPS and Science Act, a senior Commerce Department official responded: \u201cLook, it\u2019s a challenge and our job here is to address the challenge.\u201d Biden may also have misled prospective applicants on salary expectations. In his most recent State of the Union address, he said the CHIPS Act has created jobs that pay an average of $130,000 a year, many of which do not require a college degree. But company representatives from Intel, the company responsible for many of the workforce training programs launched so far, note that the $130,000 figure that Biden officials have touted is an average amount that could be skewed by management and employees with advanced degrees. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that every job is going to pay six figures,\u201d a separate senior Biden Administration official says. \u201cThat\u2019s the average. When you aggregate all the jobs\u2014the four-year degree jobs, the two years, the training certificates\u2014you will get a number like $135,000\u2026 But of course it\u2019s a mix of jobs.\u201d Still, having more jobs than workers\u2014and a plan to address the shortfall\u2014isn\u2019t a bad place to be politically, and the Biden Administration is hopeful that it can blunt a possible workforce shortage and bring crucial manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. to compete with China. Across the country, community colleges, universities, and school districts have been creating or expanding training programs to attract more students to the semiconductor industry, which experts say is on the cusp of a manufacturing boom. To receive a slice of the federal subsidies under the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Department is requiring companies to submit applications that include detailed plans about how they will recruit and retain workers, prompting a new wave of workforce training programs. \u201cWorkforce development is a core part of our application and evaluation process,\u201d the senior Commerce Department official says. \u201cIt\u2019s really important on a regional and local basis to build the workforce necessary to fill these jobs. Partnerships with university systems, community colleges, workforce and labor organizations\u2014these are all the types of things that we are expecting our applicants to see.\u201d In Maricopa County, Ariz., outside Phoenix, three community colleges have partnered with Intel to offer a \u201cQuick Start\u201d program aimed at preparing students to become entry-level technicians at Intel, its suppliers, or other semiconductor manufacturers in just 10 days, funded by a grant from the Arizona Commerce Authority and at no cost to the students if they complete the course. Students who graduated from the boot camp told TIME that they were taught the basics of how chips are made, practiced using various hand tools, and tried on the head-to-toe gowns (called \u201cbunny suits\u201d) that technicians wear to prevent stray lint or hair from damaging the wafers. Even a speck of dust can ruin the chip-making process. Lisa Strothers, a 35-year-old from Phoenix, Ariz., had just been laid off from her job as a loan support specialist when she received an email about the program. \u201cBegin your exciting new career with only 10 days of training,\u201d the message read. It was a path she had never considered, given her non-technical background, but she decided to give it a try. \u201cIt was a lot of information in a short period of time, but they tried to make it very basic so you can still understand,\u201d Strothers says. \u201cOnly one or two people had some type of technology background in our class; the rest of us did not.\u201d Just a few weeks after completing the 10-day program and passing a certification exam, she applied for a job at Intel and was hired as a process technician, responsible for helping troubleshoot equipment and tools. Intel says that demand for the Quick Start program is so high that it had to put hundreds of people on a waiting list just to enroll in the program at its two locations in Phoenix and Portland, Ore. In February, Intel launched a similar \u201crapid\u201d certification program in Ohio, where the company is breaking ground on its planned $20 billion semiconductor facilities set to open in 2025 and employ 3,000 people and require 7,000 construction workers to build. The Ohio program currently has 260 registered students. \u201cThe question of how we scale and how we serve that level of interest is one in our minds right now,\u201d says Gabriela Cruz Thompson, Intel\u2019s director of University Research Collaboration. \u201cQuick Start is still in pilot program mode. We don\u2019t want to over scale and then under serve the students. We want to hear a little bit more from the community in terms of what skills people are getting and make the appropriate adjustments as we might scale this into the future.\u201d So far, the training program has served more than 600 students in Arizona since it began in July 2022. Patty Mfoloe, a graduate of the Portland program after she was laid off from her job in the healthcare sector, said the 10-day bootcamp was challenging at first, but it allowed her to learn more about the chips that run nearly every piece of technology we use. \u201cIt was one of the things that I\u2019ve never done in my life,\u201d says Mfoloe, who now works for Intel as a manufacturing technician in which she\u2019s responsible for the tools that create chips. The average annual income of program graduates upon job placement is $43,000, according to Fresh Start, a Phoenix-based nonprofit women\u2019s foundation that partnered on the initiative with Intel and Mesa Community College. In Oregon, an advertisement for the workforce training program claimed entry level semiconductor technicians earn between $18 and $24 per hour, which translates to an annual salary range of roughly $37,000 to $50,000. Intel claims the training program is just a starting point for a career in the semiconductor manufacturing industry that the Biden Administration is hoping will be better equipped to compete with China and Taiwan, which have dominated the chips race for several decades. Semiconductors were invented in the U.S., but many manufacturers moved their facilities overseas in search of cheaper labor costs and incentives from foreign governments, dragging the U.S. share of chip production down to about 12% today from 37% in the 1990s. To attract chipmakers back to the U.S., Biden signed into law last summer the CHIPS and Science Act, which centers on $52 billion in subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. It has already sparked an outpouring of new private investments in chip plants around the nation, most of which are outside big cities and seek to catalyze economic growth in parts of the country that could use a spark. The challenge now is getting enough people to fill the jobs at those manufacturing plants. Training workers for free in just 10 days could be the key. \u201cI feel like the program is giving people a foot in the door that otherwise wouldn\u2019t even think about doing it,\u201d Strothers says. \u201cIncluding myself.\u201d",

        "title": "The History Behind the Barbie Movie",
        "content": "Barbie is an icon, perhaps the best known toy in the world. As Margot Robbie points out in an interview with me for a TIME cover story, the word \u201cBarbie\u201d has the sort of enviable global recognition only achieved by brands like Coca-Cola. Since her debut in 1959, she has been a staple of the culture, a touchpoint for pop icons like Nicki Minaj, and has become synonymous with a specific shade of pink. And yet it has somehow taken until 2023 for Barbie to make her live-action film debut. On July 21, the doll will finally grace the big screen. While there have been a number of animated Barbie movies and series on Nickelodeon and streaming services, Barbie will be the first live-action movie starring the doll to premiere in theaters. Margot Robbie will play a version of Barbie, but so will Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, and a number of other actors. Ryan Gosling will play just one of many Kens. Every image from the film, beginning with paparazzi shots of Robbie and Gosling rollerskating in spandex, has been dissected online, and Barbiecore has never been hotter. Read More: How Barbie Came to Life It\u2019s officially the summer of Barbie. But the journey here was complicated. In the eight years I have spent reporting on Mattel, other potential Barbie movies have come and gone. The toy company and filmmakers struggled with how to deal with Barbie\u2019s baggage: The traditionally thin-waisted, blonde-haired doll has long been criticized for setting unrealistic body standards. Even after Mattel introduced a Curvy Barbie in 2016 (a major change I documented in a TIME cover story), the original Barbie has stuck in people\u2019s minds. Plus, Barbie is intentionally a blank slate upon which girls can project their dreams and desires. That makes conjuring one specific story for the movie particularly difficult. \u201cAs simple as an 11-and-a-half-inch doll looks, Barbie is a complicated brand,\u201d says President and COO of Mattel Richard Dickson. But when Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz took over the company in 2018, he decided it was time to commit to a Barbie movie. The film would be the first entry in a burgeoning cinematic universe based on the company\u2019s toys. In 2018, Robbie signed on to star and produce Barbie, and Warner Bros. announced that Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach had joined as screenwriters a year later. Here\u2019s the history of how Barbie made it to the big screen\u2014and why it took so long for her to get here. Mattel has been incredibly cautious when it comes to its most valuable asset\u2014and rightly so. Barbie has spent much of her history as the bestselling doll in the world. Barbie devotees would tell you that she inspires little girls to imagine themselves in any profession\u2014astronaut, president, veterinarian. But the doll\u2014and its creators\u2014have also been called out by parents concerned over how she affects their children\u2019s self-esteem. Over the years songs like Aqua\u2019s \u201cBarbie Girl\u201d and even throwaway lines in movies like Legally Blonde\u2014when a Harvard Law student disdainfully calls Elle Woods \u201cMalibu Barbie\u201d\u2014have not exactly bolstered Barbie\u2019s reputation as a figure of female empowerment. Any portrayal of Barbie onscreen would be inherently fraught, and the company hasn\u2019t always had a sense of humor about its iconic doll. When Barbie appeared as a supporting character in Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 4 in the 2010s, Mattel creatives emphasized to me that it was a big a deal the company ceded any control to Pixar and allowed the studio to poke fun at Barbie and Ken. Years earlier, Mattel sued Aqua over \u201cBarbie Girl.\u201d Cut to 2023, and one of the most eagerly anticipated songs on the Barbie soundtrack is Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice\u2019s \u201cBarbie World,\u201d which samples Aqua. When Amy Schumer signed on to play the doll in a live-action movie in 2016, the comedian had cemented herself as a sharp feminist voice in pop culture. Her Comedy Central sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, took no mercy when it came to skewering the patriarchy. She regularly poked fun at blustering men who didn\u2019t find her \u201chot enough\u201d and companies that exploited women in order to sell them products. It was difficult to imagine Mattel, a company that had spent millions maintaining an immaculate image for its doll, would submit to Schumer\u2019s particular brand of humor. Mattel wanted Barbie to inspire. Any comedic take would inevitably take the doll down a peg. Schumer recently said she left the movie because that version wasn\u2019t \u201cfeminist and cool,\u201d as she assumes Gerwig\u2019s version will be. COO and President of Mattel Richard Dickson, who has been with the company long enough to see several potential movies come and go, argues that until Gerwig, the company \u201cnever found the right storyteller\u201d for Barbie. Mattel is now eager to prove it is in on the joke. In Gerwig\u2019s film, the company is run by executives who take umbrage at anyone who points out it\u2019s strange that so many men in suits are running a brand for little girls. And the movie acknowledges Barbie\u2019s complicated impact on girls\u2019 body image in exchanges with modern women we won\u2019t spoil here. Rae, who plays President Barbie in the new movie, points out that calling someone Barbie \u201cdoes have a negative connotation,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018Oh that person might be a bimbo. That person might be dumb. That person is superficial.\u2019 This movie presents an opportunity not to change that, but add more onto it and clear her name in a pretty cool way.\u201d Read More: How Greta Gerwig Got Barbie\u2014From the Clothes to the Dream House\u2014Just Right Gerwig also seems to have a love for the doll that transcends that of the typical filmmaker. During interviews for the story, she delighted in telling me about playing with the dolls as a child for \u201cway too long\u201d\u2014a giddiness that seemed to manifest in the world-building she did with Barbie. \u201cOne of the most endearing things parts of the process with Greta was her appreciation of the brand\u2019s history,\u201d says Dickson. \u201cIt was a matter of finding the right talent that can appreciate the brand\u2019s authenticity and bring that controversy to life in a way that, yes, pokes fun at us but ultimately is purposeful and has heart.\u201d But even signing onto Gerwig\u2019s version took some effort on the part of Mattel. Robbie Brenner, the first executive producer of Mattel Films, told executives they would have to \u201cwhite knuckle it\u201d through the creative process with Gerwig and Baumbach, and learn that a dose of self-depreciation can go a long way.  The question of who, exactly, would play Barbie was paramount. Mattel recently took great pains to modernize its doll. Nearly a decade ago, in 2014, Barbie had a very bad year: The Elsa doll from Frozen dethroned Barbie as the most popular toy for girls, and Lego surpassed Mattel as the biggest toy company. Sinking sales forced Mattel to rethink the brand, manifesting in the introduction of new skin tones and hair types in 2015 and new body shapes in 2016. Read More: Barbie\u2019s Got a New Body One of the reasons Mattel resisted putting Barbie on the big screen for so long was that they had worked to establish that Barbie wasn\u2019t just a skinny beach-bound blonde. There are, in fact, 175 different Barbies with different hair, skin tones, body shapes, and abilities. If Amy Schumer or Anne Hathaway (who was once also attached to play the doll) stood in for Barbie, an otherwise blank canvas would forever be connected to a single actor. If it worked, profits would grow. If it didn\u2019t, decades of Mattel\u2019s hard work would be undone. The idea that many Barbies would populate Gerwig\u2019s movie arose early in the creative process. In fact, it\u2019s what intrigued Robbie as a producer: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should say, \u2018This is the one version of what Barbie is, and that\u2019s what women should aspire to be and look like and act like.'\u201d A Barbie movie probably never would have come to fruition if it weren\u2019t for Mattel CEO Kreiz. In 2018, Kreiz took over the position at a moment of vulnerability for the company. He was the fourth CEO in just four years. He articulated a vision for Mattel that was rooted in intellectual property management. That plan included more streaming shows, games, a theme park currently under construction in Arizona, and movies. Lots of movies. An entire universe of movies. \u201cOnce you think of all those people who buy your product not just as consumers but as fans, you realize you have an audience and all these other opportunities become obvious,\u201d says Kreiz. Marvel and DC have found tremendous success making dozens of films based on stories that already had a built-in fanbase of comics readers. And it just so happens that film audiences seem to be tiring of superheroes. (Look no further than recent box office underperformers like The Flash and Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania.) Studios are now in search of other known IP that has not yet been adapted into film. Recent successes like Super Mario Bros. and Dungeons & Dragons suggest that audiences, too, are ready for something new, if still a bit familiar. Kreiz believed Mattel was sitting on a gold mine of well-known brands\u2014Barbie, Hot Wheels, American Girl, even the Magic 8 Ball. So he created Mattel Films, a studio inside the company, and hired Oscar-nominated producer Brenner to run the show. Mattel has since announced 15 movies, including a Rock \u2018Em Sock \u2018Em film with Vin Diesel, a Hot Wheels movie produced by J.J. Abrams, and even a Barney reboot with Daniel Kaluuya. But Kreiz determined that Mattel\u2019s first cinematic outing should focus on the company\u2019s crown jewel: Barbie. Just four weeks into his tenure as CEO, he requested a meeting with Margot Robbie, who he thought would be a perfect ambassador for the brand. Read More: Meet the Man Who\u2019s Making Barbie a Hollywood Star  It turned out that Robbie was as eager to meet with Mattel as the company was to court her. She thought Barbie would make sense for her production company LuckyChap. \u201cWe were kind of keeping tabs on the property for awhile before there was an opening, and then we could jump in and say, \u2018We\u2019d like to produce this. Here\u2019s how we would do it and who we would want to do it with,'\u201d she says, \u201ci.e someone like Greta\u2014Greta being the top of the list, pie in the sky, dream person.\u201d And then there was the creation of this Barbie, a process that wound up taking five years. The biggest challenge was dreaming up the right story. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a set narrative. I\u2019ve played characters where there\u2019s source material, comic books or if it\u2019s a real person, archival footage,\u201d says Robbie. \u201cEven with fictional characters, there\u2019s a story you end up rooting it in.\u201d Barbie, by contrast, has no personality by design. The idea is for little kids to project jobs and stories onto a blank canvas. So Gerwig and Baumbach had to build not just a character, but a story, and an entire world from scratch. Read More: How Greta Gerwig Is Leading By Example \u201cBefore Greta, we did hear many pitches,\u201d says Brenner. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call them generic because that wouldn\u2019t be fair. They were all interesting in their own right. But it was sort of predictable. You\u2019re thinking, \u2018That\u2019s not enough. We needed to live up to the legacy and the complexity.'\u201d What Gerwig has conjured up is certainly complex. She has fulfilled the presumed corporate mandate: Make a fun summer romp. But the film is stuffed with Gerwig\u2019s idiosyncrasies, from dance numbers inspired by Old Hollywood to Gerwig\u2019s personal preoccupation with stories about complicated mother-daughter relationships. Whether fans flock to Barbie will likely determine the fate of Mattel\u2019s future film endeavors. Kreiz hopes the movie will make a splash and put Mattel Films on the map: \u201cWe\u2019re looking to create movies that become cultural events.\u201d Correction, June 29 The original version of this story misstated the status of Mattel\u2019s upcoming film slate. They have 15 movies announced, not greenlit.",

        "title": "Why You Shouldn't Walk Around Barefoot",
        "content": "Apologies to the dudes who packed away their Allbirds and Crocs in order to parade around town with nothing but sweet air between their feet and the ground. \u201cBarefoot boy summer\u201d has been canceled. That\u2019s according to podiatrists alarmed at recent reports that people (men in particular) are losing their shoes and hitting the streets\u2014heading to coffee shops, hiking trails, airports, and anywhere else their hearts and soles might lead them. Social-media users on platforms like TikTok are sharing videos of themselves (and others) barefoot in the wild. (\u201cBe that primal, hard-to-kill man you know you are, and start walking barefoot outside,\u201d one urges.) The trend is even infiltrating popular media: In a recent episode of Succession, Lukas Matsson (played by Alexander Skarsgard) walks barefoot on the tarmac before boarding his private plane. \u201cI cringed,\u201d says Dr. Priya Parthasarathy, a podiatrist with Foot and Ankle Specialists of Mid-Atlantic in Silver Spring, Md., describing her reaction when she learned going barefoot was in vogue. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty much asking for trouble, and I 100% do not recommend it for a lot of different reasons.\u201d Research suggests that humans began wearing sandals or moccasins more than 40,000 years ago\u2014and there\u2019s a good reason for that. Footwear provides important structural support, comfort, and protection from a wide variety of threats, including sharp objects on the ground, pests, heat, and invisible germs. This seems obvious. So what\u2019s the appeal of ditching shoes? \u201cFor me, and for most people, it\u2019s getting more in touch with our feet as the foundation of our bodies,\u201d says Eric Cohen, 60, who lives in Sag Harbor, N.Y. He\u2019s been going barefoot in certain situations, like on the beach and while exercising, since the barefoot running boom about 15 years ago\u2014which surely qualifies him as one of the original barefoot boys. \u201cThis is what connects us to the ground. Everything starts from the bottom and works up.\u201d He\u2019s not worried about potential harms, and says the rewards outweigh the occasional splinter. The movement isn\u2019t coming out of nowhere: \u201cGrounding,\u201d an alternative medicine practice that involves putting your feet in direct contact with the earth, has been linked to benefits like stress relief and better sleep. And walking barefoot on carpeted floors can increase circulation and strengthen the muscles in the feet, says Dr. Miguel Cunha, a podiatrist who owns Gotham Footcare in New York. But he doesn\u2019t recommend going shoeless at the gym, communal bathing facilities, or outdoors, especially for prolonged periods of time. Experts speculate that people are trotting down city streets sans shoes more in an effort to look cool or edgy, and to show off on social media, than to reap any real health benefits. They advise caution to those intrigued by the trend. One of the biggest concerns is stepping on something painful or dangerous, says Dr. Jane Pontious, a clinical professor in the department of podiatric surgery at the Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine. When she first heard about the barefoot renaissance, she smiled, because it reminded her of childhood days spent near a lake, enjoying freedom of the feet and spirit. \u201cWith that said, did I have problems? Yeah, I did,\u201d she says. \u201cI had splinters several times. I had glass in my foot. I had a fishhook in my foot. Even being healthy and young, it wasn\u2019t the safest thing to do.\u201d Throughout her career, Pontious has removed many things from people\u2019s feet: wood splinters, glass, sewing needles, pieces of shells from the beach, even chihuahua hair (which is \u201cvery strong, like a tough fishing string,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s sharp.\u201d) She worries about hypodermic needles on city streets, stinging pests in the grass, and rocks and sticks on trails. If you step on something dangerous while barefoot, see a doctor right away, she urges. There are also less obvious threats lurking beneath your feet: You can\u2019t see them, but bacteria, fungi, and viruses are common in showers, locker rooms, pools, and anywhere else with a lot of water or moisture. (That\u2019s why experts suggest always wearing shoes before and after you get in the pool, even though it\u2019s a nuisance, and shower shoes if you\u2019re in a dorm or gym.) These microorganisms can lead to infections that change your foot\u2019s appearance and smell. If you have any small breaks in your skin, you\u2019re at an increased risk of developing an infection. \u201cWhen you go out in public outdoors, you\u2019re walking on surfaces that hundreds of people have walked on,\u201d Parthasarathy says. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re coming into contact with.\u201d Most people will detect signs that something is wrong within a few days. If you have athlete\u2019s foot, for example\u2014a fungal skin infection that affects the skin on the feet, including between the toes\u2014you might notice dry, scaly, or cracked skin; inflammation that\u2019s red, purple, or gray; blisters; or itchiness. It sometimes evolves into nail fungus, which causes toenails to become discolored, cracked, or even separated from the nail bed. Or you might develop plantar warts, small growths caused by the human papillomavirus. In that case, \u201cyou would look for calluses with black dots that aren\u2019t going away,\u201d Parthasarathy says. \u201cThey could be painful\u201d and are often difficult to treat. Going barefoot also presents a heightened risk of injury. Every year, people who mow their lawn barefoot run over their feet while cutting the grass, one of the \u201cmost devastating\u201d injuries podiatrists see, Parthasarathy says. Another risk\u2014falling down\u2014might be less dramatic, but it\u2019s still unpleasant, and shoes provide important traction and protection from slippery areas. That\u2019s especially true if you\u2019re considering going barefoot hiking, an idea that experts universally pan. Pontious has treated people who twisted their ankle or suffered a ligament sprain from walking barefoot on uneven surfaces. Plus, going shoeless for an extended amount of time can alter the biomechanics of your feet for the worse, Cunha says. Over the long run, this could accelerate the formation of bunions and hammertoes, or lead to conditions such as plantar fasciitis, shin splints, and Achilles tendonitis. \u201cThe main issue with walking barefoot is that you put a tremendous amount of stress on the foot, allowing it to collapse,\u201d he says. Another summertime hazard: sunburn. Our feet aren\u2019t used to being exposed to the outdoors, and we often forget to put sunscreen on the tops and bottoms, Parthasarathy says. Walking across hot concrete can lead to burns that are difficult to heal\u2014a particular danger for people with diabetes, who might have neuropathy, which means they won\u2019t feel their feet burning. They\u2019ll also take longer to recover, she notes. Not exactly, but there are safer spaces, Pontious says. For healthy people who are not immunocompromised and don\u2019t have underlying foot problems, the ideal environment is somewhere debris-free and freshly cleaned. The problem is that even indoors, we can never be certain of what\u2019s on the floor. \u201cI have people who live in what they claim is a very clean home, and they\u2019ll step on a staple that got into the rug,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so small that you don\u2019t see it until it\u2019s in your foot.\u201d That\u2019s also why it\u2019s ideal to wear water shoes on the beach. Tiny pieces of shells or coral, jellyfish that have washed ashore, super-hot sand, and shards of glass bottles can all ruin an otherwise sunny day. If you\u2019re determined to go barefoot, keep an eye on the sand and pay close attention to potential hazards. Pontious advises that everyone practice foot-healthy habits, including checking daily that there aren\u2019t any cuts, sores, blisters, or other changes to the skin or nails. If you sweat a lot, bring an extra pair of socks with you to work or outdoor activities. Halfway through the sweaty activity, wash your feet with a cleansing wipe and some sweat-absorbing powder, and change your socks (and don\u2019t forget to put your shoes back on). A final word of advice for those still tempted by the podiatric version of going commando: \u201cIf you embrace this trend, you better have your podiatrist on speed dial,\u201d Parthasarathy says. \u201cBecause I guarantee you will need it.\u201d",

        "title": "Biden: Putin 'Absolutely' Weakened by Wagner Mutiny",
        "content": "President Biden on Wednesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cabsolutely\u201d had been weakened by the short-lived uprising of the Wagner Group. But, Biden added, it\u2019s unclear what that means for Putin\u2019s grip on power as his war with Ukraine grinds on. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell really. He\u2019s clearly losing the Iraq war,\u201d Biden said, mixing up the word Iraq for Ukraine. \u201cHe\u2019s losing the war at home and he has become a bit of a pariah around the world.\u201d Biden\u2019s comments, made as he walked toward the Marine One helicopter to start a trip to Chicago for a speech highlighting his economic efforts, marked a departure from his deliberate and careful approach over the past few days to the unrest in Russia. As Putin faced a deadly rebellion from his own mercenary forces, it may have been tempting for an American President to gloat. But until Wednesday, Biden had bent over backwards to stay out of it, and worked to be sure key Western allies stayed out of it too. Biden was concerned that cheering on the unrest inside Russia would give Putin an opening to blame the U.S. for the privately-run Wagner Group turning on Russia\u2019s formal military forces. As reports came out on Saturday that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner Group\u2019s leader, had turned on the Russian military and was marching north with his mercenary forces toward Russia,, Biden pushed off a planned helicopter flight to the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland\u2019s Catoctin Mountains and stayed in the White House, where he convened calls with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom. The message: Don\u2019t give Putin an opening to blame outside forces for the internal mess. Biden\u2019s national security team was concerned that the U.S. and its allies could overstate the threat to Putin\u2019s hold on power, said a White House official. Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s National Security Advisor, canceled a scheduled trip to Copenhagen for a conference with Ukraine, and instead traveled to Camp David with Biden on Saturday afternoon to keep the President updated on events in Russia. \u201cWe made clear that we were not involved. We had nothing to do with it. This was part of a struggle within the Russian system,\u201d Biden said Monday afternoon in the White House. Allied leaders \u201dagreed with me that we had to make sure we gave Putin no excuse \u2014 let me emphasize \u2014 we gave Putin no excuse to blame this on the West or to blame this on NATO,\u201d Biden said. The measured response to Russia\u2019s instability is a strategy that takes a page from George H. W. Bush\u2019s careful approach to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, ever mindful of the dangers that unrest and a power vacuum would pose in nuclear-armed Russia. \u201cThe U.S. Administration probably took the smartest approach here because I think there\u2019s no doubt that this seems to be an internal issue, and I think it\u2019s pretty clear it was not even a coup,\u201d Molly Dunigan, an expert at the non-profit RAND Corporation who has researched the role of private militaries in conflicts. \u201cThis was what one of my colleagues has called \u2018a contract renegotiation gone wrong\u2019.\u201d Dunigan\u2019s research has found that when private military forces are deployed alongside regular armies, \u201ca whole host of frictions\u201d emerge, Dunigan says. \u201cIt can really negatively impact your military effectiveness over time because there\u2019s all this tension that erupts and lots of resentment between the forces.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s summer counteroffensive against Russian military positions holding large swaths of eastern Ukraine has moved more slowly than expected, as Ukrainian forces probe for weakness in Russia\u2019s frontline defenses. White House officials are watching to see if the Wagner Group\u2019s mutiny created enough disarray in the Russian military command to weaken Russia\u2019s ability to repel additional Ukrainian advances. \u201cOne part of Biden\u2019s wisdom was not to rush before it was clear what was going on,\u201d says Konstantin Sonin, a professor at University of Chicago with expertise in Russian political and economic issues. The biggest impact of the revolt may be felt on the front lines in Ukraine. \u201cThe main thing is that this was good for Ukraine and Ukraine armed forces,\u201d Sonin says. The Biden administration on Tuesday announced $500 million in new security assistance for Ukraine. That package includes more Patriot missiles for defending Ukraine cities and military installations from Russian air attacks, shoulder-fired Stinger missiles and HIMARS ammunition for downing Russian aircraft, shoulder fired Javelin missiles for destroying tanks, 30 Bradley armored fighting vehicles, 25 Stryker armored personnel carriers, and additional equipment for clearing mines. Biden spoke to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky from Camp David on Sunday. The two leaders discussed the Wagner Group\u2019s assault on Russian forces and Ukraine\u2019s ongoing counter-offensive operations. Biden said on Monday that he told Zelensky \u201cthat no matter what happened in Russia \u2014 let me say it again: No matter what happened in Russia, we, the United States, would continue to support Ukraine\u2019s defense and its sovereignty and its territorial integrity.\u201d",

        "title": "How Barbie Land Was Created: Sets Design, Costumes",
        "content": "Barbie is a movie that benefits from multiple screenings. On every viewing, you\u2019ll catch something different, whether it\u2019s a big idea or a tiny detail. When it hits theaters on July 21, every person who has ever dressed a Barbie up is bound to recognize some outfit or prop from their childhood, whether they played with the doll in the 1960s or 1990s. And even the Barbie agnostic will find something to pick up, whether it\u2019s references to the technicolor musicals of Old Hollywood or a famous scene from The Matrix. Filmed primarily at a studio in London, the story of Barbie begins in a pink wonderland called Barbie Land where there\u2019s an all-female Supreme Court, and, as Helen Mirren\u2019s narrator tells the audience, \u201call problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved.\u201d The Barbies celebrate their good fortune with nightly slumber parties. It\u2019s a lived-in fantasy world that relies primarily on physical sets rather than CGI. To build out Barbie Land, writer-director Greta Gerwig decided to create a coherent set of rules that would govern how it looked and functioned. In order to do that, she dove into the history of Barbie, the history of movies, and the history of fashion. For a cover story on the new film, Gerwig, producer and star Margot Robbie, and creatives at Mattel spoke to TIME about how they dreamt up all the details in the film. Over the course of 2018 and 2019, Gerwig, Robbie, and folks from Robbie\u2019s production company LuckyChap went through an immersion course designed by Mattel. The unofficial Barbie bootcamp began with the doll\u2019s origin story\u2014Barbie was created by Ruth Handler\u2014and took a tour through some of Barbie\u2019s best outfits over the years. Read More: How Barbie Came to Life This research served as inspiration for the story. Handler\u2019s relationship with her daughter Barbara (after whom Barbie is named) manifested as a plot point involving a mother and daughter in the film. \u201cA Barbie movie is only ever going to be a mother-daughter movie on so many levels because it was Ruth Handler and Barbara\u2014that was the relationship,\u201d says Gerwig. Gerwig and filmmaker Noah Baumbach, her co-writer and partner, also had to build a world from scratch. They came up with rules for Barbie Land to keep everything coherent. \u201cYou see a seamless universe that all makes sense, and that\u2019s because there were these very specific boundaries about what could and couldn\u2019t happen,\u201d says Kate McKinnon, who plays one of the Barbies. One such rule? Barbie Land is a utopia, so nothing can be cluttered. There is no trash. \u201cNothing is dirty in the world, even when it gets its most chaotic,\u201d says McKinnon. \u201cI was struck by that.\u201d Given that Barbie first came to market in 1959, Gerwig and Oscar-nominated production designer Sarah Greenwood decided to run with a midcentury modern aesthetic for Barbie\u2019s Dream House and many of her fashions. Barbie lives on the sort of suburban cul de sac idealized in that era. The Dream Houses were built without walls so the actors had to be attached to wires to make sure they didn\u2019t topple off the top floors of their homes when they got out of bed. But the cast says everything else in their Dream Houses was surprisingly functional: They would sit on the retro chairs and hang out talking between takes. \u201cWe all just wanted to kick it in each other\u2019s living rooms because they were so fabulous,\u201d says Alexandra Shipp, who plays an author Barbie. Read More: Why It Took 64 Years to Make a Barbie Movie Skipper\u2019s house is the only one on the block that\u2019s purple instead of pink. Leaves are growing out of the roof, and a swing is tied to a protruding branch. Technically it is the Chelsea Tree House\u2014nearly an exact replica, scaled up to fit human actors. In fact, everything in Barbie Land is built to a specific scale to look \u201ctoyetic.\u201d \u201cThe scale is not life-like,\u201d says Lisa McKnight, the executive vice president at Mattel whose job is specifically to oversee the marketing of Barbie and dolls. For instance, Barbie the character\u2019s Corvette is just a little too small for Robbie, just as Barbie the doll\u2019s convertible is a little too small for her: The windshield only comes up to her chest. Gerwig\u2019s team didn\u2019t just study midcentury furniture trends. The filmmaker also revisited the films of Old Hollywood to capture the look of those stories. Rather than using a green screen to ensure that there were only bright blue skies in idyllic Barbie Land, Gerwig\u2019s team hand-painted the backdrops to look like old soundstage musicals. In an early scene, Ken tries to interact with a set backdrop with disastrous results. Read More: Barbie\u2019s Got a New Body Many of the props on set were also painted by hand, from the trees to the pool that sits outside of Barbie\u2019s Dream House and contains no water. \u201cI remember even the bark of the palm trees had different shades of brown, green, and even pink,\u201d says McKnight. Barbie is filled with dance numbers that are heavily influenced by 1940s and 50s Technicolor musicals like Singin\u2019 in the Rain. During filming, Robbie\u2019s production company LuckyChap hosted a film festival of sorts playing movies that influenced Barbie. But Gerwig didn\u2019t limit herself to one era. The movie is stuffed with references to all sorts of films ranging from Rocky to 2001: A Space Odyssey to Clueless. Barbie Land comes to life in the details. Gerwig obsessed over it all, and the props that populate the fantastical space imbue it with a surprisingly lived-in quality, like a Barbie version of the book Moby Dick on a side table. All the letters in Barbie\u2019s mailbox have been scribbled upon in a nonsense language, like a child might write. Barbie devotees know that Pantone 219 is Barbie\u2019s very specific shade of pink. A giant Pantone 219 chip sits outside the Barbie conference room at Mattel. But the set used so much pink paint\u2014in that specific color as well as secondary and tertiary shades\u2014that it precipitated a worldwide shortage. The sheer number of pinks in every shot presented their own challenge. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have seen or will ever see a film with more pink in it,\u201d says producer David Heyman, who helped build another famous fantasy world with the Harry Potter film series. \u201cAnd then how to handle that photographically\u2014thank goodness we had Rodrigo Prieto, who was able to balance all that and create a beautiful and rich palette.\u201d The soundtrack is filled with today\u2019s top artists, but even the singers were chosen with intention. Issa Rae, who plays President Barbie, points out that Barbie\u2019s image among adults has been buoyed in recent years by Nicki Minaj, who has adopted the name \u201cBarbie\u201d as one of her personas. Minaj, along with Ice Spice, are the ones remixing Aqua\u2019s old \u201cBarbie Girl\u201d song in a wink to Barbie\u2019s influence on music throughout the years. \u201cMy Barbie association is Nicki Minaj,\u201d says Rae. \u201cSo it\u2019s dope that she is a part of this movie in some way.\u201d Beyond the Barbie immersion course, Gerwig and Baumbach did their own deep dive to dig up even more details about particularly strange or controversial outfits or dolls Mattel produced over the years. Robbie\u2019s Barbie and Ryan Gosling\u2019s Ken donned collector\u2019s items that we won\u2019t spoil for superfans. And, yes, some of the stranger toys show up in the movie too. The marketing rollout has already revealed that the pregnant Midge doll who quite literally popped a baby out makes an appearance in the film. (Emerald Fennell has the honor of portraying the unusual toy.) Read More: What to Know About Midge and Allan, the Deepest Cuts From the Barbie Movie  Oscar-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran was charged with replicating some of Barbie\u2019s most iconic looks. She had a direct line to Kim Culmone, the head of design for fashion dolls at Mattel, who in turn would dive deep into the archives to provide the filmmaking team with references. Every bathing suit and camp shirt was handmade and silk screened and completely custom. \u201cWhether it\u2019s 1950s ladylike attire or a Western Barbie and Ken look or the rollerblades, those looks stick out to me as really toyetic,\u201d says Culmone. \u201cAnd that was important because even though we were putting Barbie in the real world, there was always a commitment to serve the fans of Barbie with these toyetic references.\u201d But the specific touches are what truly made the set a work of art. At one point during the movie, Ken walks around in a pair of boxing shoes that are made specifically for smooth surfaces, which is fine because there\u2019s no real grass, gravel, or dirt in Barbie Land.",

        "title": "How Wildfire Smoke Affects Wildlife, Plants, and Your Pets",
        "content": "Authorities have urged people across swaths of the Midwest and Northeast to stay indoors as smoke from Canadian wildfires compromises air quality in more than a dozen U.S. states. Inhaling wildfire smoke can lead to health issues ranging from coughing and wheezing to more serious respiratory and cardiovascular problems, particularly for those with underlying conditions\u2014hence why officials have told people in affected areas to avoid going outside if possible, and to wear a good-quality mask if it can\u2019t be avoided. Officials in New York City, where air quality is particularly bad, have even enacted a \u201cwork suspension\u201d for carriage horses, citing unsafe conditions. That raises an important point: wildfires pose risks to wildlife as well as humans\u2014and animals often don\u2019t have the luxury of staying indoors, says Olivia Sanderfoot, a postdoctoral fellow who studies the effects of wildfire smoke on wildlife at the La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science at University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cAnimals, just like us, need to breathe,\u201d Sanderfoot says. \u201cIf the air that they\u2019re breathing is full of toxic particles, that is going to have an impact on their health.\u201d Just as with humans, animals may experience respiratory distress, inflammation, and poor immune function in smoky conditions, she says. Many plant and animal species have, however, adapted to survive and even thrive in wildfire conditions. Fires can spark new plant growth by burning up debris, improving soil fertility, and allowing certain types of seeds to germinate, for example. \u201cFires are not inherently a bad thing. Wildfires are a natural disturbance,\u201d Sanderfoot says. The difference is that now, largely due to human behavior and climate change, wildfires are growing more intense and causing more extreme and far-flung ripple effects. It\u2019s not yet clear how these changing fire patterns will affect plants and animals over time. But relatively short-term smoke exposure isn\u2019t likely to lead to mass crop or livestock death, says Gail Carlson, an assistant professor of environmental studies at Colby College. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s harmless, though. \u201cAir pollution is a major, major health threat, and that is true for anybody with lungs,\u201d Carlson says. That goes for pets too, says Lori Teller, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. There\u2019s no exact threshold at which smoke exposure becomes dangerous, as it depends on your pet\u2019s age and overall health, as well as the air quality in your area. But if local conditions are bad, Teller recommends keeping pets indoors with the windows closed (except for short bathroom breaks, if necessary) and looking for ways they can play and exercise inside. If your pet has been exposed to smoke, look for warning signs like coughing, gagging, panting, difficulty breathing, red or watery eyes, runny nose, fatigue, disorientation, and significantly decreased appetite, Teller says. If your pet is exhibiting these red flags, you may want to consult a veterinarian, who can treat your animal with medication, oxygen therapy, or other remedies if necessary. As for wild animals? There\u2019s not much humans can do to offer immediate help, Sanderfoot says, beyond investing in initiatives that support habitat restoration and conservation and supporting more robust climate policies. \u201cWe need to keep our attention focused on how smoke is impacting our communities and wildlife even when we have blue skies,\u201d Sanderfoot says. \u201cThe work that needs to be done to mitigate these events, and reduce risks when they happen, cannot be done just during the crisis.\u201d",

        "title": "White Women Must Do More To Confront Racism",
        "content": "In 2019, we decided to host anti-racism events in white women\u2019s dining rooms for one specific reason: To turn the age-old adage, \u201cit\u2019s rude to talk about politics at the dinner table\u201d on its head. This is what we\u2019ve learned\u2014if you don\u2019t talk about racism, you can\u2019t dismantle it. But it isn\u2019t just over the dinner table that this \u201cniceness\u201d rules. In the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020, you were eager, frenzied even, to do this work. A mere two years later, not only is that excitement for anti-racism work gone, the pendulum has swung in the other direction, into a verifiable whitelash against anti-racism work. If white womanhood is a house, your need to be perfect is the foundation. It is this need for perfection that makes it impossible to engage in antiracism work. Being perfect is the key to your happiness, to your success, to your very existence. Perfect hair. Perfect clothes. Perfect grades. Perfect nails. Perfect weddings. Perfect bodies. Perfect adoring and supportive wife and mother. Perfect employee and colleague. White skin. The foundational principle of perfection in a white supremacist society like ours is rooted in whiteness. Without it, your A\u2019s will never be straight enough, your MVP trophies not shiny enough, your flowery dresses a bit wilted. Of course, white skin alone doesn\u2019t render you perfect, but without it, you have no chance. White skin is a necessary (yet still insufficient) ingredient of perfection. The con, of course, is there is no actual recipe for perfection, as there is no such thing as perfection. Read More: How the \u2018Karen Meme\u2019 Confronts the Violent History of White Womanhood This makes your endless quest for perfection a trap. You will never be pretty enough. You will never be thin enough. You will never be smart enough or successful enough or rich enough. You will never be enough. Yet white women will die trying. Especially over dinner. We call it the \u201cThree Point Plan for Perfectionism.\u201d It goes like this: You\u2019ve been taught generation after generation that talking about politics over a meal is rude. Being rude is the enemy of perfection. Being perfect is your number one life goal, so you will not talk about racism. White women regularly mention having been \u201cburned\u201d on social media for saying the \u201cwrong thing.\u201d You have been publicly humiliated, often at the hands of a fellow white woman, who is angling to show you how much more perfect she is at antiracism work. Yes, you even compete in the antiracism space. Getting called out makes you want to stop the work, to stop engaging. If you aren\u2019t already perfect at it, then you don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. Yet if you stop the work, you can\u2019t make progress. Then there are those situations in which the critique of you is coming from a woman of color. This will hit you in a deeply uncomfortable place. After all, you are not used to having us challenge you\u2014and on a topic we absolutely know more about: being on the receiving end of racism. This, in particular, infuriates white women. Us publicly calling you out on your racism. Us publicly telling you that you are not perfect. Antiracism work depends on your acknowledging your imperfections, namely how you have been born into and nurtured by a white supremacist society. This means acknowledging that you are not the expert on how it feels to be on the receiving end of racism, which means you do not get to decide what is and is not racist. Just like men don\u2019t get to decide what is and is not sexist. It means acknowledging that you will get it wrong, that you will feel embarrassed, and that you will struggle to make progress. In spite of these obstacles and this necessary discomfort, you will have to pick yourself up and get back into the work\u2014work that is messy, not tidy. Work that is tables turned upside down, not neatly set. Work that is imperfect. So, why show up? Why do this work now? Because you must. You\u2019ll do it because not only is it the right thing to do, but you know that your lives, and your kids\u2019 and your grandkids\u2019 lives, depend on your showing up, even when things get hard. You will show up because you understand that white supremacy hurts you too. You are doing this not to save us, but to free yourselves. So the next time you think things like, \u201cI didn\u2019t pipe up on Facebook because I don\u2019t want to be attacked,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to say the wrong thing,\u201d or \u201cThe last time I called someone out at a dinner party, my husband was grumpy with me for a week,\u201d think about this: The only wrong move is remaining silent, sitting on the sidelines, accepting your role in white supremacy. Don\u2019t do nothing out of the fear of doing it imperfectly. Get in there. Read. Listen. Learn. Speak up. Speak out. Show up. Roll up your sleeves. And when you receive criticism, consider that maybe it\u2019s just that: a critique, and not an attack. Maybe this disagreement isn\u2019t a fight. Maybe you don\u2019t know more than the Black, Indigenous, or brown woman attempting to set you straight. And isn\u2019t freedom from white supremacy worth some level of conflict? Isn\u2019t it more important to eradicate racism than to be liked by everybody? You\u2019ve never been liked by everybody in the first place! In the end, you cannot even start the process of extracting white supremacy until you extract the need to be perfect. The need to be perfect is not just harmful to us, it\u2019s harmful to you. Aren\u2019t you tired of never being enough?

        "title": "How Wagner's Prigozhin Used Telegram to Challenge Putin",
        "content": "For nearly a decade, Yevgeny Prigozhin built a mercenary empire in the shadows. For eight years, he steadfastly denied his connection to the Wagner Group, the infamous paramilitary company he founded in May 2014, even going as far as to sue news outlets for correctly linking him to the group. It was only in Sept. 2022, after Prigozhin appeared in a video recruiting convicts to fill Wagner\u2019s ranks, that he finally acknowledged that he was the leader of the sprawling network of private military contractors and shell companies serving the Kremlin\u2019s interests from Ukraine to Syria to sub-Saharan Africa. \u201cThe time of revelation has come,\u201d Prigozhin said in a statement posted on social media, bragging that he had turned Wagner into one of the \u201cpillars of our Motherland\u201d and \u201cfoundation of Russian patriotism.\u201d Suddenly, the Russian oligarch and onetime Vladimir Putin confidante was everywhere. Prigozhin opened a Wagner headquarters in St. Petersburg, claimed credit for meddling in U.S. elections, and started posting hundreds of messages, videos, and photos on the messaging app Telegram. Over the course of seven months, the formerly secretive leader built a Telegram channel with 1.3 million followers, morphing from an unofficial extension of the Kremlin to a prominent figure with a direct connection to the Russian public. Prigozhin used Telegram to circumvent the Kremlin\u2019s state media apparatus, meeting Russians on the platform where they sought uncensored news from the war in Ukraine. As Wagner troops became heavily involved in the fighting, especially in the battles around Bakhmut, he became one of the most prominent faces of Russia\u2019s war, issuing a steady steam of often-graphic video messages from the front lines. As the war dragged on, he bristled at the Russian defense department\u2019s moves to subsume his mercenary army, taking on the country\u2019s military leadership and elite in screaming tirades that painted them as indifferent to the deaths of ordinary soldiers. When Prigozhin launched a dramatic insurrection against Russia\u2019s military leaders on June 23, he launched and narrated it in a series of stunning voice messages on his Telegram channel. Read More: How Telegram Became the Digital Battlefield in the Russia-Ukraine War. The short-lived mutiny pitted two skilled propagandists and former allies against one another. While Putin has tightly controlled narratives about the war within Russia through state media and television, analysts say, he may have underestimated the influence of Prigozhin\u2019s growing reach online. The following Prigozhin built on Telegram \u201cwas very clearly a method for him to be able to raise his political profile,\u201d says Catrina Doxsee, an expert on the Wagner Group and associate director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIt became valuable to have all of that credibility as leverage.\u201d Prigozhin was once known as \u201cPutin\u2019s chef,\u201d thanks to the catering business he operated with links to the Kremlin. Back in 2016, he did Putin\u2019s bidding in a notorious influence operation conducted over social media: he was the person behind the Internet Research Agency, the notorious troll farm accused of attempting to manipulate the 2016 presidential race to boost Donald Trump. Prigozhin \u201cis a creation of Putin,\u201d says Joana de Deus Pereira, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute-Europe think tank. \u201cBut this is a typical case where the creation turns against the creator.\u201d The Telegram channel that would become Prigozhin\u2019s megaphone was created on Nov. 5, 2022 as the press arm of his company Concord Management and Consulting. Until then, a cluster of unofficial Wagner and fan accounts on Telegram, with names like \u201cPrigozhin\u2019s Cap,\u201d had distributed news about him and his group on the app, which had become the digital battle space of the war in Ukraine. Prigozhin would now be posting updates on this account, the first message said, so he could \u201cguarantee that all statements are published from me personally.\u201d The channel took off quickly, with dozens of videos showing the Wagner boss on the front lines. In January, one purported to show Prigozhin in a hospital, shaking the hands of Wagner fighters wounded in combat. In others, he stood in full combat gear on a rooftop in Bakhmut, demanding more ammunition. Prigozhin was \u201cbuilding a political persona in a kind of competition with Putin, to prove who was the most patriotic, the best Russian, the flagship of Russian values,\u201d says Pereira. He sought \u201cto be portrayed as a symbol of true patriotism and of the common soldier of Russia, the one that suffers on the field, the one that has blood in his hands,\u201d she says. Russian news, including state media, began to cover some of Prigozhin\u2019s videos on Telegram, even featuring criticism from his fighters, who complained about shortages of ammunition and armored vehicles. As Prigozhin grew bolder, Russian state-backed media outlets were instructed not to quote him unless it was about positive developments from the battlefield, according to the independent news outlet Verstka. \u201cWagner\u2019s relative successes tipped the balance of power in Prigozhin\u2019s favor [and] gave him room to openly criticize the Kremlin\u2019s strategy in the conflict,\u201d says Pereira. \u201cIt was something unimaginable just months ago.\u201d As the mercenary leader became more visible, he began to imply that any negative stories about him were being planted by the Russian military because Wagner\u2019s fighters were outperforming Russian forces on the battlefield. \u201cPeople in uniform could be discrediting me,\u201d he said in a Telegram post. \u201cChiefly those close to the military. Because many of them can\u2019t achieve the same effectiveness that Wagner has.\u201d Open criticism of the war is so rare\u2014and often illegal\u2014that it was widely assumed Prigozhin\u2019s comments were tacitly sanctioned by Putin, including his vitriolic barrages against Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, analysts tell TIME. On May 4, Prigozhin posted an expletive-riddled video on Telegram directed at Russia\u2019s military leadership, shining a flashlight on rows of bloodied bodies that he said were Wagner fighters killed in Bakhmut. \u201cYou scum sit there in your expensive clubs, your kids are all enjoying life, recording their little YouTube videos,\u201d he spat at the camera, standing in the dark, illuminated by a spotlight. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about basic calculations: if you hand over the ammo quota, there\u2019d be five times fewer [dead].\u201d Then Prigozhin took it a step further, posting a dramatic video in which he directly addressed Putin while dressed in full combat uniform surrounded by fighters. He threatened to withdraw Wagner Group units from Bakhmut: \u201cWithout ammunition, they\u2019re doomed to die meaningless deaths.\u201d He made good on that threat in late May, accusing Russia\u2019s leaders of intentionally starving his troops of munitions. \u201cThere will be no more meat grinder because there\u2019s nothing left to grind the meat with,\u201d he declared in a Telegram video. In early June, Shoigu announced plans to require soldiers with private military companies, including Wagner, to sign contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry by July 1. Prigozhin\u2019s screeds escalated as he saw his business empire threatened. He announced that his group would not comply. \u201cNone of Wagner\u2019s fighters is ready to go down the path of shame again,\u201d Prigozhin posted in a video on June 14. \u201cThat\u2019s why they will not sign the contracts.\u201d On June 23, Prigozhin accused the Russian military of ordering a rocket strike on Wagner\u2019s field camps in Ukraine, vowing to punish \u201cthose who destroyed our lads\u201d by embarking on a \u201cMarch for Justice.\u201d In a Telegram video, he attacked Putin\u2019s justification for the invasion of Ukraine itself, challenging his claims point by point. \u201cThe war wasn\u2019t needed to return Russian citizens to our bosom, nor to de-militarize or de-Nazify Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe war was needed so that a bunch of animals could simply exult in glory.\u201d This was an extraordinary challenge to Putin\u2019s leadership. \u201cNot only is it a blow to Putin\u2019s narrative about the war, but it is coming from a trusted insider, who has already built up a reputation amongst the people,\u201d says Doxsee. \u201cAnd that is a huge blow to Putin\u2019s power and credibility.\u201d Wagner forces occupied the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, and moved north without opposition, advancing to within about 120 miles of Moscow before turning back. The Kremlin sought to block information about the putsch on Google News, appeared to cause Telegram outages in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Rostov-on-Don, and throttled Internet searches for Prigozhin on news sites and social-media networks. But the series of voice notes the mercenary leader posted on Telegram over the course of the revolt were still listened to more than 55 million times, according to TIME\u2019s review. Prigozhin has reportedly been exiled to Belarus under a deal brokered by the country\u2019s President Alexander Lukashenko on June 25, and his channel briefly fell silent. But on Monday he reappeared in more voice notes on Telegram. \u201cWhen on June 23-24 we walked past Russian cities, civilians met us with the flags of Russia and with the emblems and flags of the Wagner PMC,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of them still write words of support, and some are disappointed that we stopped.\u201d Prigozhin\u2019s future is uncertain. But as long as he has access to his Telegram channel, he will pose a threat to Putin, wherever he may be.",

        "title": "Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose launches GOP Senate bid",
        "content": "CLEVELAND \u2014 Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose launched a long-anticipated Senate bid Monday, becoming the third prominent Republican to run in an already fractious primary field that will determine who takes on Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown in 2024. \"I, for one, believe that the country is heading in a dangerous direction,\" LaRose said in an interview. \"If we don't turn the tide and put things back on track, then we're going to have a real mess on our hands.\" The race figures to be one of the most competitive in the country next year. Brown's seat, in a state former President Donald Trump twice won by comfortable margins, is among the GOP's prized pickup opportunities, alongside contests in Arizona, Montana and West Virginia. LaRose, 44, will aim to straddle two distinct lanes in a GOP race that features two rivals with substantial self-funding capabilities. Bernie Moreno \u2014 a businessman running with Trump\u2019s encouragement but for now without an official endorsement \u2014 is running as a loyalist of the former president. State Sen. Matt Dolan \u2014 a more policy-oriented conservative whose family owns Cleveland\u2019s Major League Baseball franchise, the Guardians \u2014 is running as an antidote to Trump\u2019s inflammatory politics. In his launch video, LaRose emphasized his Army service, saying he is \"a Green Beret, a conservative, a man of faith \u2014 and I'm not afraid of a fight.\" LaRose has championed a ballot initiative that would require a 60% vote \u2014 as opposed to a simple majority \u2014 to amend the Ohio Constitution. If the measure passes in an August special election, the higher threshold would be in place for an amendment to protect abortion rights that is expected to be on the November ballot. Moreno's campaign welcomed LaRose to the race by accusing him of shifting his focus away from a special election in which early voting is underway. \"Like a true career politician, Frank LaRose has spent the last 13 years of his life constantly running for higher office,\" Moreno spokesperson Conor McGuinness said. \"With the all-important Issue 1 vote coming up in August, he should instead focus on the job he has.\" LaRose, a former state senator, fired back: \"Has he suspended his campaign to campaign exclusively for Issue 1? If he had, maybe I would take that seriously.\" Democrats are watching with glee. \u201cThe Republican \u2018slugfest\u2019 for Ohio\u2019s Senate seat is shaping up to be another long, contentious battle that will leave whoever emerges damaged in the eyes of Ohio voters,\u201d Ohio Democratic Party spokesperson Reeves Oyster said in a statement in response to LaRose\u2019s campaign launch. \u201cIn the days ahead, the people of Ohio should ask themselves: what is Frank LaRose really doing for us?\u201d LaRose enters the primary as the Republican most familiar to voters. He has won two statewide races, including re-election last year as secretary of state. A recent poll by East Carolina University showed him essentially tied in the teens with Dolan, who finished third in the Senate primary last year, with 58% of GOP voters undecided at this early stage. Moreno, a well-known former car dealer in the Cleveland area who dropped out of the 2022 contest months before the primary, was chosen by 7% of the poll\u2019s Republican respondents. But LaRose also enters the race as the most meagerly funded of the three. Unlike Moreno and Dolan, he lacks vast personal wealth to draw from and has spent recent months urging donors to support a nonprofit group his political allies started to keep him on competitive footing. Dolan, by contrast, has already begun airing TV ads. And Moreno is off to a strong fund-raising start. LaRose said in Monday\u2019s interview that in recent months, he has helped raise more than $1 million into an aligned super PAC that he has since departed because he is now a declared candidate and cannot coordinate with the group. \"I'm the only one in the race that isn't a millionaire,\" LaRose said. \"So I'm going to do this the old-fashioned way, the entrepreneurial way. ... We're going to have the resources to win this race, because nobody will outwork me.\" Trump endorsed LaRose's re-election bid for secretary of state last year \u2014 a fact that LaRose emphasizes. LaRose also said Monday that he has been in touch with Trump advisers and would welcome an endorsement. But he also said he has not decided whom to endorse in next year's Republican presidential primaries. At a private event this year, LaRose downplayed the sway Trump holds over GOP voters, according to audio leaked to Politico and NBC News. LaRose, unlike other Republican candidates for secretary of state last year, also has said he does not believe the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. More recently, LaRose put distance between himself and Trump after Trump was indicted over his handling of classified documents. A spokesperson at the time offered a statement that gently rebuked Trump \u2014 though not by name \u2014 and included criticism of how the Justice Department is handling the case. Moreno, on the other hand, attended Trump\u2019s defiant speech at his New Jersey golf club the evening after his arraignment. But LaRose also has made overtures to GOP activists who made false or exaggerated claims about voter fraud. His office launched a public integrity unit, and he appeared on a panel with election deniers during this year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. In the news release announcing his candidacy, LaRose dismissed Dolan and Moreno as insufficiently conservative. And in Monday's interview, LaRose boasted of a new agency within the secretary of state's office that will analyze election data \u2014 an effort he described as a Trump-friendly policy. The funding for agency, which LaRose pushed for, comes from the recently passed state budget, which Dolan, as chair of the Ohio Senate's Finance Committee, had a major role in passing. Chris Maloney, a Dolan strategist, noted that LaRose praised his soon-to-be rival after the budget was signed into law. \"Now, as a candidate for U.S. Senate, Frank is attacking him,\" Maloney said. \"It just reinforces the fact that on any given day, it's unclear which version of Frank LaRose is actually going to show up for work.\"",

        "content": "The deaths of four women whose bodies were found from February to May in and around Portland, Oregon, are linked, authorities said Monday. Investigators have identified \"at least\" one person of interest linked to the deaths of Kristin Smith, 22; Charity Perry, 24; Bridget Webster, 31; and Ashely Real, 22, the Multnomah County District Attorney\u2019s Office said in a statement. The person was not identified and no charges have been filed, and authorities declined to provide additional information about what connects the cases, citing ongoing death investigations. The prosecutor\u2019s office added that the cause and manner of death in each case remain under investigation by the state medical examiner\u2019s office. \"Based on the available information to investigators, there is not believed to be any active danger to the community at this time,\" the DA's statement said. Smith was found Feb. 19 in southeast Portland. Perry was discovered in a culvert on Multnomah County's East Historic Columbia River Highway on April 24. Webster was found six days later on a rural road in nearby Polk County, while Real was found in a wooded area in another nearby county, Clackamas, on May 7. In an interview last month, Webster's stepgrandfather said he'd changed her diapers, taught her to play basketball and raised her until she left home as a freshman in high school. \"She was a good girl until I lost contact with her years ago,\" he said. The release did not mention the cases of two other women found dead in the region during the same time frame. NBC affiliate KGW of Portland first reported the six deaths. The Portland Police Bureau said last month that authorities had found no evidence linking the deaths. The agency said that \"widely distributed social media posts and news media articles\" that suggested a connection between the deaths had caused fear and anxiety, \"and we want to provide reassurance that the speculation is not supported by the facts available at this point.\" In its release Monday, the prosecutor's office said nine law enforcement agencies throughout the region had worked \"collaboratively on numerous death investigations in Northwest Oregon\" to determine there were links among the four cases.",

        "title": "Georgia grand juries impaneled as Trump probe decision looms",
        "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 A Georgia judge on Tuesday seated two grand juries that are likely to be tasked with deciding whether to bring election interference charges against former President Donald Trump and his allies. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has said she plans to announce charging decisions stemming from an investigation into \"possible criminal interference in the administration of Georgia\u2019s 2020 general election\u201d during a Superior Court term that began Tuesday. Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney seated two grand juries that will hear cases over the length of term, which ends Sept. 1. Each panel consists of 23 jurors and three alternates. McBurney informed the grand jury members that they need only to find probable cause to indict a person and stressed that their decisions must be based on the law, not personal opinions. Willis has been conducting a sprawling investigation since early 2021 into whether Trump and his allies interfered in the state's election process during the last presidential election. She enlisted a special grand jury last year that was empowered to subpoena witnesses to assist in the probe, which looked at whether there were any \u201ccoordinated attempts to unlawfully alter the outcome of the 2020 elections.\u201d That panel recommended indicting more than a dozen people, its foreperson, Emily Kohrs, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News\u201d in February. The names have not been made public. \u201cThere are certainly names that you will recognize, yes. There are names also you might not recognize,\u201d Kohrs said at the time. Since then, a number of so-called fake electors \u2014 people who signed a certificate falsely declaring that Trump won Georgia in the 2020 election and that they were the state\u2019s official electors \u2014 have struck immunity deals with Willis\u2019 office, court filings show. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in the case and maintains Willis, a Democrat, is leading a politically motivated \"witch hunt\" against him. Willis has indicated that she could seek indictments in the case in the first half of August. \u201cI respectfully request that judges not schedule trials and in person hearings during the weeks beginning Monday, August 7 and Monday, August 14,\u201d Willis wrote in a letter in May to the chief judge of the Fulton County Courthouse. One of the grand juries impaneled Tuesday is scheduled to meet every Monday and Tuesday during the court's term, and the other is scheduled to convene Thursdays and Fridays. Both will hear cases two days a week. Unlike the special grand jury Willis used last year, the grand juries will hear all sorts of cases, not just those related to the election investigation. It takes 16 members to establish a quorum each day and 12 votes for an indictment. McBurney told the jurors they would be paid $25 a day for their service. Charlie Gile reported from Atlanta, and Dareh Gregorian reported from New York.",

        "title": "Joe Manchin and Jon Huntsman flirt with third-party 2024 ticket in New Hampshire",
        "content": "MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 No Labels is taking another new, notable step advancing toward a potential third-party presidential bid in 2024, organizing a campaign-style event in New Hampshire on Monday featuring Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. The move comes as the Washington-based advocacy organization looks to recruit a Democrat and a Republican to form a bipartisan presidential ticket in 2024 \u2014 a prospect that could send an unpredictable jolt through the 2024 presidential race, which as of now is trending toward a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. No Labels\u2019 founder and CEO, Nancy Jacobson, told NBC News that No Labels is near its fundraising goal of $70 million, which will go toward its efforts to gain ballot access for its would-be presidential ticket in all 50 states. No Labels is scheduled to hold a convention next April in Dallas, where it\u2019ll formally nominate its presidential ticket.  Manchin continued to leave open the door to a third-party presidential run with No Labels, repeatedly declining to rule it out in an interview with NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019ll be next year,\u201d Manchin said about his timeline to decide what to do, meaning speculation about it (and his West Virginia Senate seat) will linger into 2024.  \u201cLet\u2019s see where everybody goes. Let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d said Manchin, an outspoken critic of partisanship in Washington. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll come to their senses and start doing the job they were elected to do.\u201d Many national Democrats fear that Manchin, who has often bucked his party and scaled back parts of his Democratic colleagues\u2019 legislative agenda in Congress, could siphon votes from Biden if he or another prominent Democrat were to join a third-party ticket next year.  One of the most striking differences between Biden\u2019s win in 2020 and Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump four years earlier was the low share of voters who decided to pick a third-party candidate in 2020. The third-party vote share fell from 6% in 2016 to 2% in 2020. And according to the NBC News exit poll, most of those who voted third-party in 2016 decided to back Biden four years later, helping deny Trump re-election. Now, Democrats worry that a growing third-party vote in 2024 would serve to lower the threshold Trump needs to win again \u2014 as in 2016, when 47% to 48% of the vote was enough for him to capture key swing states. Manchin dismissed Democratic fears that a No Labels-fueled presidential run would boost Trump. \u201cNobody at No Labels that I\u2019ve ever spoken to would ever be a spoiler,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cThere is no spoiling going [on] here to give an advantage to one side or the other. We\u2019re hoping both sides come to their sensible middle.\u201d \u201cWhen are people going to say enough\u2019s enough?\u201d Manchin said about partisan politics. \u201cWe hear it every day. \u2018Enough is enough. Can\u2019t you work together? What about us? What about this great country of ours?\u2019\u201d Manchin wasn\u2019t the only party-bucking politician on the trail Monday: Republican Jon Huntsman, the former U.S. ambassador to China and Utah governor, also joined Manchin in New Hampshire. Ahead of their trip, No Labels heralded the pair as the headliners of its \u201cCommon Sense Townhall\u201d Monday night at Saint Anselm College, a common waypoint for presidential contenders. The two spoke earlier at a diner in Manchester to a group of guests who received private invitations.  Huntsman, who sought the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, told NBC News he has \u201cno plans at this point\u201d to run on a third-party ticket in 2024. No Labels\u2019 leaders, including former Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat-turned-independent, and former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, continue to remain mum about possible candidates, though two sources familiar with the group\u2019s deliberations told NBC News that the ticket could include individuals who have not previously been elected to public office. Last week, businessman Mark Cuban told NBC News that he would not join the No Labels ticket but lauded the group\u2019s plans as \u201cvery important,\u201d adding: \u201cI like that they are trying a new path. I think the two-party system is broken.\u201d A NBC News poll in June showed that 44% of voters nationally said they would consider voting for an independent or third-party candidate for president in 2024.  And crucially, the poll found that Democratic-leaning voters are more open to the idea of backing such a candidate \u2014 illustrating why voices in the party have been so outspoken against No Labels\u2019 2024 plans.",

In a brief, unanimous ruling, the nine-judge state Supreme Court said what Trump was seeking \"is not the sort of relief that this Court affords, at least absent extraordinary circumstances that Petitioner has not shown are present here.\" \"Moreover, even if the petition were procedurally appropriate, Petitioner has not shown that he would be entitled to the relief he seeks,\" the court said. A representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The DA\u2019s office declined to comment. A similar Trump petition filed Friday is pending before Fulton County Superior Court. Both petitions sought a court order barring Willis \u201cfrom introducing any evidence obtained via the special purpose grand jury process to a regular grand jury.\u201d The special grand jury recommended indicting more than a dozen people, its foreperson, Emily Kohrs, said on \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d in February.

Trump's petition asked both courts to act swiftly because Willis \u201chas signaled that she will use the report \u2014 itself the fruit of contorted and coopted process \u2014 to secure an indictment against Petitioner within weeks, if not days.\u201d Trump filed a similar petition in Fulton County Superior Court in March. The judge who has overseen the grand jury investigation, Robert McBurney, has yet to rule on that filing. Willis began her sprawling investigation in January 2021. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and maintained that Willis, a Democrat, is conducting a politically motivated \"witch hunt.\" In letters to local law enforcement agencies, Willis has indicated that she would most likely seek indictments during the first half of August.

        "content": "A stranded sailor and his dog have been rescued in the South Pacific Ocean after months at sea, rescuers told Australian media over the weekend. The sailor, Tim Shaddock, 51, and Bella, the dog, departed from La Paz, Mexico, three months ago. A month into his journey, a storm struck his white catamaran, wiping out all electronics, according to 9News. Shaddock said he and Bella survived three months at sea eating raw fish and drinking rainwater. They were rescued by a Mexican tuna trawler over the weekend, 9News reported. \u201cI have been through a very difficult ordeal at sea,\u201d Shaddock told the channel, adding that he had fishing and other survival gear with him. \u201cI\u2019m just needing rest and good food because I\u2019ve been alone at sea a long time,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI have not had food, enough food, for a long time.\u201d A doctor who treated Shaddock on the trawler told 9News that he had \u201cnormal vital signs.\u201d Shaddock and Bella were spotted last week by a helicopter accompanying a tuna trawler, which was on its way back to Mexico, according to 9News. It was unclear when Shaddock first left Mexico and where he and Bella were rescued. The trawler was on its way back to the west coast of Mexico, where Shaddock would get further care, according to 9News. Shaddock said he avoided sunburn by sheltering under his boat\u2019s canopy, eating raw fish and drinking rainwater.  Mike Tipton, a physiology professor at the extreme environment laboratory at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom, said, \u201cIf you get sunburn, that affects your ability to regulate your body temperature.\u201d He said Shaddock could otherwise sweat up to 1 or 2 liters an hour. \u201cIf you do absolutely nothing and you rest and you stay cool, you can get away with as less as 110 to 220 milliliters of water a day,\u201d he said. Shaddock had to look after not only himself, but also his dog, which Tipton said, helped them survive. \u201cHe had companionship. Once you\u2019ve got enough food and water, then I think the dog has an advantage,\u201d Tipton said. \"Your survival time is as long as you can keep collecting water, getting occasional food and doing things that help you stay positive.\u201d Finding Shaddock was like finding a \"needle in a haystack\" in the enormous Pacific Ocean, Tipton said, especially because the helicopter was not even actively looking for him. \"It was a combination of luck and the right behavior,\" he said.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday reiterated criticisms of Sen. Tommy Tuberville's blockade of hundreds of military nominations and again called on congressional Republicans to speak up. \"A cascading effect of delayed promotions threatens to brain-drain from the military,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"And military families do not know where they will live, where spouses will work, where children will go to school.\" Jean-Pierre also referred to previous statements Tuberville, R-Ala., has made about supporting the military, saying, \"Sen. Tuberville from 2021 and 2022 should intervene with 2023 Sen. Tuberville, because clearly there's a problem here.\" Tuberville has halted the normally routine process for military promotions in Congress as part of his objection to a Defense Department policy supporting service members and dependents seeking abortions. He said last week that he would consider lifting his holds if the abortion policy were put to a vote in Congress and if the White House and the Pentagon agreed that the policy would be removed if the vote were to fail. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Monday that not having the Pentagon's abortion policy would have an \"extremely, extremely significant impact\" on military recruiting and retention. \"What happens if you get assigned to a state like Alabama, which has a pretty restrictive abortion law in place, and you're concerned about your reproductive care? What do you do?\" Kirby asked. \"Do you say no and get out? Well, some people may decide to do that, and what does that mean? That means we lose talent, important talent.\" Kirby said the military's policies, including those supporting transgender and female service members, are a \"foundational, sacred obligation of military leaders.\" \"It matters because it says we're invested in you because you are being willing to invest in us,\" Kirby said. \"You're investing your life, your family's livelihood with us. We owe you that back in return.\" In response to NBC News' request for comment, a Tuberville spokesman said that what is really affecting recruiting is \"the Biden administration's politicizing the military.\" \u201cThe Biden administration seems a lot more concerned about 260 generals and admirals than about tens of thousands of missing recruits,\u201d the spokesman said. In April, military officials told the House Armed Services Committee that the Army, the Navy and the Air Force would not meet enlistment goals this year. Several Senate Republicans have been critical of Tuberville's hold on nominations. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has expressed concern over putting holds on military promotions as opposed to political nominees, while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said he does not support \"putting a hold on military nominations.\" NBC News reported Thursday that the White House is putting increased pressure on Republicans over Tuberville's blockade, according to a new memo. \u201cRight now, a Republican Senator is choosing to erode military readiness and abuse military families in the pursuit of an unrelated and extreme anti-freedom agenda \u2014 with barely a sound from his GOP colleagues,\u201d White House communications adviser Andrew Bates wrote in the memo.",

They would also give new powers to the state Legislature, where Republican lawmakers have been emboldened by a new veto-proof majority, along with a new Republican majority on the state Supreme Court. The three bills, which could be considered in House committee hearings as early as this week, come as North Carolina begins to institute new voter ID rules. The state Supreme Court had previously declared the photo ID requirements unconstitutional, but the new Republican majority reversed that decision earlier this year, allowing the law to be enacted.

Christopher Cooper, a professor and director of the Public Policy Institute at Western Carolina University, said the new election bills would add more uncertainty to a system that's already facing big changes. \"There's so much up in the air about what the Board of Elections is going to look like, how voter ID is going to be implemented, when our mail-in ballots are going to be allowed to be accepted,\" he said. \"Anybody who says they can tell you what North Carolina elections are gonna look like in 2024 is lying.\" Senate Bill 749 would overhaul state and local election boards, the five-person bodies that oversee democratic operations and certify election results. County election boards in North Carolina are tasked with running elections \u2014 registering voters, operating polling sites and counting ballots \u2014 while the state board appoints individuals to the county boards and oversees their work, while also handling campaign finance disclosures and compliance with the law. Currently, the state and county boards include three members of the governor's party and two members of the other party. Nominations are made by the parties, while appointments are made by the governor. The bill, which passed the Senate in June, would strip the governor of a role in the process. Instead, it would create an eight-person State Board of Elections, divided evenly between the two parties and appointed by party leaders in the state Legislature. County boards would be cut to four members \u2014 also evenly split along party lines and appointed by lawmakers. The new boards are designed to restore trust in elections by eliminating partisan advantage, advocates of the bill say, but experts warn that they could lead to a nightmare scenario: deadlocked boards tasked with completing the most critical tasks in election administration. The bill identifies a few scenarios in which the Legislature could step in to resolve an impasse \u2014 such as appointing a chairman of the election board \u2014 but offers no alternatives for deadlocks on key tasks like certifying election results. Throwing it to the Legislature would also, for now, benefit Republicans, who have a majority in both chambers \u2014 something they're likely to preserve thanks to aggressive and effective gerrymandering throughout the state. Meanwhile, the current Democratic governor would be cut out of the process in making appointments \u2014 and thereby controlling the balance of power on the boards. \u201cHow do they get anything done? Are the important decisions going to be deadlocked? The consequences of that, as we are learning, could be devastating,\u201d said Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause North Carolina. Early voting polling sites and schedules must be approved by the unanimous support of a county election board under current law, Phillips said. If a member of the county board objects, the state board must decide. If it cannot, he said, current law says the only early voting site would be the county board of elections office. Such a decision could have a devastating impact on turnout in large counties that might normally have more than a dozen early voting locations, he said, and leave voters in more rural, less populous counties forced to travel. This is at least the fourth time state Republicans have tried to secure power over the State Board of Elections in North Carolina since Democrat Roy Cooper won the governor\u2019s mansion in 2016. Two attempts to rework the election board were declared unconstitutional, while a third attempt \u2014 a constitutional amendment in 2018 \u2014 failed at the ballot box. John Hood, a member of the board of the conservative John Locke Foundation, said he believes this latest bill is also unconstitutional. \u201cThey assume that the North Carolina Supreme Court wouldn\u2019t rule the same way that previous courts have ruled in this question, but I don\u2019t think they should make that assumption,\u201d he told NBC News. At a press conference announcing SB 747 and SB 749, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger, a Republican whose district includes Rockingham and parts of Guilford, said he believed the previous decisions on election boards by the state Supreme Court might have been wrongly decided, pointing to the dissents on past rulings. The 2018 dissents were written by Republicans judges, who recently won the majority of the court. The majority leader\u2019s son Phil Berger Jr. is one of the Republican judges on the court. House Bill 772 allows poll watchers to \u201cmove freely\u201d around polling sites \u2014 standing as close as 5 feet away from voters and poll workers \u2014 and listen and record many activities inside the polling site. The bill writes a number of new powers for poll watchers into law: They can listen to conversations at the polling site, including those that identify voters and their addresses. They can take videos or photos of tabulation equipment at the start and finish of voting, and use their cell phones for note taking and communication, as long as they don\u2019t take calls inside the voting enclosure during voting hours. Senate Bill 747, which also passed the Senate last month, adds a spate of new restrictions to voting, including provisions that: Democrats say the bill includes provisions that would suppress voting, while others are ill-conceived proposals designed to appease base voters who believe former President Donald Trump\u2019s stolen election lie. For example, two-factor authentication is \u201cnonsensical,\u201d said state Sen. Natasha Marcus, a Democrat who opposed the legislation. \u201cWe literally asked them over and over: What does that even mean? That doesn\u2019t make any sense, you should take that out of this bill,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t explain it, but they wouldn\u2019t take it out either.\u201d",

        "title": "Russia halts wartime deal allowing Ukraine to ship grain",
        "content": "LONDON \u2014 Russia halted an unprecedented wartime deal Monday that allows grain to flow from Ukraine to countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where hunger is a growing threat and high food prices have pushed more people into poverty. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced Russia would suspend the Black Sea Grain Initiative until its demands to get its own agricultural shipments to the world are met \u2014 even though the country has been shipping record amounts of wheat and its fertilizers also have been flowing. \u201cWhen the part of the Black Sea deal related to Russia is implemented, Russia will immediately return to the implementation of the deal,\u201d he said. Russia has complained that restrictions on shipping and insurance have hampered its exports of food and fertilizer \u2014 also critical to the global food chain. The suspension marks the end of an accord that the United Nations and Turkey brokered last summer to allow food to leave the Black Sea region after Russia\u2019s invasion of its neighbor worsened a global food crisis. The initiative is credited with helping lower soaring prices of wheat, vegetable oil and other food commodities. Ukraine and Russia are both major global suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other affordable food products on which developing nations rely. The grain deal provided assurances that ships won\u2019t be attacked entering and leaving Ukrainian ports, while a separate agreement facilitated the movement of Russian food and fertilizer. While Western sanctions do not apply to Moscow\u2019s agricultural shipments, some companies may be wary of doing business with Russia because of the measures. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said the suspension was expected and believes it\u2019s political theater. \u201cThe statement itself immediately includes an escape clause,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, we are dealing with classic public techniques of the Russian Federation that no longer require significant reciprocal reactions.\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said the country\u2019s foreign minister would speak with his Russian counterpart Monday \u2014 and that he was hopeful the deal would be extended. The suspension of the deal sent wheat prices up about 3% in Chicago trading, to $6.81 a bushel. Analysts don\u2019t expect more than a temporary bump to food commodity prices because countries such as Russia and Brazil have ratcheted up wheat and corn exports, but food insecurity worldwide is growing. The Black Sea Grain Initiative has allowed three Ukrainian ports to export 32.9 million metric tons of grain and other food to the world, more than half of that to developing nations, according to the joint coordination center in Istanbul. The agreement was renewed for 60 days in May, but in recent months, the amount of food shipped and the number of vessels departing Ukraine have plunged, with Russia accused of preventing additional ships from participating. The war in Ukraine sent food commodity prices to record highs last year and contributed to a global food crisis also tied to other conflicts, the lingering effects of the Covid pandemic, droughts and other climate factors. High costs of grain needed for food staples in countries such as Egypt, Lebanon and Nigeria exacerbated economic challenges and helped push millions more into poverty or food insecurity. Rising food prices affect people in developing countries disproportionately, because they spend more of their money on meals. Under the deal, prices of global food commodities such as wheat and vegetable oil have fallen, but food was already expensive before the war in Ukraine and the relief hasn\u2019t trickled down to kitchen tables. \u201cThe Black Sea deal is absolutely critical for the food security of a number of countries,\u201d and its loss will compound the problems for those facing high debt levels and climate fallout, said Simon Evenett, a professor of international trade and economic development at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said this month that 45 countries need outside food assistance, with high local food prices \u201ca driver of worrying levels of hunger\u201d in those places.",

        "title": "Nicaraguan migrant who died in ICE custody had been recommended for release, advocates say",
        "content": "A Nicaraguan migrant who died in immigration custody last week had been recommended for release by an ICE panel last year but remained detained until his death, advocates said Thursday. Ernesto Rocha-Cuadra, 42, died Friday at a hospital in Jena, Louisiana, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement this week. The preliminary cause of death \u201cwas reported by hospital medical officials to be cardiac arrest,\u201d it said. An ICE panel recommended that Rocha-Cuadra be released in November, a coalition of immigration advocacy groups said in a statement Thursday. The statement said officials at the detention center declined to release him.  \u201cThey kept telling him he was going to be released soon,\u201d Frank Rocha-Cuadra, who is Ernesto\u2019s brother and a U.S. citizen, said in the statement from the Shut Down NOLA ICE Coalition. \u201cHe was guaranteed he was coming home. Our message is, we want to know what happened to our Ernesto and we will not stop until we find out.\u201d The coalition said that according to Rocha-Cuadra\u2019s attorneys, he had been petitioning for his freedom and was scheduled for an immigration hearing July 9.  \u201cErnesto\u2019s untimely death raises many questions that should be investigated at the highest levels. This immigrant prison must be shut down,\u201d Rose Murray, a senior direct services attorney with the Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in the statement. The statement said that while the details of Rocha-Cuadra\u2019s death were still unclear, his attorneys say that he never mentioned having heart-related medical issues and that his medical records did not indicate heart-related medical issues, either. ICE did not immediately respond to request for comment on Rocha-Cuadra\u2019s case and whether he had been recommended for release.  Immigration authorities apprehended Rocha-Cuadra after he crossed the border near Andrade, California, on April 17, 2022, according to ICE. On April 26, 2022, he was transferred to ICE custody as he waited for his immigration case to play out. \u201cICE incarcerated Ernesto for over a year during which he suffered extensive time in solitary confinement,\u201d the immigration advocacy groups\u2019 statement said. Rocha-Cuadra\u2019s immigration counsel, Homero L\u00f3pez, the legal director of the group Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy, said, \u201cHis tragic death after being caged by ICE for more than a year is a reminder of how useless and unnecessary the immigration detention system truly is.\u201d The immigration groups said Rocha-Cuadra was the fifth person to have died in ICE custody at the Jena detention center since 2016 and the 11th during the Biden administration. ICE said in its statement this week that it notified the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General, the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility and the Nicaraguan Consulate General in Miami of Rocha-Cuadra\u2019s death.",

Police and firefighters in Antioch \u2014 a village just south of the Wisconsin border about halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee \u2014 rushed to the Antioch Taste of Summer festival at about 2:40 p.m. Sunday, authorities said. The first responders \"discovered an injured 10-year-old child who appeared to have been thrown from a carnival ride,\" police said in a statement Sunday. The boy was on ride called Moby Dick, which locks people in at the shoulders and then goes up and down as speed increases. Village officials identified the boy Monday as Huntley Daniels. He was first taken to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, but because of the extent of his injuries, he was then airlifted to Comer Children\u2019s Hospital in Chicago, the village said in a statement. He \"suffered multiple facial and jaw fractures and a significant injury to the bones in one leg,\" the statement said. The youngster was set to undergo surgery Monday, Antioch Fire Chief Jon Cokefair told NBC News. \"He has some pretty significant injuries,\" said Cokefair, who estimated the boy's fall to have been 15 to 20 feet. Witness Elliott Johnson told NBC Chicago: \"I saw maybe on the third time around, he almost did a, like, a dive, like his hands were down and his legs were straight off the ride, and [he] landed\" on the pavement.\" Johnson said he also went on the Moby Dick ride and had problems with its safety bar. \"My bar was coming up over my head, so I was trying, every time I went up ... I was almost about to fall out. I would slam [the bar] down to close it,\" he said. Parent Lauren Tardi said she spotted workers not always making sure the safety bars were securely fastened. \"I was concerned, because I could see that when they pulled it down that a couple of kids, a few times, could still put it back up,\" she said. Mayor Scott Gartner consulted with law enforcement, fire and other village officials before he invoked \"his executive authority to order the remainder of the rides\" at the event to be shut down Sunday, police said. Police, fire and state Labor Department investigators are leading the probe. \u201cWe will be working with the Lake County States Attorney to determine if any criminal charges will be appropriate under these circumstances,\u201d Antioch Police Chief Geoffrey Guttschow said in a statement Monday. The ride's equipment and labor were provided by All American Amusement, based in Lockport, Illinois, in a contract with the village's Chamber of Commerce, Antioch officials said. To ride Moby Dick, a passenger must be at least 42 inches tall, according to All American Amusement's website. All American lists the ride's maker as Wisdom Rides of America, with Moby Dick being one version of its Genesis Ride line. Representatives for All American and Wisdom Rides could not immediately be reached for comment Monday.",

        "content": "A mountain biker died Saturday after helping to get emergency crews to a group of hikers who were suffering dehydration in San Diego County. A group of cyclists in Jacumba found four hikers who had no food or water and were experiencing heat exhaustion, Cal Fire Capt. Brent Pascua told NBC San Diego. Two of the cyclists went to the trailhead to meet with emergency crews and give them GPS coordinates to the hikers. \"Once the four hikers were lifted to safety, they required no further treatment,\" Pascua said. \"That's when the last two mountain bikers rode back to the trailhead to meet up with everyone. And somewhere in between there, the last two got separated.\" Emergency crews found one cyclist, who was not identified, about a quarter-mile from the trailhead. The person, who was unresponsive, was carried back to an air-conditioned pickup truck, Pascua said. The cyclist was driven over to where the ambulances were set up on the trail. \"That's where they worked on the patient, tried to provide lifesaving measures, and ultimately the patient was pronounced at 5:45 p.m.,\" Pascua said. Cal Fire's San Diego County division posted Saturday afternoon on Facebook that it was responding to a \"remote area rescue in the area of Carrizo Gorge\" after it received reports that four people were suffering dehydration. The post said six people were treated and released, in addition to two bystanders who were assessed but needed no aid. The San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department closed some trails Saturday because of the extreme heat. The sheriff's department did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the dead cyclist.  Pascua said Cal Fire crews reported temperatures reached nearly 110 degrees Saturday. AccuWeather had the high in Jacumba at 106 degrees, while Weather.com reported the highest temperature in the area Saturday at 103 degrees. Pascua encouraged people to change their plans for outdoor activities when temperatures reach extremes or to at least pack more water than they believe they will need. \"It\u2019s unfortunate this was a good Samaritan just trying to help out. ... Unfortunately, bad things happen to people out there when it\u2019s this hot,\" Pascua said. \"Know your limitations and try and get help as soon as possible. That way we can get out there and help you.\"",

        "title": "Vivek Ramaswamy releases conservative pool of Supreme Court picks",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Borrowing a tactic from former President Donald Trump, 2024 GOP Oval Office hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of conservative potential Supreme Court nominees Monday. The roster includes two senators \u2014 Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Mike Lee, R-Utah \u2014 former Solicitor General Paul Clement and a half-dozen of the nation's most conservative federal appellate court judges. Some of them have worked to limit abortion and transgender rights. Ramaswamy also named seven judges, from various federal district courts, the U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, as a pool from which he would select U.S. circuit court nominees if he is elected. \"We were looking for diversity of vantage points on the Constitution, but without a diversity of commitment to the originalist understanding of the Constitution,\" Ramaswamy said in an interview with NBC News. In May 2016, as Trump locked down the Republican nomination, he thrilled conservatives by announcing his own list of 11 people whom he might name to succeed Antonin Scalia. None of them were Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump actually nominated and who now sits on the high court. Ramaswamy said he may add to his pool later. But for now, it consists of Cruz, Lee, Clement and these six judges: James Ho, Lawrence VanDyke, Lisa Branch, Thomas Hardiman, Justin Walker and John Bush. Ho and Branch have said they won't hire law clerks from Yale and Stanford as retaliation for what they describe as the \"cancel culture\" at those universities. Ramaswamy, a businessman and author, holds a law degree from Yale. A gifted public speaker who rails against \"woke\" Democrats, Ramaswamy has generated modest buzz within Republican circles but typically polls in the low single digits in national surveys of the GOP field. Few issues are as important to Republican primary voters as the composition of the court, and candidates often try to reassure those voters that they will pick conservatives justices. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running second in national polls, recently said the three justices Trump put on the Supreme Court don't meet the \"gold standard.\" \"We'll do better than that,\" DeSantis told radio host Hugh Hewitt. Ramaswamy, whose list includes several Trump appointees, said the former president's nominees have been \"outstanding\" at the Supreme Court and lower federal benches. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a misplaced criticism,\u201d Ramaswamy said. \u201cIt borders on bizarre.\u201d He said his decision to release lists of judges was not originally driven by Trump's use of the maneuver during the 2016 and 2020 campaigns. But by the time he put out his own list Monday, he was well aware that Trump had made similar moves. Ramaswamy's pool for seats on the U.S. circuit courts is also comprised of conservative stalwarts: U.S. district court judges Martha Pacold, Sarah Pitlyk, Kathryn Mizelle, Matthew Kacsmaryk and Brantley Starr, as well as Stephen Alexander Vaden of the U.S. Court of International Trade and Ryan Holte of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.",

        "title": "Russia's Crimea Bridge hit by explosion as Moscow blames Ukraine",
        "content": "Ukrainian naval drones hit a key bridge linking Russia to the annexed Crimean Peninsula, killing a couple and seriously injuring their daughter, the Kremlin said Monday. The bridge, a symbolic and strategically important piece of infrastructure that President Vladimir Putin himself opened in 2018, connects road and rail traffic from Russia to the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014. Pictures from The Associated Press and others showed that part of the roadbed had fallen away, with warped metal girders hanging down toward the water. Russian officials said the bridge was hit by blasts from two Ukrainian \u201cunmanned naval surface vehicles,\u201d the National Antiterrorism Committee said in a statement, adding that it had opened an investigation into what it called a \"terrorist act.\" A man and a woman driving along the bridge were killed and their daughter was seriously injured, it said. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said at a daily briefing that Russia knew \"the reasons\" behind \"this terrorist act\" but did not elaborate further. Both he and the country's foreign ministry made suggestions about Western involvement in the incident, a common talking point in Moscow, without providing evidence. \"If the Western origin of the naval surface drones that attacked the bridge \u2014 as well as the role of Western countries in planning, sponsoring and carrying out this operation \u2014 is revealed, this will confirm their complicity in the terrorist activities of the Kyiv regime,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement. Putin is set to hold a televised meeting about the bridge on Monday evening. Russian officials did not provide evidence of their claims of responsibility. Hours after the attack, Russia halted an unprecedented wartime deal allowing grain to flow from Ukraine to countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Ukraine's public broadcaster, Suspilne, cited multiple anonymous law enforcement sources as saying the bridge explosion was the result of a special operation by Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency and its navy. NBC News has not confirmed the reports. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence spokesperson, Andriy Yusov, declined to comment on whether Ukraine was involved. Speaking with Suspilne, he noted only that \"any logistical problems are additional complications for the occupiers\" \u2014 meaning Russia. Earlier, Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s southern command, suggested Russia could be behind the attack. \"Given the unprecedented security measures that the Russians have been taking for a long time around the Crimean bridge, they most likely controlled this entire situation and it continues to unfold according to the script programmed by them,\" she told Suspilne. In October, Russia blamed Ukraine for another explosion that damaged the bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge. Ukraine admitted only indirectly to the attack months later. Monday's explosions happened at 3:04 a.m. (8:04 p.m. ET Sunday) and 3:20 a.m., according to the Grey Zone, a channel on the messaging app Telegram affiliated with Russia's Wagner mercenary group, according to Reuters. Vladimir Konstantinov, the speaker of the Russia-installed Crimean parliament, said in a statement posted on Telegram that the railroad section of the bridge, which is crucial for Russian military logistics, had not been damaged in the blasts. \"Kyiv could not help but know that the automobile part of the crossing is a purely civilian facility,\" he said. \"But that has never stopped the terrorists. It won\u2019t stop [them] in the future.\" He added that \"regarding the retribution,\" the Russian Defense Ministry \"has promised strikes against the centers where the criminal decisions are made,\" he said. The incident also fired up some of the Kremlin's most hawkish propagandists. Margarita Simonyan, the head of the Russian state broadcaster RT, suggested that if \"British intelligence\" was behind the attack \u2014 something for which she did not provide evidence \u2014 then London's Tower Bridge would \"absolutely\" be a legitimate target. And Vladimir Solovyov, one of the most prolific and outspoken pro-Kremlin voices on Russian state TV, suggested his country should hit back by bombing Ukraine's parliament building and turning the office of its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, into a \"crater.\"",

        "content": "Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz basked Monday in the glow of thrilling victory over the weekend \u2014 but he conceded that he could have easily lost the title match in straight sets. Alcaraz topped Novak Djokovic in five sets Sunday to win the world's most famous tennis tournament in a match he said could have easily gone the other way. Speaking on NBC's \"TODAY\" show, Alcaraz said he was \"really, really glad\" to have won the second set. \u201cIf not, probably I could have lost, you know, in the straight sets,\u201d he said. \u201cI just believe in myself all of the time.\u201d Djokovic dominated the first set before Alcaraz won a thrilling tiebreaker to win the second and set the stage for an epic five-set showdown that lasted almost five hours. Alcaraz said that even as Djokovic dominated the early play, he talked himself into remaining upbeat, knowing his chances to win games and get back into the match would come. Alcaraz, 20, couldn\u2019t be blamed for a momentary case of stage fright, playing on the sport\u2019s most sacred ground, Centre Court of the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club. \"It was a dream come true for me\" just to play for the championship, Alcaraz said. \"It was tough to deal with the nerves facing Novak on that stage.\" The audience Sunday included Kate, Princess of Wales; Prince William; their two oldest children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte; and King Felipe VI of Spain.  Alcaraz said he caught a glimpse of Felipe shouting an encouraging \"vamos\" after he won points. \"I was not thinking about it. I tried not to think about it,\" he said. \"But sometimes it's difficult to stay away from that. It's your own Spanish king watching you, supporting you.\u201d Alcaraz became the youngest men's champ since 17-year-old Boris Becker won it in 1985. Djokovic, 36, has won seven men's singles titles and is still one short of the record eight championships of the recently retired Roger Federer. Both Alcaraz and Djokovic are expected to play in the U.S. Open this year.",

        "title": "In \u2018warfare against renters,\u2019 homeowners fight affordable housing push",
        "content": "At a packed City Hall meeting, one resident after another stood before the City Council of the suburban Phoenix city of Surprise pleading with officials to block the construction of an apartment complex for seniors and lower-income renters \u2014 shouting, heckling and arguing about crime and traffic congestion.   In the crowd was Nate Pomeroy, a leader in the effort to block the apartment complex. He moved to Surprise in 2018 from Scottsdale after years in California to retire and expected it would be the last home he\u2019d live in. Now, he\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll stay. He worries the apartment complex will increase traffic and change the character of the area, which is made up of sprawling subdivisions of Spanish-style homes selling for $500,000 to $700,000.   The heated debate in Surprise, population 150,000, is being echoed in large and small communities across the country as local officials have pushed to increase the housing supply with small backyard bungalows to subsidized apartment complexes in response to surging rents and home prices since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.   \u201cIt\u2019s just going to turn this into a very high-density area. It\u2019s going to really change the look and feel of where we are, and people aren\u2019t happy about it,\u201d Pomeroy said. \u201cThe City Council and city management have not listened effectively. They\u2019re going to build and build and build, and it\u2019s no longer going to be the last place I live.\u201d Vocal groups of homeowners say they are fearful of what the changes could mean for their communities. Increasingly, they are fighting back with lawsuits, referendums, appeals to state representatives and recall elections in a battle to stave off multifamily housing in their largely suburban neighborhoods. \u201cIt\u2019s the same buzzwords no matter where you are. Some are more veiled than others as far as whether they will flat-out say that renters are second-class citizens,\u201d said Owen Metz, a senior vice president at Dominium, an affordable housing developer that is working on the proposed apartment complex in Surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s not everywhere, but there seems to be this growing warfare against renters.\u201d Homeowners have long put up fights against new developments \u2014 the acronym NIMBY, or \"not in my backyard,\" has been in use for decades \u2014 but the battles have grown louder in recent years amid a wave of apartment construction stretching outside of city centers. The debates have also taken on new urgency as surging home prices drive out middle-class workers and lead to an uptick in homelessness, affordable housing advocates said.  For the past 15 years, the rate at which new homes and apartments are being built has failed to keep up with the demand, in part because of the lingering effects of the 2008 housing market crash, said Jeff Tucker, a senior economist at Zillow, which estimates the U.S. has a shortage of more than 4 million homes. Awais Azhar, a housing advocate in Austin, Texas, who is a member of the city\u2019s Planning Commission, said: \u201cThat cost pressure that was being felt by coastal cities has now traveled to our suburbs. It\u2019s traveled to our rural areas. Affordability is truly a United States crisis. There is a lot of pressure and angst from local advocates and leaders, because while unaffordability has been an issue for a while, we\u2019ve just never seen this level of crisis in the way we\u2019re seeing it now.\u201d The housing shortage was aggravated during the pandemic when remote work and the desire for more space led to a population shift toward less densely packed suburban areas and relatively lower-cost states, like Texas, Arizona and Colorado. In turn, home prices have risen more than 30% and rents are up more than 25% nationwide since 2020. The Phoenix area has experienced some of the biggest housing cost increases in the country, with rents up 41% since the start of 2020 and home prices up more than 50%, according to Zillow. At the same time, homelessness in the region has increased 36%. In Surprise, an outer-lying suburb of Phoenix backed up against the desert, residents have been fighting the city and the developer for more than a year, first with an attempt to get the project on the election ballot and then in court. At the center of the fight are 388 apartments for people with incomes up to $39,300 for individuals and $56,100 for families of four with rents that would range from $1,052 for one bedroom to $1,458 for three bedrooms. The proposed development, on what was once a ranch, would also include 211 units of housing for seniors.  City officials supporting the development said it could help provide housing to workers essential to the community, like teachers making an average salary of $42,000. The project would be financed by a federal low-income housing tax credit that would offset some of the costs and enable the developer to offer below-market rents. Unlike government-owned and -operated public housing projects built for lower-income residents decades ago, the vast majority of affordable housing built today is owned and managed by private developers using the tax credit.  Pomeroy said he understands the need for more affordable housing in Surprise and knows more development is inevitable in his neighborhood. But he doesn\u2019t believe the project fits with the \u201clook and feel\u201d of the area and questions whether there is the road and water infrastructure to handle that many new residents. \u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily against affordable housing. We get this is politically very unpopular, because as soon as you talk about that the liberal locals, the media, etc., will label us as NIMBYs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo now all of a sudden we\u2019re back on our heels going \u2018Wait a minute, we\u2019re not bad people,\u2019 and then they just shout you down and all that garbage.\u201d Homeowners are mounting opposition not just to housing that would provide below-market rents but to any attempt by city officials and developers to increase housing supply by building multifamily projects, whether they are large apartment complexes or smaller duplexes, in areas now dominated by single-family homes. In Austin, residents sued to block the city from updating its land code to allow for more apartment buildings and multifamily projects \u2014 significantly slowing down a much-needed increase to the city's housing supply, Azhar said. Average rents in the Austin area have increased 28% and the sale price of a home has increased nearly 50% since the start of 2020, according to data from Zillow.  In Colorado, an effort by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis to spur creation of more multifamily housing units statewide failed this year, and residents have continued to push back at the local level. In the Denver suburb of Englewood, residents are seeking to recall the mayor and several City Council members over their support for more multifamily housing, including changes that would allow people to build smaller homes on their properties called accessory dwelling units, said Kurt Suppes, who is organizing the recall. \u201cAll these people that bought these homes all these years ago are now suddenly facing huge changes in their neighborhoods and the potential loss of a whole lot of the equity that they have in their homes,\u201d said Suppes, who has lived in his home in Englewood for 40 years. \u201cNobody is going to want to buy your house except the developers.\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul recently backed off a statewide strategy to build 800,000 homes over the next decade that would have included increasing development in New York City\u2019s suburbs after swift bipartisan opposition from members of the state Legislature.  The debate has also been playing out in Washington. President Joe Biden has urged the construction of more affordable housing, having released a plan last year to provide incentives for states and cities to build hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units over the next three years. That\u2019s in contrast with former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly warned while he was in office that Democrats would destroy the suburbs with low-income housing that would bring crime and reduce home values. The resistance from homeowners and elected officials has caused developers to abandon projects and slowed construction, in some cases adding a year or more to projects\u2019 timelines, said Dan Klocke, a project development manager with the affordable housing builder Gorman & Co. It has also caused developers to avoid undertaking projects in some cities that have mounted past opposition, he said.  \u201cThe risks are high. All of that added time for not just one project but for hundreds of projects slows down the amount of housing that you build over time in your state,\u201d Klocke said. \"When you continue to do that in project after project, you build far fewer housing units, and it\u2019s basic supply and demand. The less supply, the higher the demand, the higher the price. Then, there goes your affordability.\u201d While residents have so far been unable to stop the development in Surprise, opposition from residents and a lack of support from city officials in nearby Buckeye contributed to the same developer\u2019s decision to cancel plans to build 300 subsidized apartment units in the city, Metz said.  Local officials said they saw an unprecedented level of opposition from residents, who raised fears about crime to water shortages. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have gotten more complaints about a specific project than that project. Our inboxes were just full,\u201d Mayor Eric Orsborn said. Like Surprise, Buckeye sits at the edge of the desert in the outer ring of metropolitan Phoenix, and its population has ballooned, too. In 2000, it had just 6,500 residents, half of them inmates at the local prison, and it now has a population of more than 100,000, Orsborn said.  But more large-scale housing projects are inevitable for the community given the pace of growth, and they are something residents are going to have to learn to accept, Buckeye City Council member Clay Goodman said.  \u201cYou can\u2019t shut the door after you get here,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of growth that\u2019s coming, and as a council, we\u2019re trying to do it the right way.\u201d",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The now-husband of a Jan. 6 defendant who was identified by her ex after the FBI posted viral images of her wearing a pink beret during the Capitol attack has also been charged with federal crimes. Spencer Geller, the husband of \"Pink Beret,\" now identified by the FBI as Jennifer Inzunza Vargas Geller, faces a felony count of obstructing, impeding or interfering with officers during civil disorder, along with misdemeanor charges. The couple were in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021, and split up once they got to the Capitol. Vargas Geller ended up inside, while Geller, her husband, remained outside and was at the location of some of the most violent scenes of the day. As NBC News first reported, \"Pink Beret\" has long been a subject of interest to online \"Sedition Hunters\" who have aided in hundreds of Jan. 6 cases and who have identified hundreds of additional Capitol rioters who have not been arrested. But it was not until the FBI tweeted images of \"Pink Beret\" in April that her photos went viral and were seen by an ex, who was standing in line at a Joann Fabric and Crafts store when his buddy showed him the FBI tweet on his phone. \u201cI stopped dead in my tracks,\u201d the ex said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s Jenny.\u2019\u201d The ex reported Vargas Geller to the FBI, and she was charged with several misdemeanors on May 8. But she was not arrested because she was out of the country. The FBI affidavit in her husband's case indicates that a tipster believed the couple were traveling in Japan, and online sleuths have surfaced numerous photos and videos of the couple, who appear to be living in Asia with a baby. On Jan. 6, Geller \u201cwas one of the first individuals to arrive at the West Plaza,\" the FBI affidavit says, and he can be seen on video \"pushing bike racks\" during the initial breach of the barricade around the Capitol. He eventually made his way up to the entrance to the lower west tunnel, where some of the most violent scenes took place, according to the FBI affidavit. The FBI first posted images of \"Pink Beret\" after a defense lawyer for another Jan. 6 defendant suggested that the woman was a \"femme fatale\" government operative who lured defendants into the Capitol. No lawyer was listed for Geller who could be asked to comment.",

        "title": "Biden speaks with Netanyahu as White House prepares for Herzog meeting",
        "content": "President Joe Biden spoke Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and invited him to the U.S. for a meeting in the coming months. \u201cThe Prime Minister responded positively to the invitation and it was agreed that the Israeli and U.S. teams would coordinate the details of the meeting,\u201d the Israeli government said in a statement. The two leaders discussed strengthening the U.S.-Israel alliance, threats from Iran and \u201cthe continuation of efforts for calm and stability in Judea and Samaria,\u201d the Israeli statement said. Israel also characterized the conversation as \u201cwarm and long.\u201d John Kirby, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said Biden underscored his \"ironclad\" commitment to Israel's security. In addition to discussing Iran, the two leaders also talked about judicial reforms in Israel and Biden's concern about settlement growth, Kirby said at a White House briefing. He added that they would meet in the fall. In a summary of the call, the White House said that Biden \"expressed concern about continued settlement growth and called on all parties to refrain from further unilateral measures\" and that he reiterated \"the need for the broadest possible consensus\" in the debate in Israel over judicial reforms. \"As friends can and friends should, you speak honestly, openly, forthrightly, candidly. You lay it out there, and President Biden has done that,\" Kirby said. \"He's done it publicly with respect to judicial reforms, and he'll continue to do it in his conversations with Israeli leaders.\" Kirby said the two leaders had been trying to schedule the call for \"some weeks.\" Biden and Netanyahu last spoke in March. Netanyahu was rushed to the hospital over the weekend after he experienced \u201cmild dizziness,\u201d his office said. The director of the hospital\u2019s cardiology unit said the hospitalization was due to dehydration. Netanyahu was discharged Sunday after he was fitted with a heart monitor. U.S. and Israeli relations have been tense in recent months after Biden criticized a judicial overhaul that Netanyahu had undertaken despite domestic protests. Biden had faced criticism for not yet having invited Netanyahu to visit the White House since Netanyahu returned to power. Biden is set to meet Tuesday with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial position, at the White House. The contents of Monday's call reflect a similar agenda that the White House put out for the meeting with Herzog on Tuesday. Biden and Herzog plan to discuss ways to advance freedom and security for Israelis and Palestinians, address Iran's \"destabilizing behavior\" and \"deepen Israel\u2019s regional integration,\" according to the White House. Netanyahu, a far-right politician, is in his sixth term in office. His government has moved to expand Israeli settlements in the West Bank, to the consternation of the U.S. and other countries. In March, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman protested to Israel's ambassador to the U.S. about changes in Israeli law that would allow new settlement construction in the West Bank. Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The corruption trial has been ongoing since 2020.",

        "content": "A 12-year-old girl has been charged in connection with what officials say was an acid attack on another girl on a Detroit playground this month. The 12-year-old girl is scheduled to be in court Tuesday afternoon on one count each of assault with intent to do great bodily harm and felonious assault, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym L. Worthy said in a news release. Worthy's office said the girl was released on a $10,000 bond \"with a tether\" Saturday. She was not publicly identified by authorities, and her case will be heard in the court's Juvenile Referee Department. The girl's family have not identified themselves, and it is unclear whether they have an attorney. \u201cThis is an extremely troubling set of allegations,\" Worthy said. \"Instant horrible-decision making can have lifelong effects on others. There is no excuse for this.\" The family of Deaira Summers, the 11-year-old girl who was doused with the acid, told NBC affiliate WDIV that the attack happened July 9 while Deaira and her cousins were playing at Vernor Elementary School. The 12-year-old was involved in an argument with Deaira's cousin. \u201cIt is going to scar her for life,\u201d said Domonique Summers, Deaira's mother. \u201cIt was a traumatizing event that took place, and she\u2019s going to remember this the rest of her life.\u201d After the argument, Deaira and her siblings left the park, but Deaira went back for her purse, and the acid was thrown on her, according to the family's GoFundMe campaign. She suffered second- and third-degree burns on her back, arms and legs. She spent four days in the burn unit at the hospital, the medical fundraiser said. Deaira showed WDIV her injuries, saying she screamed and cried after the unknown liquid was thrown on her. \"At first, it didn't feel like it,\" Deaira said. \"But then, like, two seconds later, it started burning and went through my shirt, my shorts.\" Detroit police did not immediately respond to a request for more information Monday.",

        "title": "A determined mom and a veteran police officer who said this is 'solvable' revived the Gilgo Beach probe",
        "content": "The bodies were found more than a decade ago on a windswept spit of Long Island sand near Gilgo Beach, where the only sounds during the off-season are the screeching of seagulls and waves pounding the shore. There were 11 victims, all but two young women who had been working as sex workers when they vanished. But the mystery of what might have happened to at least four of the women would not be revealed until Friday when a 59-year-old architect named Rex Heuermann, who had been living quietly in the Nassau County town of Massapequa Park and commuting regularly to his office in Manhattan, appeared before a Long Island judge to face murder charges in the deaths of three of the women. Through his attorney, Heuermann pleaded not guilty. He remains a suspect in the disappearance and death of the fourth woman. Until last year, investigators had been wrestling with the seemingly unsolvable crimes as they searched for a predator with a predilection for petite female sex workers with hazel or green eyes. The fact that a 2-year-old girl and a young Asian man were also found at Gilgo Beach in 2010 and 2011 only deepened the mystery and widened the investigation. But last year, Suffolk County\u2019s new police commissioner, a former high-ranking New York Police Department veteran named Rodney Harrison, took over the dormant search and formed what The New York Daily News called a \u201cdream team of detectives\u201d to track down the killer. \u201cI believe this case is solvable and identifying the person or people responsible for these murders is a top priority,\u201d Harrison declared in February 2022. The Gilgo Beach Homicide Investigation Task Force marked the first time local, state and federal officials combined forces to track down a suspected serial killer, Suffolk County officials said. The effort culminated Thursday in Heuermann\u2019s arrest at his Manhattan office. \u201cWe\u2019ll all be sleeping a lot easier tonight,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Friday shortly before Heuermann appeared in court. But the case was marked from the start by apparent missteps and accusations that investigators were dragging their feet because of a cultural bias against sex workers. Melissa Cann, whose 20-year-old sister, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, vanished in July 2007, described in a New York Magazine interview what happened when she told a police officer her sister was missing and that she was a sex worker. \u201cSoon as I told him what she was doing up in Manhattan, it was like he didn\u2019t care,\u201d Cann said.  The struggle to get the wheels of justice moving inspired a Netflix movie in 2020 called \u201cLost Girls\u201d about Mari Gilbert\u2019s effort to find her 24-year-old daughter, Shannan Gilbert, a sex worker from New Jersey who vanished in May 2010 and whose body was later found on Gilgo Beach. Mari Gilbert was stabbed to death in July 2016 by one of her other daughters, Sarra, who suffered from schizophrenia.  Suffolk County investigators \u201cdropped the ball from the beginning,\u201d Shannan Gilbert\u2019s sister, Sherre, said in a May 2022 interview with NBC News. Brainard-Barnes was the first woman to be reported missing, but the investigation did not pick up steam until December 2010, when a team of Suffolk County investigators spurred by Mari Gilbert went out to Gilgo Beach to search for her daughter. A veteran Suffolk County Police Department officer named John Mallia and his search dog, Blue, came across \u201ca set of human remains,\u201d according to a document released Friday in which investigators laid out their arguments for why Heuermann should be denied bail. The remains were later identified as those of 24-year-old Melissa Barthelemy, who was last seen alive in July 2009.  The remains of Brainard-Barnes, Megan Waterman, 22, and Amber Lynn Costello, 27, were found days later wrapped in burlap sacks as were Barthelemy's. \u201cThe cause of all four women was determined to be homicidal violence,\u201d the bail application stated. Prosecutors also said in the document that Heuermann used burner phones and multiple email accounts to search for sites depicting sexual violence, to reach sex workers and to keep up with the investigation of the murders. He used fictitious names for email accounts and phones \u201cto conduct thousands of searches related to sex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography,\u201d according to the document. Search terms often focused on violent sexual acts involving underage girls. Barthelemy\u2019s burner phone was used to make \"taunting phone calls\" to her family members in the days after her disappearance in which a male voice admitted to killing and sexually assaulting Barthelemy, according to the bail document. The calls were later traced to a location near Heuermann's office. Heuermann was in part identified as a suspect by DNA left on pizza crust he threw out in a Manhattan trash can when a hair found on Waterman's body was matched with DNA found on the crust. Heuermann was charged Friday in the deaths of Barthelemy, Waterman and Costello but not Brainard-Barnes or Shannan Gilbert. Thanks to the persistence of her sister, Shannan Gilbert's terrifying last words would become her epitaph. On May 1, 2010, at 4:51 a.m., Gilbert made a 22-minute 911 call shortly after a date with a customer named John Brewer in Oak Beach on Long Island that was followed by two more shorter calls to the dispatcher for help, police said. Brewer has admitted seeing Shannan Gilbert that night but has not been implicated in her death, police said. While Shannan Gilbert\u2019s calls were hard to follow at times and some words sounded slurred, the message police said she repeated was, \u201cSomebody\u2019s after me! There\u2019s somebody after me! There\u2019s somebody after me!\u201d Those 911 recordings were not released by investigators until May 2020 when Suffolk County officials continued to insist Shannan Gilbert was the victim of a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and may have been using drugs or succumbed to the elements after she reached the beach and got disoriented. They continued to maintain Shannan Gilbert was not the victim of a crime even after Michael Baden, the world-famous pathologist who reported that George Floyd died as a result of a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on his neck, did an autopsy and concluded the young woman could have been strangled. \u201cI don\u2019t care if anybody thinks she was on drugs, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Sherre Gilbert said in May 2022. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t believe she would run in a drug-induced paranoia and just strip her clothes all the way off, throw her phone down with her clothes and then just keep running naked into the marsh. I just don\u2019t believe that.\u201d",

        "title": "Rep. Lauren Boebert won by only 546 votes last year. She isn\u2019t changing her ways.",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Far-right Rep. Lauren Boebert eked out the narrowest of victories in Republican-friendly territory last fall, defeating Democrat Adam Frisch by only 546 votes and stunning political watchers who hadn\u2019t had the sleepy Colorado race on their radar.  Frisch is now seeking a rematch \u2014 and Boebert, a conservative firebrand and culture warrior, hasn\u2019t moderated her policy positions or toned down her rhetoric in her second term on Capitol Hill. Instead, Boebert has been attracting national headlines for taking on President Joe Biden \u2014 and her own GOP leadership. In January, she and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., nearly derailed GOP leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s bid to become speaker in a dramatic standoff on the House floor. She accidentally missed the biggest vote of the year \u2014 a vote to raise the debt ceiling that she had opposed. Last month, she infuriated GOP leaders and colleagues by trying to force a floor vote on impeaching President Joe Biden over border issues before House investigations into him had wrapped up. Now, she\u2019s picking a fight over must-pass government funding and military policy bills, demanding they include right-wing policies to win her vote. \u201cA lot of Republicans have been bewildered by her,\u201d said Dick Wadhams, the former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party from 2007 to 2011. \u201cShe has not changed her operating style, either substantively or just generally.\u201d One House GOP lawmaker, who knows Boebert well, offered this advice: \u201cHer ass needs to get home to go campaign. Cut ribbons, go to bar mitzvahs and take credit for stuff she had absolutely nothing to do with.\u201d In a part of Colorado that leans conservative but is accustomed to electing pragmatic Republicans and Democrats who tend to focus on local issues like water, natural resources and agriculture, Boebert stands out in the wrong ways to a segment of voters, Wadhams said. \u201cThe perception, whether it\u2019s fair or not, is that Congresswoman Boebert has paid more attention to fighting these battles within the Republican Party than she has paid attention to the district,\u201d the former Colorado GOP leader said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m sure her office would refute that. The trouble is it gets obscured by how she conducts herself. And that\u2019s what she\u2019s battling right now.\u201d Asked if she planned to change her approach this cycle, Boebert blamed her close call in 2022 on \u201cballot harvesting\u201d \u2014 a GOP term for third-party collection of absentee ballots \u2014 rather than what Democrats have called her \u201cMAGA extremism\u201d and political charades. \u201cWe need to get voter turnout. I think that all Republicans need to focus on ballot harvesting where it\u2019s legal in Colorado. And, I mean, that\u2019s something that we have to pay attention to or we\u2019re going to continue to be in the mess that we\u2019re in,\u201d Boebert said in an interview as she descended the Capitol steps. \u201cDemocrats chase ballots while we\u2019re chasing voters. And so, I mean, we have to get in the game.\u201d But Boebert also said she\u2019s focused on \u201cdelivering\u201d for Colorado\u2019s sprawling 3rd District that includes rural areas, the cities of Grand Junction and Pueblo, and wealthy ski resorts around Aspen. While she didn\u2019t provide specifics \u2014 and her office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment \u2014 some recent press releases have focused on local issues, like her water payments bill getting a hearing, her bill to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list passing out of committee and securing a $5 million grant for a rural health center in a spending package she voted against. \u201cIn the previous Congress, I wasn\u2019t able to do that as much because we were in the minority,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we have a wonderful advantage of having this majority where I can actually deliver wins for my district.\u201d Once the owner of the gun-themed restaurant Shooters Grill, Boebert, 36, has amassed millions of followers on social media, and a substantial platform outside Congress on conservative podcasts and TV shows, and at political conventions. Democrats, and even some Republicans, say her rising national profile has eclipsed any purported local victories. Boebert has recently grabbed headlines after another conservative hero, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, called her colleague a \u201clittle b----\u201d on the House floor \u2014 an altercation that led to Greene\u2019s ouster from the far-right Freedom Caucus. While Greene has now aligned herself with McCarthy, Boebert remains a thorn in his side. \u201cPeople want the circus to stop,\u201d said Frisch, accusing Boebert of pursuing \u201call sorts of wild goose chases and causing all sorts of drama\u201d that don\u2019t matter to the district. \u201cShe\u2019s one of these people that continues to love to get on Twitter and cable news networks and yell and scream.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not focused on the district, she\u2019s focused on herself,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll hammer her away on that.\" In a phone interview, Frisch said he had needed just \u201ctwo more weeks with only gas station money\u201d to win the 2022 race. Now, he says, he\u2019ll have the time and resources he needs to close the deal. Frisch raised an eye-popping $2.6 million to Boebert\u2019s roughly $818,000 in the second quarter; he reported having $2.5 million cash on hand to Boebert's $1.4 million, according to campaign reports. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to be taking the job any more seriously than she was before. And again, that\u2019s bad for the district and bad for the country,\u201d Frisch said. He promised that if he\u2019s elected his focus would be on local matters like water, rural health care, rural education, farming, ranching and natural resources. But the Democrat still faces an uphill climb in the Republican-friendly district, which former President Donald Trump carried by 8 percentage points in 2020, according to data tracked by Daily Kos. But Frisch, 55, said the 2022 result shows he appeals to nominal Republicans, including Trump voters, calling himself a \u201cvery conservative Democrat running against an extremist.\u201d He wants to join the centrist Problem Solvers Caucus and be one of the five most bipartisan members of Congress. He said he disagrees with his party on energy policy, seeing a larger role for oil and gas alongside clean energy (although he said he\u2019d have voted for the Inflation Reduction Act). And he wouldn\u2019t say whether he\u2019s supporting Biden\u2019s re-election bid in 2024. \u201cI share the concern that the majority of people have that it\u2019s a little disappointing that we\u2019re left with kind of a redo of 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m laser-focused on what happens in CD-3.\u201d The National Republican Congressional Committee, however, is eager to paint Frisch, a former Aspen City Council member, as too liberal for the district. \u201cAdam Frisch is a liberal hack traveling around the district spreading lies like a snake oil salesman. Coloradans see through his act,\u201d said NRCC Regional Press Secretary Delanie Bomar. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a Frisch supporter this cycle and last, acknowledged that Boebert \u2014 with millions of social media followers on the right \u2014 can raise campaign cash off things like her Biden impeachment push. But he pointed out that Boebert voted no on Biden\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure law, which is expected to deliver billions in funding for the Centennial State and will be a major focus of Democratic campaigns next year.   \u201cThere are those who can monetize extremism, monetize selfish politics. And she might do that to some degree, but that only carries you so far when you\u2019re literally not submitting funding requests for roads and bridges and water infrastructure,\u201d Crow said. \u201cYou can only hide that for so long. And clearly last cycle, the jig was up. The jig is even more up now.\u201d Democrats will put a premium on knocking Boebert out of Congress, Wadhams warned, which could force the national GOP to spend money to step in and rescue her. \u201cShe\u2019s become kind of a national symbol of what they want to beat,\u201d Wadhams said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a knock-down, drag-out fight between these two. It\u2019s not gonna be pretty. And it\u2019s gonna go down to the wire.\"",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres plans to introduce a resolution Monday to censure embattled Republican New York Rep. George Santos for his misleading comments about his education, work history and family background during his successful campaign for Congress in 2022, a spokesperson said. The resolution from Torres, also of New York, will be privileged, meaning the Republican-controlled House must act on it. Once Torres calls for a vote on the measure, it must be voted on or \"tabled\" (effectively killing it) within 48 hours. The resolution comes after Santos' indictment by federal prosecutors and as the House Ethics Committee's investigation into him drags on. Democrats are anxious to deliver some sort of penalty to Santos before the August recess. Torres spokesperson Jacob Long said the hope is that the resolution could be brought for a vote before members leave Washington at the end of July \u2014 unless the House Ethics Committee concludes its investigation into Santos and reveals its recommendation before then. The New York Times first reported on Torres\u2019 plans to introduce the resolution. Democrats had introduced another privileged resolution in May to expel Santos from the chamber, but Republicans successfully referred the matter to the ethics committee. New York Republicans who have criticized Santos and called for his resignation supported the referral with the understanding that the panel would act within 60 days, by Monday. Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., who represents the neighboring district to Santos, said at the time that he would have \"preferred there to be enough votes to expel the sociopath scam artist,\" but that he believed the ethics committee to act \"within 60 days and for the terrible liar to be gone, by resignation or expulsion, before August recess.\" The ethics committee declined to comment. Santos has pleaded not guilty to the 13 federal counts against him, including wire fraud and money laundering. A trial date has not been set. His next court hearing is scheduled for Sept. 7. Censure votes are rare in Congress but do not carry a serious penalty other than the stain of the censure on a member\u2019s record. House Republicans recently censured Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for his role in the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. Democrats were very critical of the vote at the time and Schiff has raised millions since then. While an expulsion vote requires two-thirds of the House in order to be successful, a censure vote only requires a simple majority. In a statement to NBC News, Santos hammered the Democrats' attempts to introduce the censure resolution. \u201cDemocrats on the other side of the aisle have completely lost focus on the work they should be doing,\" he said. \"My record proves that my office is hard at work, serving constituents and crafting keen legislation. The Republican majority is also working hard to get the country back on track and clean up the mess left behind by destructive one-party Democrat rule. It is time to stop the political ping-pong and get real work done.\" CORRECTION (July 17, 2023, 3:59 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the year of Santos\u2019 successful congressional campaign. It was 2022, not 2020.",

The FBI Violent Crime Task Force dubbed the suspect the \u201cSticky Note Bandit\u201d and is offering a $5,000 reward for any information leading to his capture. The agency tweeted photos of the suspect dressed in a green sweater, black wig, black skirt, black ballet flats, a blue medical mask and black sunglasses caught on surveillance in multiple bank lobbies. The FBI described him as a Black male, approximately 5-foot-8 with a thin to medium build. The first robbery occurred at 1:30 p.m. on July 5 at Hancock Whitney Bank in Houston when the suspect entered dressed as a female, handed a threatening sticky note demanding cash to the teller, and then left on foot with an undisclosed amount of money, the FBI said. No one was injured. He struck again at 12:09 p.m. on July 11 at a Wells Fargo Bank location in Houston, the FBI said. The suspect did not leave with any money after the teller walked away from the counter and locked themselves in the back room. The suspect stayed in the bank lobby for a short time before exiting the building, the FBI said. The third robbery occurred at approximately 3:30 p.m. on July 13 at another Wells Fargo Bank location in Houston and also involved the suspect handing a threatening sticky note to a teller. The robber left the bank on foot with an undisclosed amount of money, the FBI said. Anyone with information can call the Crime Stoppers tip line at 713-222-TIPS (8477) or the FBI Houston Field Office at 713-693-5000.",

        "content": "A sunken tugboat in northern Alabama released thousands of gallons of diesel fuel into the Tennessee River over the weekend, prompting evacuations of beaches and warnings to stay out of the water.  The Florence, Alabama, police department said in a warning Sunday that 3,000 to 5,000 gallons of diesel were released into the river and fuel had begun to wash up on the beaches of McFarland Park. \u201cOfficers are currently at McFarland getting people out of the water that are swimming,\u201d the department said. \u201cPlease stay out of the water and off the beaches until further notice.\u201d Officials had received a report that the tugboat sunk Sunday morning. It\u2019s not clear what caused the boat to sink, George M. Grabryan, emergency management 911 director for the city of Florence and Lauderdale County, Alabama, said Monday. He said no one was on board the tugboat at the time and no injuries or deaths have been reported in connection with the incident. Grabryan said he expects that officials will learn sometime this week what caused the boat to sink. Officials have also been in contact with the Florence company that operates the tugboat. In the meantime, an extensive cleanup process is ongoing by multiple agencies including the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, the Florence fire department and Florence Police Department, and the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency Marine Patrol. Grabryan said boom, which he described as \"a long section of absorbent material,\" has been applied \"across the inference to the port\" and around the tugboat. He explained the boom will \"help contain the diesel on the surface\" of the water and \"keep everything in a pile, hopefully\" to prevent it from spreading. It\u2019s not clear when all the diesel may be cleaned up.  On Monday, officials will work with the Coast Guard to develop a plan to raise the sunken vessel.  \"There\u2019s a crane that\u2019ll be on site today, hopefully to actually assist in raising that vessel,\" Grabryan said. \"We\u2019re fortunate that we do not have these things happen that often. But they\u2019re bringing the right people in here. So we feel really good about that,\" Grabryan said.",

        "title": "Blinken urges Senate to confirm stalled diplomatic nominees",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Antony Blinken is urging the Senate to confirm more than 60 State Department nominees who have been blocked by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., while he seeks information from the administration about the origins of Covid-19. \u201cI am again asking for your leadership to swiftly confirm State Department nominees on the floor,\u201d Blinken wrote in a letter Monday obtained by NBC News. \u201cIf you are holding one or more nominees, I respectfully ask that you reconsider or work with the Department to find a reasonable and expedited path forward.\" \"Our foreign policy and national security interests are depending on it,\u201d Blinken added. Last month, Paul blocked all State Department nominees from clearing Senate confirmation, citing his long-standing request that the department release additional information about the origins of Covid and related government-funded research. Sixty-two diplomatic nominees are awaiting Senate confirmation, including 38 nominated for ambassador positions. All but three of the ambassadorial nominees are career foreign service workers, and some of their appointments have languished in the Senate for more than 18 months, Blinken told reporters Monday. \u201cBy the end of the summer, we expect Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon will all be without confirmed U.S. ambassadors,\u201d Blinken said, also citing vacant ambassadorial posts in Asia, Europe and Latin America. Such postings, Blinken said, were once routinely confirmed through unanimous consent, an arcane rule that allows the Senate to quickly consider requests without a lengthy argument process. If a single senator objects, however, a request is denied. Blinken said America\u2019s adversaries who seize on apparent U.S. weakness could benefit from the blockade of nonpartisan diplomats. The nominees \"represent our most seasoned diplomats,\" and \"their talents are the products of generations of investment by American taxpayers to defend U.S. national security, to sustain and strengthen our alliances and partnerships around the world [and] to ensure that our foreign policy is advancing the interests of the American people,\" Blinken said at Monday's news conference. \"It strains credulity that some of the members of Congress calling most loudly on outcompeting our rivals but at the same time [are] tying our hands behind our back,\" Blinken said. \"We cannot and we must not let this become the new normal.\" A spokesperson said Rand previously made the Foreign Relations Committee aware of his intention to oppose \"all nominees and legislation\" unless the committee's Democratic chair \"stopped obstructing oversight efforts.\" Paul, the spokesperson said in a statement, is \u201csimply trying to access COVID-19 documents being held by various government agencies that are under the jurisdiction of the foreign relations committee.\u201d The spokesperson made no mention of Blinken's accusation that Paul's block harms national security. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller, responding to Paul's statement, told reporters Monday that the agency is cooperating with Paul and said it would continue to \"provide documents that are responsive to his request.\" Paul, however, \"is asking us for documents that are not State Department documents,\" Miller said, and he \u201cshouldn\u2019t be holding our nominees hostage.\u201d \"All that does is hurt our national security,\" Miller said. Another Republican senator, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, has separately blocked hundreds of military promotions, citing his objection to a Defense Department policy that provides paid time off and reimburses travel costs for service members and dependents seeking abortions. Military promotions are usually approved without delay, and President Joe Biden denounced Tuberville's blockade as \"totally irresponsible\" Thursday. Blinken, responding to a reporter's question Monday, said the State Department is in \"close contact\" with the Pentagon over the stalled military appointments. \"That, too, is absolutely detrimental to our national security,\" he said.",

        "title": "Iowa judge temporarily blocks 6-week abortion ban",
        "content": "An Iowa judge on Monday temporarily blocked a new six-week abortion ban from remaining in effect. Polk County District Judge Joseph Seidlin\u2019s order means the law \u2014 which Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law Friday \u2014 will remain on hold while the legal challenge plays out in the court system. \"The court will grant the temporary injunction requested here. In doing so, it recognizes that there are good, honorable and intelligent people \u2014 morally, politically and legally \u2014 on both sides of this upsetting societal and constitutional dilemma. Patience and perseverance are also hallmark traits on both sides, traits that continue to deserve respect,\" Seidlin wrote. \"The court believes it must follow current Iowa Supreme Court precedent and preserve the status quo ante while this litigation\" moves forward, he added. Reynolds signed the ban at a prominent political gathering hosted by an evangelical Christian group. She told attendees, including several Republican presidential candidates, that it represented \u201can ironclad commitment to the smallest and most vulnerable among us.\u201d \"The abortion industry\u2019s attempt to thwart the will of Iowans and the voices of their elected representatives continues today, but I will fight this all the way to the Iowa Supreme Court where we expect a decision that will finally provide justice for the unborn,\" Reynolds said in a statement Monday in response to the injunction. The law went into effect the moment Reynolds signed the bill, but it was frozen by the temporary injunction Monday afternoon. With the law blocked for the time being, abortion restrictions in the state will revert to the previous law, which allowed abortion until the 20th week of pregnancy. The state\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature passed the new law last week during a marathon, 15-hour special session that Reynolds had called for the sole purpose of enacting what she called \u201cpro-life legislation.\u201d The new law includes exceptions for the life of the woman, miscarriages and fetal abnormalities deemed by physicians to be \u201cincompatible with life,\u201d as well as for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest. For those exceptions to apply, a rape must have been reported to law enforcement or a \u201cpublic or private health agency\u201d \u2014 which includes a family doctor \u2014 within 45 days, and incest must have been reported to any of those officials or entities within 140 days. Reproductive rights advocates have said a six-week ban amounts to a total ban because many women don\u2019t even know they are pregnant that early. Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa and the Emma Goldman Clinic, a women\u2019s health care facility in Iowa City, sued to block the law from going into effect Wednesday \u2014 less than 12 hours after the Legislature passed it \u2014 arguing it violates the Iowa Constitution. Reproductive rights groups had said that if the law went into effect immediately, it would send abortion clinics and patients in the state scrambling. Officials with Planned Parenthood said clinics in the state stayed open Thursday until 10 p.m. providing care in anticipation of Friday\u2019s signing. In their challenge, they had asked Seidlin to block the law from going into effect at all. At a hearing Friday that ran concurrent to Reynolds\u2019 signing ceremony, Seidlin said that their request \u201crequires my strong and lengthy attention\u201d and that he \u201ccould not think of anything that could be more insulting\u201d than rapidly issuing a ruling on the challenge. Reproductive rights groups welcomed Monday's ruling. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling means patients across Iowa will be able to access abortion care and retain control over their bodies and futures,\" Ruth Richardson, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, said in a statement. She added that the group \"will continue to oppose this egregious, unconstitutional ban as it works its way through the courts.\u201d The new law came just weeks after the state Supreme Court issued a split decision allowing an earlier six-week abortion ban \u2014 which was enacted in 2018 \u2014 to remain permanently blocked. While the new one is almost identical to the six-week ban that remains blocked, the outcome of the challenge this time around could be different, because there will be a full state Supreme Court issuing a decision. The state Supreme Court\u2019s split ruling last month was a narrowly tailored decision based largely on procedural grounds, meaning it remains possible \u2014 if not likely \u2014 that a full seven-member court could find legal consensus on a new ban. One of the court\u2019s seven justices, Dana Oxley \u2014 a Reynolds appointee \u2014 recused herself from the challenge to the 2018 law because her former law firm represented an abortion clinic that was a plaintiff in the original case. The split decision last month featured three justices suggesting they could support a legal standard \u2014 known as \u201crational basis\u201d \u2014 that could allow a six-week abortion limit to stand in the future. If Oxley were part of the next decision, a clear, legally binding majority on a six-week ban would most likely result. On the other hand, in their challenge to the latest law filed last week, reproductive rights groups argued that a higher standard \u2014 called the \u201cundue burden\u201d standard \u2014 remains applied by judges. While that standard was struck down on the national level in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs ruling last year, which overturned Roe v. Wade, it still remains in effect in Iowa.",

Russell was checked by city fire medics, who took her to a hospital for a more comprehensive evaluation, Hoover Police Capt. Keith Czeskleba said in a statement Saturday night. Russell also provided a statement to police. \"The details of that statement are a part of the ongoing investigation which is expected to continue over the next few days,\" the police department said in a news release Sunday. Russell had been treated and released by Sunday afternoon. Police provided no further information about her condition or where she has been since Thursday night. Authorities found a vehicle belonging to Russell and some of her possessions shortly after 9:30 p.m. Thursday, police said, but they could find neither her nor any child after the call to 911. She also called a family member to report that she had seen a toddler on the interstate. \u201cA single witness has reported possibly seeing a gray vehicle with a light-complected male standing outside of Carlee\u2019s vehicle, but we have no further information on that individual or the vehicle at this time,\u201d Lt. Daniel Lowe said. Police had asked for tips. Russell left work in Birmingham around 8:20 p.m., and she stopped to pick up some food before she made the call about the child, police said. She disappeared sometime after 9:36 p.m., when she called 911 and her family about the toddler. Investigators found Russell's wig, cellphone and purse on the roadway near her vehicle. Her Apple Watch was in her purse, police said. Investigators were analyzing her cellphone, Lowe said. A $20,000 reward was offered by a donor who wished to remain anonymous, and Crime Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward, Lowe said. Russell called and reported seeing a toddler walking on I-459 South and stopped by mile marker 11, police said. Jefferson State Community College said that Russell is a student and that the entire community was praying for her. Hoover is a city of around 92,000 south of Birmingham.",

The 33-year-old man was described as a suspect. He was not immediately identified, and his next of kin had not been notified by Monday evening, police said. The man was armed with what police said was an AK-47 rifle when he pointed it officers at 5:48 p.m., Police Chief Lee Bercaw told reporters. A vehicle chase ended with the man crashing into another vehicle, Bercaw said. \u201cImmediately after the crash, the suspect opened fire on our Tampa police officers with that assault rifle,\u201d he said. The suspect was fatally shot. The number of officers who returned fire is part of the investigation, Bercaw said at a news conference. The violence began Monday afternoon when the suspect allegedly stabbed the mother of his children, who was in critical condition at a hospital, police said. He then took the children to his brother\u2019s house, left them there and stole his brother\u2019s AK-47 before he left, Bercaw said.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the police shooting, officials said. The children, who were not injured, were with a family member Monday night, police said.

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Monday he disagrees with \u201ceverything\u201d Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reportedly said last week about Covid-19\u2019s being bioengineered \u201cto attack Caucasians and Black people\u201d and about Jewish people\u2019s being \"most immune.\" But McCarthy, R-Calif., rejected calls by Democrats to cancel Kennedy\u2019s public appearance Thursday before a Republican-controlled House committee. Kennedy, an environmental attorney, has pushed conspiracy theories, some of them about the safety of vaccines. \u201cI disagree with everything he said,\u201d McCarthy told reporters in the Capitol. \u201cThe hearing that we have this week is about censorship. I don\u2019t think censoring somebody is actually the answer here.  \u201cI think if you\u2019re going to look at censorship in America \u2014 your first action is to censor him probably plays into some of the problems we have,\u201d he said. A group of House Democrats urged McCarthy and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Monday to block Kennedy from testifying before the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, which Jordan also leads. Kennedy was recorded on video at a New York City dinner discussing \u201cethnically targeted microbes,\u201d during which, according to a video posted by the New York Post, he claimed that \u201cCovid-19 attacks certain races disproportionately.\u201d \u201cCovid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether it was deliberately targeted that or not.\u201d An overwhelming proportion of American Jews are Ashkenazi Jews. NBC News has not verified the video. Kennedy said his remarks were not antisemitic. The Democrats likened Kennedy's comments suggesting that the coronavirus was bioengineered to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people from infection to a technique used by Hitler. They also call on congressional leadership and members of Congress to condemn his comments. \u201cMr. Kennedy has repeatedly and recently spread vile and dangerous antisemitic and anti-Asian conspiracy theories that tarnish his credibility as a witness and must not be legitimized with his appearance before the U.S. Congress nor given the platform of an official committee hearing to spread his baseless and discriminatory views,\u201d reads a draft version of the letter, which was shared with NBC News by a source familiar with it who was not authorized to share a version before it is finalized. The letter is being led by Democratic Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, Dan Goldman of New York and Judy Chu of California, with organizing help from Rep. Kathy Manning of North Carolina. \u201cBy promoting the unfounded notion that scientists are developing bioweapons that can target certain races and exempt others, while referring to Jews as a separate race, Mr. Kennedy is employing a pernicious form of antisemitism that has been used for centuries,\u201d the draft says. \u201cThis technique was used by Hitler claiming that there are biological differences between ethnic or racial groups to portray Jews as a lesser form of humanity, a steppingstone to justifying the annihilation of the Jews during the Holocaust,\u201d it says. Punchbowl News first reported the existence and contents of the letter. A spokesman for Jordan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Kennedy, who is challenging President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination next year, will speak about \u201cfighting antisemitism and championing Israel\u201d at an event in New York City next week, his campaign said. Members of both parties have come under fire for making antisemitic remarks ahead of Israeli President Isaac Herzog\u2019s address to Congress on Wednesday. Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., faced backlash from both Democrats and Republicans after she called Israel a \u201cracist state\u201d at a progressive conference over the weekend.  She apologized, but McCarthy piled on Jayapal on Monday and urged Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to hold people in his party accountable for making antisemitic comments. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first person in the Democratic conference that has continued to make antisemitic comments.\u201d McCarthy said when he was asked about Jayapal. \u201cI think if they want to believe that they do not have a conference that continues to make antisemitic remarks, they need to do something about it, because they\u2019ve defended these individuals time and again.\u201d A number of progressive Democrats said they plan to boycott Herzog's speech to lawmakers, including Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman, both of New York.",

        "content": "Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, apologized Sunday for characterizing Israel as a \u201cracist state\u201d over the weekend. Jayapal's initial comments were quickly criticized by both Democrats and Republicans. More than 40 House Democrats signed a statement condemning them, and a top GOP leader said the House would vote Tuesday on a resolution expressing congressional support for Israel. Jayapal criticized Israel as she tried to quiet a group holding Palestinian flags at a conference for the progressive Netroots Nation over the weekend. \u201cHey guys, can I say something? Can I say something as somebody that\u2019s been in the streets and has participated in a lot of demonstrations?\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cI want you to know that we have been fighting to make it clear that Israel is a racist state, that the Palestinian people deserve self-determination and autonomy, that the dream of a two-state solution is slipping away from us, that it does not even feel possible. \u201cWhile you may have arguments with whether or not some of us onstage are fighting hard enough, I do want you to know that there is an organized opposition on the other side, and it isn\u2019t the people that are on this stage,\u201d she added. Jayapal\u2019s comments were swiftly met with backlash on both sides of the aisle after a video of them was widely circulated on social media. Jayapal walked back her remarks Sunday, issuing a lengthy statement to clarify them while defending the sentiment behind them. Jayapal said she was trying to \u201cdefuse a tense situation\u201d at the conference and offered \u201cmy apologies to those who I have hurt with my words.\u201d \u201cWords do matter and so it is important that I clarify my statement,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cI do not believe the idea of Israel as a nation is racist. \u201cI do, however, believe that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu\u2019s extreme right-wing government has engaged in discriminatory and outright racist policies and that there are extreme racists driving that policy within the leadership of the current government,\u201d she added. In a statement Monday, 43 congressional Democrats condemned Jayapal's remarks. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about Representative Pramila Jayapal\u2019s unacceptable comments regarding our historic, democratic ally Israel, and we appreciate her retraction,\u201d they wrote. \"Israel is the legitimate homeland of the Jewish people and efforts to delegitimize and demonize it are not only dangerous and antisemitic, but they also undermine America\u2019s national security,\" the lawmakers added. The statement was organized by Democratic Reps. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, Greg Landsman of Ohio, Brad Schneider of Illinois, Dean Phillips of Minnesota, Jared Moskowitz of Florida and Kathy Manning of North Carolina. Republicans also criticized Jayapal's remarks. Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, said in a statement that \u201crepeated comments\u201d from Jayapal and other progressive Democrats that denigrated Israel \u201care unacceptable and disgusting.\u201d He also introduced a resolution Monday expressing support for Israel. The resolution, introduced with GOP Reps. David Kustoff of Tennessee and Max Miller of Ohio, says that it's the sense of Congress that Israel \u201cis not a racist or apartheid state,\u201d that Congress rejects all forms of antisemitism and xenophobia and that the U.S. \u201cwill always be a staunch partner and supporter of Israel.\u201d House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., confirmed to reporters that the resolution would be put to a vote Tuesday. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is scheduled to visit the White House and deliver an address to Congress during his two-day trip to Washington this week. House Democratic leaders sought to distance themselves from Jayapal\u2019s remarks in a statement Sunday, saying Israel is \u201cnot a racist state.\u201d \u201cAs House Democratic leaders, we strongly support Israel\u2019s right to exist as a homeland for the Jewish people,\u201d wrote House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar and Vice Chair Ted Lieu, both of California. Still, some Democrats appeared to defend aspects of Jayapal's comments. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., said Monday there\u2019s a distinction between criticism of and opposition to Israel, a longtime U.S. ally. \u201cWe\u2019re critical of the U.S. government every day, and we work here,\u201d Bowman, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told NBC News. \u201cBeing critical of Israel is not anti-Israel, is definitely not antisemitic. I\u2019m a Black man in America \u2014 how the hell can I be antisemitic toward anybody else? I know what it is to suffer and be oppressed and be threatened and killed because of who you are.\u201d",

        "title": "Long Island police search storage units in Gilgo Beach murders",
        "content": "Authorities on Monday executed a search warrant at a second storage unit in Amityville, Long Island, New York, related to the Gilgo Beach murders as the suspect was placed on suicide watch. The Suffolk County Police Department said an initial search warrant had been issued Sunday for a separate storage unit in Amityville. It's unclear who rented the two units, and the owner of both sites, Omega Self Storage, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Suffolk County district attorney, Tania Lopez, declined to comment about what investigators are looking for. The storage facilities were searched as investigators say they are still receiving information from the public after the arrest of Rex Heuermann, a Manhattan architect living in Massapequa Park, Long Island, in connection with a sprawling case that had long gone cold before his arrest. Lopez said the DA\u2019s office cannot disclose any new evidence received from search warrants or from the public after Heuermann\u2019s arrest. Heuermann, 59, was charged Friday with three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of three women who had gone missing from 2009 to 2010. He is also suspected in the disappearance and death of a fourth woman, but that investigation remains ongoing, prosecutors say. On Monday afternoon, the Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Heuermann \u201cis currently on suicide watch which is determined by the County\u2019s mental health staff.\u201d Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney said Monday that the mountain of evidence, which includes DNA, cellphone records and a witness tip, gives his office confidence it can prove its case. \"We're also confident that we're going to be able to eventually charge that fourth murder,\" Tierney said on CNN. While 11 sets of human remains have been found since 2010 around the area of Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach, a remote stretch along Long Island's South Shore, Heuermann is not suspected in all of the slayings. The deaths, many tied to missing sex workers from the New York and New Jersey area, had set off fears that a serial killer was on the loose. In the wake of Heuermann's arrest on Thursday evening, authorities began searching his home in Massapequa Park, a village across the bay from Gilgo Beach, and his office in midtown Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Michael J. Brown, said Heuermann has been a \"loving\" husband and father to his daughter and stepson, and \"has insisted he did not commit these crimes.\" \"There is nothing about Mr. Heuermann that would suggest that he is involved in these incidents,\" Brown said in a statement. \"And while the government has decided to focus on him despite more significant and stronger leads, we are looking forward to defending him in a court of law before a fair and impartial jury of his peers.\" Heuermann is charged with the slayings of Melissa Barthelemy, 24; Megan Waterman, 22; and Amber Lynn Costello 27. The investigation into the death of a fourth woman, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, is ongoing with no immediate timeline for when it could be resolved, Lopez said. The women were all believed to be sex workers who advertised on online sites, according to police. They were all found in similar positions and bound with either belts or tape, court documents say. The bodies of three of those women were also wrapped in burlap-type material. After years of an investigation with no prime suspect, a joint law enforcement review jumpstarted in early 2022 brought attention to a Chevrolet Avalanche registered to Heuermann. Such a vehicle had been on investigators' radar during Costello's disappearance from a witness' tip. In addition, authorities said, burner cellphones and credit card activity helped them to link Heuermann with the crimes. Investigators also said they tested hair found on one of the victims that matched Heuermann's wife, who was out of town during the various killings. \"As such, it is likely that the burlap, tape, vehicle(s) or other instrumentalities utilized in furtherance of these murders came from Defendant Heuermann's residence, where his wife also resides, or was transferred from his clothing,\" prosecutors said. A male hair was also found on the burlap used to wrap one of the victims, according to investigators. Police collected a discarded pizza thrown away by Heuermann and swabbed a pizza crust for DNA. Based on lab results in June, investigators said his DNA \"cannot be excluded\" from matching the male hair.",

        "title": "Citing Trump, Pentagon leak suspect Teixeira urges judge to release him while he awaits trial",
        "content": "BOSTON \u2014 The Massachusetts Air National Guard member accused of leaking secret military papers challenged a judge\u2019s decision that he remain behind bars, pointing Monday to the pretrial release of former President Donald Trump and others charged in high-profile classified documents cases. A magistrate judge who ruled in May that 21-year-old Jack Teixeira must remain behind bars while the case plays out found that releasing him would pose a risk that he would attempt to flee the country or obstruct justice. Teixeira\u2019s lawyers are now asking a different judge to reverse that decision. In court papers, the defense attorneys argued that Teixeira has no financial ability or incentive to flee, and claimed the government \u201cgreatly overexaggerates Mr. Teixeira\u2019s risk to national security.\u201d Teixeira\u2019s lawyers noted that prosecutors did not seek to detain Trump \u2014 or his co-defendant, Walt Nauta \u2014 even though the former president and his valet \u201cpossess extraordinary means to flee the United States.\u201d \u201cFormer President Trump and The Trump Organization own properties in multiple foreign countries, and former President Trump has access to a private plane. Yet, the risk of flight posed by their knowledge of national security information, and their abnormal ability to flee, didn\u2019t even result in a request that either surrender their passport,\u201d Teixeira\u2019s lawyers wrote. Teixeira\u2019s attorneys wrote that the \u201cdisparate approach\u201d in these cases \u2014 which are both charged under the Espionage Act \u2014 shows that the government\u2019s \u201cargument for Mr. Teixeira\u2019s detention on this basis is illusory.\u201d Teixeira pleaded not guilty last month to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information. Each count is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Trump has also pleaded not guilty to dozens of felony counts accusing him of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and refusing government demands to give them back. While Trump was not required to surrender a passport \u2014 prosecutors said he was not considered a flight risk \u2014 the magistrate judge directed the former president to not discuss the case with certain witnesses. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and attacked the prosecution as politically motivated. Teixeira, of North Dighton, has been behind bars since his April arrest on charges stemming from the most consequential intelligence leak in years. His lawyers have suggested that he be released to his father and largely confined to his home with location monitoring and no access to the internet. Teixeira is accused of sharing classified military documents about Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and other sensitive national security topics on Discord, a social media platform popular with people playing online games. Authorities say Teixeira, who enlisted in the Air National Guard in 2019, began around January sharing military secrets with other Discord users \u2014 first by typing out classified documents and then sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP SECRET markings. Teixeira worked as a a \u201ccyber transport systems specialist,\u201d essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks. Authorities have provided few details about an alleged possible motive, but accounts of those in the online private chat group where the documents were disclosed have depicted Teixeira as motivated more by bravado than ideology. The judge\u2019s decision to detain Teixeira came after Justice Department lawyers revealed in court filings a history of disturbing online remarks. He wrote in November that he would \u201ckill a (expletive) ton of people\u201d if he had his way, because it would be \u201cculling the weak minded.\u201d Prosecutors also argued he said he may still have material that hasn\u2019t been released, which could be of \u201ctremendous value to hostile nation states that could offer him safe harbor and attempt to facilitate his escape from the United States.\u201d Teixeira\u2019s lawyers wrote that there is no evidence their client \u201cever carried his online conversations into reality or ever endangered any person in his community.\u201d They also said there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that Teixeira is so valuable that a foreign adversary would be willing to smuggle him out of the country.",

        "title": "Firefighters are leaving the U.S. Forest Service for better pay and benefits",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Thousands of federal wildland firefighters could walk off the job if Congress fails to pass a permanent pay increase, officials and advocates warned amid an already scorching summer that could lead to an explosion of wildfires later in the year. From 30% to 50% of the roughly 11,000 firefighters who combat wildfires across millions of acres of land managed by the U.S. Forest Service could resign in coming seasons without a longterm solution to persistently low wages and poor benefits, according to the National Federation of Federal Employees. \u201cThis is an absolute crisis,\u201d said Max Alonzo, an organizer with the federation. \u201cThe majority of people I know already have their applications out for other jobs and they\u2019re just waiting.\u201d The situation has grown so dire that the San Bernardino National Forest in Southern California saw 42 resignations in 48 hours in May, officials said. Many of those firefighters left for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, which is viewed as a prime gig thanks to its generous salaries, robust benefits and manageable work schedule that was recently negotiated down to a 66-hour work week from 72 hours. \u201cSoon there won\u2019t be anybody left,\u201d said Steve Gutierrez, a former hotshot who recently left the Forest Service after 15 years to advocate on behalf of firefighters through the federation. \u201cWe train them and Cal Fire takes them.\u201d Aaron Foye, who resigned from the San Bernardino National Forest last September for a job as an engineer with Cal Fire, estimated staff shortages were so high when he left that only one out of four fire engine crews was staffed seven days a week. \u201cI felt like I was being selfish working at the Forest Service because I wasn\u2019t really providing enough for my family,\u201d Foye said. \u201cAll of our best talent with the Forest Service has bled out in the last two years.\" Lawmakers have introduced bills this year in the House and the Senate that would codify an existing pay increase under President Joe's Biden's infrastructure bill, which temporarily bumped salaries for wildland firefighters by up to $20,000. Without a permanent fix, that increase is set to expire at the end of September and roll back salaries for thousands of federal firefighters. \u201cWe absolutely need Congress to take action and put in place a permanent pay fix,\u201d said Forest Service Deputy Chief Jaelith Hall-Rivera. \u201cIf we\u2019re not able to do that and we\u2019re not able to give them that certainty going into the future, they are going to need to look elsewhere for a position that does provide that certainty.\u201d Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of six senators introduced the Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act, which would keep the current pay raise and help to ensure the federal government can recruit and retain a sufficient firefighting workforce for years to come. In May, a bipartisan bill was reintroduced in the House that would similarly increase pay and address firefighters' mental and physical health, housing, retirement and tuition assistance benefits. It was referred to the forestry subcommittee in June. Federal wildland firefighters have long warned that without a permanent pay raise, their ranks would dwindle even as wildfires continue to increase in both intensity and frequency across the country and beyond. The expertise of federal firefighters is unrivaled when compared with the experience of those who work for municipal and state agencies, which might not include hiking through rugged and dangerous terrain or dropping from helicopters into the middle of a forest. Federal firefighters are also able to traverse state and international borders, including joining Canadian forces this year to battle historic blazes north of the United States. Still, the Forest Service has struggled in recent years to fill vacancies amid rising inflation and severe drought, officials said. In 2021, during one of the most destructive fire seasons in history, the agency also faced shrinking water, food and communications supplies in addition to low staffing levels. This year, the Forest Service has 11,150 wildland firefighters onboard nationwide, or 99% of its goal of 11,300, the agency said. For many men and women on the front lines of fighting fires, the high cost of living means more stress for them and their families, and they begin looking for some relief. At Cal Fire, the state added 37 fire crews to its staff in 2022 after adding 16 in 2021. An additional $671.4 million in the 2022-2023 fiscal year will pay for 1,265 new positions and expand fire crews, air attack operations and additional staff relief, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom's office. A recent report by Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy organization, found that federal firefighters were paid on average 32.51% below their state counterparts. In California, the disparity is just above 56%. \"I wish I had done it sooner,\" Foye said of joining Cal Fire. \"Best decision I ever made.\" Still, when asked if he would return to the federal agency should conditions improve, he said: \u201cI would return in a heartbeat.\u201d As federal firefighters wait for Congress to act, their families say they are held hostage to the whims of lawmakers. Janelle Valentine feels nothing but admiration and pride for her husband, who is a federal firefighter in the Gila National Forest. She gave up her own career in early childhood education to move from Arizona to New Mexico when her husband was placed there, and now lives an hour away from the nearest grocery store while her husband spends nearly half the year fighting fires. She said the sacrifice was worth it because they are both passionate about the Forest Service's mission, but she wonders how much longer they can hold on. \"We\u2019ve been hanging on by the skin of our teeth and wanting it to work out, but we can\u2019t afford it at this point,\" she said. Valentine said they were forced to buy a trailer home for her husband to live in while on assignment because the government housing that was offered was dilapidated and moldy. They are barely able to cover the trailer's cost and their mortgage while Valentine works on earning a master's degree in social work. \"It\u2019s such a low cost of living here, and we\u2019re still drowning,\" she said. \"At what point do you just jump ship with something you love?\"",

        "title": "New Mexico's Maggie Toulouse met with federal prosecutors for 2020 special counsel probe",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The top state election official in New Mexico has spoken with federal prosecutors as part of the special counsel\u2019s probe into the 2020 election, the official\u2019s spokesman said Friday. The meeting with New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver occurred sometime in the past few months, according to spokesman Alex Curtas, who declined further comment. The Justice Department has spent months examining pressure campaigns by Trump associates aimed at getting battleground states won by Democrat Joe Biden to undo the results of their elections. Special counsel Jack Smith and his team have issued subpoenas to election officials in states that Trump disputed, seeking correspondence from Trump associates and campaign aides, and have also lined up interviews in recent months with state officials. The communications with state officials are one prong of a much bigger probe by Smith and his team into efforts to block the transfer of power from Trump to Biden. It is not clear when Smith\u2019s investigation into the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot might end or whether anyone might be charged. A spokesman for Smith declined to comment on Friday. It\u2019s unknown what questions were asked of Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat in her second term, about the 2020 election in New Mexico. After Biden won the state by nearly 11 percentage points, Trump\u2019s campaign briefly challenged the results in court before dropping the lawsuit. Republicans in the state submitted false Electoral College certificates declaring Trump the winner \u2014 though the fake electors added a caveat saying the certificates were submitted in case they were later recognized as duly elected, qualified electors. Although Democrats control every statewide elected office in New Mexico, with majorities in the Statehouse, false claims of fraud and manipulation of voting machines in 2020 have resonated in some politically conservative communities, including Otero County, where commissioners in June 2022 initially refused to certify election results. Former Otero County commissioner and Cowboys for Trump cofounder Couy Griffin was barred last year from holding public office for engaging in insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson have also spoken with officials from Smith\u2019s office in recent months, according to their staffs. Kathy Boockvar, the chief state election official in Pennsylvania during the 2020 election, said Friday she has not been asked for an interview. It was not currently clear whether state officials overseeing elections in 2020 in Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin \u2014 other states disputed by Trump -- have been interviewed. Claire Woodall-Vogg, the head of Milwaukee\u2019s election commission, said in an email that she met virtually with investigators a month or two ago. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what if any details I can divulge, so not much more to say,\u201d she said. Efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn his loss in Georgia are also the subject of a separate investigation in Atlanta\u2019s Fulton County with local prosecutors saying they expect a decision later this summer on next steps. It was in a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call that Trump suggested Raffensperger could help \u201cfind\u201d the votes necessary to reverse Biden\u2019s win.",

Her condition was not released in a statement Monday. The woman, from Phoenix, walked away from the bison after she and the person she was with spotted two of the animals, the National Park Service said. One of the bison charged. Park officials routinely warn visitors to stay at least 25 yards away from bison \u2014 it was not known how far away the woman was when the bison charged, the park said. The incident remained under investigation Monday, the park said. It occurred Sunday morning in a field on the north shore of Lake Yellowstone, near the Lake Lodge Cabins, it said. Bison can get more easily agitated during mating season, which is from mid-July through mid-August, it said. It\u2019s the first time this year a bison has gored someone at the park, Monday\u2019s statement said. More than 3.2 million people visited Yellowstone last year, and the park over the last decade has frequently topped 4 million, according to statistics from the park service.",

Kennedy apologized and said he was \"deeply sorry\" for those remarks.",

The women's bodies were found within 100 miles of one another, the Portland Police Bureau said in a news release over the weekend. Police have not determined whether they were all homicide victims, but they were all under age 40.  Although news of the deaths was widely circulated on social media, the Portland Police Bureau said there was no reason to believe the deaths were connected. \u201cThese discussions have led to some anxiety and fear in our community, and we want to provide reassurance that the speculation is not supported by the facts available at this point,\u201d the department said in the statement. The body of Kristin Smith, 22, was discovered on Feb. 19 in southeast Portland. Police said her cause of death has not been determined. JoAnna Speaks, 32, was found dead on April 8 inside a barn at an abandoned property in Ridgefield, Washington, about 22 miles north of Portland, authorities said. She died of blunt-force trauma to her neck and head, according to the Clark County Medical Examiner. Charity Lynn Perry, 24, was found in a culvert by the East Historic Columbia River Highway in Multnomah County on April 24, said Deputy John Plock, a spokesman for the sheriff's office. The same day, an unidentified woman was found dead inside a tent in Portland, police said, adding she may have been Indigenous, and there were no signs of foul play. Bridget Webster, 31, was discovered on a rural road in Polk County on April 30, and Ashley Real, 22, was found in a wooded area on May 7. \u201cIt\u2019s just so heartbreaking, and it\u2019s really hard to put into words,\u201d Robyn Speaks, JoAnna Speaks' sister, told NBC affiliate KGW of Portland. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hitting us more that it\u2019s real, and we keep seeing on the news all these new girls.\u201d JoAnna Speak's stepsister Ariel Hamby said in an interview with \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d that she was horrified and heartbroken. \u201cShe was an amazing sister and wonderful daughter and a fantastic mother,\u201d Hamby said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about my sister anymore even if it\u2019s not one person doing this.\" Webster's stepgrandfather, who would provide only his first name, Tom, because he said he has been inundated with phone calls about the women, said he raised Webster \"until she left when she was a freshman in high school.\" \u201cShe was a good girl until I lost contact with her years ago,\u201d Tom said, adding that he changed her diapers and taught her how to play basketball. Multiple police and sheriff's departments are investigating the cases, and the Portland Police Bureau said it was also working with the county and state medical examiner's offices. \u201cOne of the main things that they are going to be looking at is the manner of death and the weapon,\" Bryanna Fox, a former FBI special agent, told \u201cNBC Nightly News.\u201d \"If that\u2019s consistent across all of these victims, then that will be a huge point.\u201d",

        "title": "Appeals court pauses order limiting Biden admin social media contact",
        "content": "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 A federal appeals court Friday temporarily paused a lower court\u2019s order limiting executive branch officials\u2019 communications with social media companies about controversial online posts. Biden administration lawyers had asked the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to stay the preliminary injunction issued on July 4 by U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty. Doughty himself had rejected a request to put his order on hold pending appeal. Friday\u2019s brief 5th Circuit order put Doughty\u2019s injunction on hold \u201cuntil further orders of the court.\u201d It called for arguments in the case to be scheduled on an expedited basis. Filed last year, the lawsuit claimed the administration, in effect, censored free speech by discussing possible regulatory action the government could take while pressuring companies to remove what it deemed misinformation. COVID-19 vaccines, legal issues involving President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter and election fraud allegations were among the topics spotlighted in the lawsuit. Doughty, nominated to the federal bench by former President Donald Trump, issued an Independence Day order and accompanying reasons that covered more than 160 pages. He said the plaintiffs were likely to win their ongoing lawsuit. His injunction blocked the Department of Health and Human Services, the FBI and multiple other government agencies and administration officials from \u201cencouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech.\u201d Administration lawyers said the order was overly broad and vague, raising questions about what officials can say in conversations with social media companies or in public statements. They said Doughty\u2019s order posed a threat of \u201cgrave\u201d public harm by chilling executive branch efforts to combat online misinformation. Doughty rejected the administration\u2019s request for a stay on Monday, writing: \u201cDefendants argue that the injunction should be stayed because it might interfere with the Government\u2019s ability to continue working with social-media companies to censor Americans\u2019 core political speech on the basis of viewpoint. In other words, the Government seeks a stay of the injunction so that it can continue violating the First Amendment.\u201d In its request that the 5th Circuit issue a stay, administration lawyers said there has been no evidence of threats by the administration. \u201cThe district court identified no evidence suggesting that a threat accompanied any request for the removal of content. Indeed, the order denying the stay \u2014 presumably highlighting the ostensibly strongest evidence \u2014 referred to \u2018a series of public media statements,\u2019\u201d the administration said. Friday\u2019s \u201cadministrative stay\u201d was issued without comment by a panel of three 5th Circuit judges: Carl Stewart, nominated to the court by former President Bill Clinton; James Graves, nominated by former President Barack Obama; and Andrew Oldham, nominated by Trump. A different panel drawn from the court, which has 17 active members, will hear arguments on a longer stay.",

Kennedy Jr., lambasted her brother in a brief statement Monday after a report quoted him as saying that Covid-19 was \"targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people\" and that Jewish people are most immune. \"I strongly condemn my brother\u2019s deplorable and untruthful remarks last week about Covid being engineered for ethnic targeting,\" Kerry Kennedy said in a statement released by the nonprofit group Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, where she is president. \"His statements do not represent what I believe or what Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights stand for, with our 50+-year track record of protecting rights and standing against racism and all forms of discrimination,\" she added. On Saturday, the New York Post published an article that included a video that appeared to show Robert Kennedy speaking at a dinner in Manhattan about bioweapons and \"ethnically targeted microbes\" in which he claimed that \"Covid-19 attacks certain races disproportionately.\" \"Covid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese,\" he said, according to the video published by the Post. \"We don\u2019t know whether it was deliberately targeted that or not.\" An overwhelming proportion of American Jews are Ashkenazi Jews, who are descended from Jews who lived in Central and Eastern Europe. NBC News has not verified the video. In a statement on Twitter later in the day, Kennedy defended his remarks, saying they were not antisemitic. Former Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., also weighed in Monday, tweeting that he condemns his uncle's remarks. Robert Kennedy has been repeatedly criticized for pushing conspiracy theories, some about vaccines. Kerry Kennedy, 63, his sister, also blasted her brother, 69, when he launched his presidential bid in April. \"I love my brother Bobby, but I do not share or endorse his opinions on many issues, including the COVID pandemic, vaccinations, and the role of social media platforms in policing false information,\" she said at the time. \"It is also important to note that Bobby\u2019s views are not reflected in or influence the mission or work of our organization.\" Other members of their family have also rebuked him over the conspiracy theories about vaccines and misinformation he has spread for years. At the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denounced the remarks Monday. \"The claims made on that tape is false. It is vile,\" she said at the daily briefing. \"They put our fellow Americans in danger if you think about the racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories that come out of saying those types of things. It's an attack on our fellow citizens, our fellow Americans. So it's important that we speak out.\"",

        "content": "In the days after her husband was reported missing to the Texas Army base where he was stationed, Cam Chamberlain sent a series of urgent Facebook messages to a longtime friend: When he disappeared, she said, he left her with no food and no money. She wasn\u2019t working, she was estranged from her family, and her efforts to get help from the Army had gone nowhere, two longtime friends said.   \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she wrote to Jessica D\u2019Lynn Pyles in a message the friend shared with NBC News. \u201cI\u2019m alone. I just want the pain to go away. I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d Within a week of that message, Cam Chamberlain\u2019s death was announced, and the next day, her husband \u2014 who had been missing for 11 days \u2014 was discovered alive. Spc. Craig Chamberlain, 23, had \u201cwillfully\u201d disappeared from his unit, according to Army officials at his post, Fort Cavazos. Military authorities have offered few answers about what happened, and friends of Cam Chamberlain, who was in her late 20s, have said they\u2019ve found no solace in the aftermath of her death: There have been no autopsy, no obituary and no funeral.  Officials confirmed her death in a statement May 25. The couple lived off base, and a spokeswoman for the Killeen Police Department referred questions about the case to Fort Cavazos authorities, who put out a statement confirming the death. They didn\u2019t provide details about when or where she died, and her cause and manner of death haven\u2019t been disclosed.  Army investigators launched a criminal probe. A spokeswoman for the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division declined to comment further, citing an ongoing investigation. \u201cI can\u2019t even mourn her death the way family should, because it\u2019s as if she never existed at all now,\u201d said Shandy Eubank, one of the longtime friends. The day after authorities announced that his wife had died, Craig Chamberlain was found in \u201crough shape\u201d in the Killeen area, said his mother, Virginia Chamberlain. In an interview with NBC News, she declined to say where her son is now. A spokeswoman at Fort Cavazos declined to discuss his status in the Army, saying he was the subject of an administrative investigation in connection with his disappearance. The inquiry has been completed but can\u2019t be disclosed because of privacy rules. A quick marriage and an overseas assignment Craig and Cam Chamberlain met a few years ago through a dating app and were married in 2020, according to her Facebook page. Though Eubank believed the couple had rushed things, they initially seemed happy, she said. \u201cThe way he treated her \u2014 he put her on a pedestal,\u201d said Eubank, who met Cam when they worked together at an insurance company in Waco more than a decade ago. \u201cHe treated her better than anyone had treated her.\u201d She was a people person, Eubank said \u2014 someone who was as outspoken as she was happy and goofy.   D\u2019Lynn Pyles said, \u201cYou knew where she stood on things.\u201d In an interview with a Texas newspaper, Cam described her husband as laid back, patient and carefree. He has a unicorn tattooed on the upper part of his right arm, his mother said. Craig Chamberlain was assigned to the 704th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company at Fort Cavazos, formerly known as Fort Hood, one of the largest Army bases in the country, which sits roughly midway between Austin and Waco.  A rift emerged between the couple over time, which Cam attributed partly to difficult family dynamics, Eubank said. Cam publicly identified as a transgender woman and had a rocky relationship with her own family, telling friends that her mother had \u201cdisowned\u201d her, Eubank and D\u2019Lynn Pyles recalled. Efforts to reach Cam Chamberlain\u2019s mother were unsuccessful. Messages left at a phone number listed as her brother\u2019s weren\u2019t returned. Cam told Eubank that she struggled with her husband\u2019s family, as well. Eubank remembered her friend recounting a conversation in which her mother-in-law challenged her ability to be in a loving relationship: \u201cHow can she know she loves Craig when she doesn\u2019t know what gender she is?\u201d  Virginia Chamberlain called the comment \u201cvery, very inaccurate.\u201d \u201cDid we have our differences? Absolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will say I never bullied Cam. I never said a statement like that to Cam. Not once did that ever come out of my mouth.\u201d Craig Chamberlain\u2019s father, Gordon Chamberlain, added that although he hadn\u2019t met Cam before his son married her, \u201cI said we\u2019d treat Cam like anyone else that comes into our lives.\u201d The Army was sending Craig to South Korea, and Cam planned to \u201cstick with him,\u201d Eubank said, despite the growing tension between them. Fort Cavazos officials confirmed he had been ordered to South Korea in December for a long-term assignment.  In a Jan. 8 Facebook post, Cam seemed excited about the trip \u2014 and traveling to other parts of Asia. \u201cCan\u2019t wait for the FOOD,\u201d she wrote in a post that D\u2019Lynn Pyles captured in a screenshot and shared with NBC News. \u201cI love real Asian food.\u201d But months passed, and the couple went nowhere. Then, on March 20, she posted that her husband\u2019s orders had been deferred for six months \u2014 and that she learned so only the night before he was to have left. \u201cYou never know what comes next,\u201d she wrote in another post that D\u2019Lynn Pyles shared. \u201cPlans change faster than this Texas weather.\u201d A spokeswoman for Fort Cavazos declined to comment on the deferment, saying it was part of the base\u2019s administrative investigation.  A missing soldier By the time Cam Chamberlain reported her husband missing \u2014 he had last been seen May 15 \u2014 their relationship had become so \u201ctoxic\u201d that she had planned to split up with him, she told D\u2019Lynn Pyles in a Facebook message. \u201cEven though I\u2019m getting divorced I still can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s in danger,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI still love him and I\u2019d blame myself if anything happened to him.\u201d In other messages to D\u2019Lynn Pyles, she pleaded for money. In one message, she said her husband had refused to pay her their Basic Allowance for Housing, or compensation provided to service members and their families who live off base. \"He went missing and left me with no food. No nothing,\" she said in a message. \"His command won\u2019t help me.\" In a statement, officials at Fort Cavazos didn\u2019t address Cam Chamberlain\u2019s claim. They said that \u201ccaring for our soldiers and families is a top priority.\u201d  \u201cIf soldiers and family members have pay issues that cannot be resolved at the unit level, they should seek help from their unit\u2019s personnel office,\u201d the statement said. In another message, Cam shared a missing person flyer for her husband \u2014 a flyer later circulated by local media that said Craig disappeared without his keys and phone. He\u2019d been suffering from a \u201cbout of extreme depression,\u201d the flyer said. As she searched for her husband, she tracked the sometimes grim responses to his disappearance on social media. In a lengthy comment thread on a local station\u2019s Facebook page, people made jokes about how the base\u2019s name change didn\u2019t prevent another soldier from disappearing and casually suggested his wife may have had something to do with it. In response to a user who said she hoped \u201chis wife\u201d didn\u2019t see the comments, Cam responded: \u201cI have seen them. All of them. And I hope that each and every one of them goes through the pain I am going through.\u201d She also began to talk more about her husband\u2019s disappearance. In a message to D\u2019Lynn Pyles, she said her husband had \u201clied\u201d to her about South Korea. She didn\u2019t offer additional details, but in an interview with the Killeen Daily Herald while Craig was missing, she said Army officials had recently told her that he had stopped reporting to work in March. \u201cHe told me he was going to work the whole time, so I didn\u2019t think anything of it, but in reality, he wasn\u2019t really going to work,\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201cHe was just saying he was going to work.\u201d Virginia Chamberlain cast doubt on her daughter-in-law\u2019s account, saying photos from the time show her son with long hair and a scruffy face. \"You can\u2019t report for duty like that in the Army,\" she said. Officials at Fort Cavazos said in a statement that Craig Chamberlain had \u201cfailed\u201d to travel to his new assignment for \u201cunknown reasons.\u201d A spokeswoman for the base declined to comment when she was asked about the accuracy of Cam Chamberlain\u2019s comments. A plea for help The last time D\u2019Lynn Pyles heard from Cam was May 21, when she sent a Facebook message asking for $40. She\u2019d gone to her mother\u2019s house in Fort Worth \u2014 a place where she said she was \u201cno longer welcome\u201d \u2014 and had spent the last of her money on a ride home to Killeen. D\u2019Lynn Pyles said she couldn\u2019t give her the money \u2014 she\u2019d just gone shopping and had $20 to her name, according to a screenshot of the message. \u201cI totally understand,\u201d her friend responded. Four days later, D\u2019Lynn Pyles messaged Cam \u2014 \u201cAre you good?!\u201d \u2014 and then called. There was no response, and D\u2019Lynn Pyles soon found herself on Facebook groups linked to Fort Cavazos searching for answers. The next day, on May 26, Craig Chamberlain was found alive. It was a week and a half after he had been reported missing and not long after a civilian search party set out with his parents to find him.  Virginia Chamberlain said the group \u2014 made up of \u201ccomplete strangers\u201d \u2014 were \u201cwith us every single day looking for our son.\u201d \"And they were there when we found him,\" she said. \"They are now family to us.\" The base offered few specifics about how or where Craig was found. In a statement, military officials accused him of willfully disappearing and said the search involved the \u201ctremendous efforts and support by the Fort Cavazos and Killeen communities.\u201d Virginia Chamberlain also declined to say where her son was found. She described his path forward as a \u201chard journey\u201d with \u201ca lot of healing to take place.\u201d \"This is a very delicate story,\" she added. \"There\u2019s a lot of lives that have been affected by it. My heart truly does break for Cam\u2019s friends and Cam\u2019s family \u2014 even with the things that have gone on in the past.\" For D\u2019Lynn Pyles, Cam\u2019s death was especially hard given that one of the things her friend had wanted most was a committed partner, someone with whom she could establish the kind of family she didn\u2019t have. \"Craig has been the longest relationship she\u2019d had since I\u2019ve known her,\" D\u2019Lynn Pyles said in a text. \"She was longing for THAT kind of love.\" Now, D\u2019Lynn Pyles added, she just wants the truth about Cam \u2014 \"even if it breaks my heart.\"",

In a news release, the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division cleared Spc. Craig Chamberlain, 23, in the May death of Cam Chamberlain and said her cause and manner of death will be released after an autopsy is completed. The statement, which was released Friday, added that because the investigation is active, no additional details will be released. In a text message Monday, Craig Chamberlain's mother disputed the date of death the Army released for Cam Chamberlain \u2014 May 25 \u2014 and said the Criminal Investigation Division previously told her family it was May 23. An Army spokeswoman could not immediately clarify the discrepancy. Fort Cavazos officials announced the death on May 25. \"I am glad that the truth is coming out and I know that there will be more truth to follow,\" Virginia Chamberlain said in the text. \"We do not know why it has taken so long for this to come to light.\" She called on the Killeen Police Department to release the details surrounding her daughter-in-law's death so \"Cam's loved ones and friends can have closure.\" The police department previously referred questions to the lead agency investigating her death, the Criminal Investigation Division. NBC News reported Thursday that close friends of Cam Chamberlain\u2019s have remained frustrated in the weeks after her death because authorities have released few details about it. \u201cI can\u2019t even mourn her death the way family should, because it\u2019s as if she never existed at all now,\u201d said a friend, Shandy Eubank. Efforts to reach Cam Chamberlain's family have been unsuccessful. Friends of hers have said she was estranged from relatives. Craig Chamberlain, of Fort Cavazos\u2019 704th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company, went missing May 15 in what the Army described as a \"willful\" disappearance. The base has said he was found May 26. Army officials have declined to provide more details about his status or the disappearance, which was the subject of internal inquiry. A spokeswoman for the base said the Army does not comment on administrative actions. Craig Chamberlain\u2019s mother previously said a civilian search party found him in the Killeen area \u2014 near where Fort Cavazos is located \u2014 in \"rough shape.\" She declined to provide additional details, citing his privacy, but she described his path forward as a \"hard journey\" with \"a lot of healing.\" Craig and Cam Chamberlain were married in October 2020. He was assigned to a new post in South Korea in December, Army officials have said, but for \u201cunknown reasons\u201d he never traveled to the country. In a Facebook message to a friend after Craig Chamberlain went missing, Cam Chamberlain said her husband had lied to her about the assignment, and in an interview with the Killeen Daily Herald she said military officials told her that he stopped reporting to work in March \u2014 though she said he never told her about it. In the days before her death, Cam Chamberlain told friends that her marriage had become \"toxic\" and that she was divorcing her husband.  Eubank said her friend had struggled with her husband and his family partly because of her gender identity. Cam Chamberlain publicly identified as a transgender woman. Virginia Chamberlain has rejected that claim, calling it \u201cvery, very inaccurate.\u201d ",

Pending the completion of the coroner's investigation, Blake declined to say how she might have died.

Scandrett said at a news conference Sunday afternoon. \"The entire state of Georgia can breathe a little easier tonight.\" Law enforcement tracked the suspect from Saturday's bloodshed to an area near the border between Henry and Clayton counties, about 20 miles south of Atlanta, he said. Officers exchanged gunfire with the man twice before he was \"neutralized\" and ultimately declared dead, Scandrett said. Officials had been looking for Andre Longmore, 40, and a GMC Acadia SUV he was believed to be driving. Authorities were armed with an arrest warrant Sunday based on four allegations of murder. Officials said Longmore fatally shot four residents of Dogwood Lakes Drive and Dogwood Ridge about 10:45 a.m. Saturday. On Sunday, Hampton Police Chief James Turner identified the victims as Scott Levitt, 67; Shirley Levitt, 66; Steve Blizzard, 65; and Ronald Jeffers, 66. He said motive remained a mystery. Longmore was a resident of Dogwood Lakes Drive community. The Acadia was stolen from Blizzard, Turner said. \"This community is grieving,\" Hampton City Manager Alex Cohilas said. \"We're thankful we have achieved a resolution in which no more loss of life has occurred.\" Turner said his city of more than 8,000 last reported a homicide in 2018 and is one of the safest communities in the state. \"It's just not normal for us,\" he said of Saturday's violence. Scandrett spoke of \"a couple\" of law enforcement officers who were injured Saturday. The worst of Saturday's injuries were suffered by an officer struck in his back by gunfire, the sheriff said. The officer was conscious, breathing and expected to survive, Scandrett said. At least one other officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries, officials said. The killing spree and law enforcement's response were under investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.",

        "title": "EPA Power Plant Rule Anchors Biden's Wider Climate Agenda",
        "content": "(To get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.) The Environmental Protection Agency has been on a rulemaking frenzy this year, issuing a suite of new regulations over the past few months designed to cut pollution. From rules on how to dispose of waste from coal-fired power plants to new requirements for passenger vehicles, the drumbeat has felt almost non-stop. On Thursday, the EPA announced the biggest measure yet: new greenhouse gas emissions standards for power plants that run on coal and natural gas. The move will create new requirements for new gas-fired power plants, as well as some natural gas and coal-fired plants already in operation. The outcome, the Biden Administration hopes, is that the rule will lay the groundwork for an electric grid powered entirely by clean power by 2035. \u201cThe President\u2019s \u2018100% by 2035\u2019 goal for the power sector [has] been the north star that has guided policy,\u201d said Ali Zaidi, President Biden\u2019s national climate advisor, ahead of the announcement. \u201cAnd part of that approach is setting rules of the road that can help facilitate and reinforce that shift.\u201d On its own the rule is significant. But the rule is also designed as a crown jewel of sorts, the anchor of a much bigger set of rules and regulations. To understand its significance, it\u2019s important to look at it as part of that bigger picture. Biden entered office with a promise to put climate at the center of his national agenda, and it was clear from the beginning that he viewed the private sector as critical to that goal. His top climate officials hit the road almost immediately to engage with industry, and the Administration quickly embraced public-private partnerships aimed at cutting emissions. His international climate agenda, too, focused on catalyzing private finance. Most importantly, his central legislative effort, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), focused almost entirely on positive incentives to encourage industry rather than penalties, proverbial carrots rather than sticks. EPA Administrator Michael Regan described his goal to me last summer as using regulation to create \u201crules of the road\u201d rather than penalizing industry. \u201cThis is not a hostage negotiation,\u201d he told me. \u201cThis is a conversation about how we\u2019re all going to win the future.\u201d Regan told me that, in the past, companies have viewed the drumbeat of EPA regulations as \u201cdeath by 1,000 paper cuts.\u201d He wanted to present the power sector with \u201ca suite of regulations\u201d in quick succession, he said. \u201cThe power sector then can take a look at the economics to comply with those rules at one time, or they can say \u2018hey, to hell with the past, let\u2019s invest more quickly in the future.\u2019\u201d Taking such an approach with power plant rules was always going to be challenging. Power plant regulation has been a source of tension between industry and the federal government ever since the Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that the EPA needed to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Since then, successive administrations have tried and failed to write rules that would stand up to legal scrutiny\u2014often due to intense blowback from industry. The attempt to win over power companies is evident in the final language of the rule announced this week. While the rule will clearly push some coal-fired power plants to close early and impose new costs on the construction of new natural gas plants, it goes to lengths to ease the transition for industry. Companies face less stringent standards for existing plants that will retire before 2035 compared to 2040, as well as for plants that are designed to operate less frequently. And the companies that do choose to install carbon capture technology to meet the standards will benefit from tax incentives in the IRA, helping them stomach the cost. Many regulated companies will of course continue to complain about the regulations\u2014and indeed many corporate executives are skeptical of the new power plant rules. But it\u2019s hard to deny that the Administration has tried to engage companies. The Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor owned utilities, issued a carefully parsed statement on the new rule, delaying judgment but thanking the Administration for working closely with industry as it formulated them. \u201cThey\u2019ve been great partners with us,\u201d Pedro Pizarro, the CEO of Edison International, which provides electricity for 15 million in Southern California, told me last fall. \u201cWe really appreciate that.\u201d Those compromises seem to have worked, as many companies are responding to the array of nudges\u2014and not just in the power sector but across the economy. The IRA has driven a spike in investment in U.S.-based clean technology manufacturing even as the Administration is still putting the finishing touches on how to implement and disburse money under that law. And a Deloitte survey from earlier this year found that 65% of C-suite officers had increased their climate action in response to the changing regulatory climate. Some activists will complain that the Administration\u2019s approach to climate\u2014including with this regulation\u2014has been too business friendly. But, without Democratic control of Congress and with a Supreme Court that has severely limited the ability of agencies to maneuver, options are limited.",

        "title": "Inside Ukraine's Push to Try Putin For War Crimes",
        "content": "In the office of Andriy Smyrnov, the deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration, the wanted posters spread across the desk serve as a kind of mission statement. They show the faces of five Russian officials, led by President Vladimir Putin, next to a list of the charges Ukraine has leveled against them: aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity. \u201cWe had these printed as a reminder,\u201d Smyrnov says while pacing around his desk on the third floor of the presidential compound, one floor down from the chambers of his boss, President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cThere\u2019s no alternative to putting Putin on trial,\u201d he says. The question is where, and under whose authority. As the top aide to Zelensky on judicial matters, Smyrnov, 42, has spent the past year charting a path to an improbable destination: a courtroom, somewhere, with Putin in the dock. Every step has been painstaking, with Ukraine\u2019s closest allies often blocking the way. But Smyrnov, who has no experience in international law, has made surprising progress. Last fall, he says, \u201cNobody even wanted to talk to us about a tribunal. Now look at how quickly the civilized world is waking up.\u201d On March 16, investigators working with the UN Human Rights Office reported that Russian forces committed crimes against humanity, a rare rebuke from a UN body against a sitting member of the UN Security Council. The following day, the International Criminal Court in The Hague (ICC) issued a warrant for Putin\u2019s arrest, charging him in connection with another alleged war crime: the mass deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. Less than two weeks after that, the U.S. set out a plan to put Putin on trial for the crime of aggression, which some scholars describe as the root of all war crimes. None of these developments are likely to achieve justice as Zelensky, Smyrnov, and their team have envisioned it. The ICC\u2019s warrant will be toothless unless Putin travels to a country willing to arrest him, and the U.S. plan for an \u201cinternationalized national court\u201d remains vague; some legal experts say it would be easy for Putin to sidestep or ignore. But it all feels like a breakthrough to Smyrnov and his colleagues. \u201cWhen it came to creating a tribunal,\u201d he says, \u201cthere were a lot of issues on the agenda that seemed unattainable half a year ago. In reality, they were well within reach.\u201d Before the invasion, Smyrnov\u2019s role in the presidential headquarters mostly involved pushing paper. He worked on judicial reforms and helped prepare documents for Zelensky\u2019s signature. A lot of that changed on the morning of Feb. 24, 2022, when Russian missiles began raining down on cities across Ukraine. Holed up in their bunker beneath the presidential compound, Zelensky and his aides realized that their judicial system could soon be hijacked. If the Russians seized control of the courts, they could begin issuing legal decisions that would undermine Zelensky\u2019s authority or legitimize the puppet government that Moscow wanted to install in his place. To prevent that, Smyrnov rushed to the server room of a Kyiv courthouse and, with help from an officer of Ukraine\u2019s security services, broke through the door. Once inside, they unplugged the court\u2019s internal computer network\u2014the judicial equivalent of blowing up a bridge to thwart the advance of enemy tanks. \u201cIn terms of separation of powers, that\u2019s probably not what you should do,\u201d he says, pulling up photos he took that day of the courthouse servers, their wires ripped out and dangling. \u201cBut these were extraordinary times.\u201d By early April, the President\u2019s legal department shifted to a new challenge. The Russian military\u2019s retreat from the Kyiv region exposed gruesome atrocities in places they had occupied. The streets of Bucha, a suburb of the capital, were littered with the bodies of dozens of civilians; hundreds more were later found in mass graves around town. In the wake of that massacre, Zelensky\u2019s calls for justice intensified.\u201cAccountability must be inevitable,\u201d he told the UN on April 5, 2022, the day after he saw the evidence of war crimes in Bucha for himself. Under international law, the Security Council can create a tribunal to prosecute war crimes, as it did after the wars in Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s. But that would not work in the case of Ukraine, because Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, holds a veto over all its rulings. As they looked for an alternative, Smyrnov and his team found themselves studying the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals and reviewing evidence from crime scenes and mass graves around Ukraine. \u201cI used to get a kick out of horror movies,\u201d Smyrnov says. \u201cBut after some of the things I\u2019ve seen, after some of the exhumation reports, any horror movie feels like a joke.\u201d Ukrainian investigators have received nearly 80,000 reports of war crimes and opened thousands of cases against Russian military personnel accused of committing them. But when it comes to prosecuting Putin, Smyrnov and his team discovered, Ukrainian courts do not have the authority. It would take an internationally authorized tribunal to overcome the legal immunity Putin enjoys as a sitting head of state, says David Scheffer, a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes. At first, the ICC in The Hague seemed like a logical venue. But unlike 123 other countries, Ukraine and Russia never ratified the treaty that created the ICC in 1998. Neither did the United States. President Trump even sanctioned the ICC leadership in June 2020 for their attempts to investigate the use of torture in Afghanistan. The Ukrainians decided to push instead for the creation of an ad hoc tribunal focused on holding Russia\u2019s leadership responsible for the crime of aggression, which the Rome Statute defines as a war crime. \u201cIn this whole gruesome story, the decision to start the war is the original crime,\u201d says Christian Wenaweser, Liechtenstein\u2019s ambassador to the UN. \u201cIt\u2019s the crime of the leadership, the ones who ordered the invasion, and we need to have a mechanism to prosecute them for it.\u201d But who would give authority to such a tribunal? Ukraine decided to seek it from the 193 member states of the UN General Assembly; unlike the 15-member Security Council, Russia holds no veto there. Through the spring and summer of 2022, Smyrnov and his colleagues appealed to dozens of foreign countries and international institutions for support. But the talks were often frustrating. Prosecuting the crime of aggression tends to appeal to its victims, like Ukraine, and to smaller countries like Liechtenstein, which does not have a military. The U.S. and other big powers see less advantage in letting foreign courts judge their decisions on when to make war. Behind closed doors, U.S. diplomats warned Ukrainian officials that a tribunal could hinder Washington\u2019s ability to reach Putin in an emergency\u2014if, for instance, the war escalated into a nuclear standoff, two of the officials said. Others said that it could prolong the war by impeding peace talks. One European official even told his Ukrainian counterparts the tribunal could only be fair and balanced if it included a Russian judge. Smyrnov found it hard to respond to such arguments without losing his temper. As the evidence of Russian atrocities piled up in agonizing detail, he often fell back on sarcasm. \u201cLet\u2019s just write Putin a greeting card and say, Dude, you\u2019re awesome. We bow our heads. We won\u2019t judge you for your crimes of aggression,\u201d Smyrnov says between pulls on a vape, summarizing a point he has often made to foreign officials. \u201cOr how about we stop being afraid,\u201d he says. \u201cHow about we team up and hold him accountable.\u201d By September, the effort reached what he calls \u201ca psychological plateau.\u201d European institutions and parliamentary assemblies had backed the idea of a tribunal. But with heads of state, Smyrnov says, \u201cwe reached the limits of our ability to communicate.\u201d The lawyers asked Zelensky to step up the pressure, and he pushed harder for a tribunal in his talks with foreign leaders. As Ukraine made gains on the battlefield, the prospect of holding Russia to account became easier to imagine. In January, the European Parliament voted 472 to 19 to support a tribunal\u2019s creation. The vote was symbolic, but it gave Kyiv hope that momentum might turn its way at the UN General Assembly, where Ukraine could count on only a few dozen votes. Russia\u2019s influence there was one obstacle. But support from the U.S. was also far from certain. In December 2022, Congress authorized the U.S. to aid \u201cinvestigations and prosecutions\u201d related to the war in Ukraine. Yet the Pentagon raised objections, concerned about setting a precedent that could put U.S. officials in legal jeopardy. (A decision whether to give intelligence to the ICC for its case against Putin is due to come before President Biden soon, according to the New York Times.) At the end of March, Smyrnov\u2019s goal of an ad hoc tribunal seemed to get a boost from the Biden Administration. In a speech on March 27, America\u2019s ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaack, said the U.S. would endorse an \u201cinternationalized national court\u201d that Ukraine could establish with support from the U.S. and its allies, not the UN. \u201cThis kind of model,\u201d she said, would \u201cdemonstrate Ukraine\u2019s leadership in ensuring accountability for the crime of aggression.\u201d To some legal scholars, the approach looked deeply flawed, as it would still allow Putin to claim immunity as a sitting head of state. \u201cUnfortunately it plays into Putin\u2019s hands,\u201d says Scheffer, who held the same post as Van Schaack during the Clinton Administration. \u201cPutin and his colleagues can ignore the prospect of prosecution for the crime of aggression.\u201d Skeptics view the move as an attempt by Washington to derail the prospect of a UN-authorized tribunal. But Ukraine sees it as another step on the road to justice. A few months ago, Smyrnov says, the U.S. opposed any tribunal that would hold Russian leaders accountable. The Ukrainians have not given up on the hope of a resolution in the UN General Assembly that would empower a tribunal under international law, and they plan to keep rallying support for such a vote in the months ahead. \u201cWe\u2019ve overcome our fear,\u201d Smyrnov says. \u201cThe rest should be easier.\u201d\u2014With reporting by Julia Zorthian",

        "title": "White Women Must Do More To Confront Racism",
        "content": "In 2019, we decided to host anti-racism events in white women\u2019s dining rooms for one specific reason: To turn the age-old adage, \u201cit\u2019s rude to talk about politics at the dinner table\u201d on its head. This is what we\u2019ve learned\u2014if you don\u2019t talk about racism, you can\u2019t dismantle it. But it isn\u2019t just over the dinner table that this \u201cniceness\u201d rules. In the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020, you were eager, frenzied even, to do this work. A mere two years later, not only is that excitement for anti-racism work gone, the pendulum has swung in the other direction, into a verifiable whitelash against anti-racism work. If white womanhood is a house, your need to be perfect is the foundation. It is this need for perfection that makes it impossible to engage in antiracism work. Being perfect is the key to your happiness, to your success, to your very existence. Perfect hair. Perfect clothes. Perfect grades. Perfect nails. Perfect weddings. Perfect bodies. Perfect adoring and supportive wife and mother. Perfect employee and colleague. White skin. The foundational principle of perfection in a white supremacist society like ours is rooted in whiteness. Without it, your A\u2019s will never be straight enough, your MVP trophies not shiny enough, your flowery dresses a bit wilted. Of course, white skin alone doesn\u2019t render you perfect, but without it, you have no chance. White skin is a necessary (yet still insufficient) ingredient of perfection. The con, of course, is there is no actual recipe for perfection, as there is no such thing as perfection. Read More: How the \u2018Karen Meme\u2019 Confronts the Violent History of White Womanhood This makes your endless quest for perfection a trap. You will never be pretty enough. You will never be thin enough. You will never be smart enough or successful enough or rich enough. You will never be enough. Yet white women will die trying. Especially over dinner. We call it the \u201cThree Point Plan for Perfectionism.\u201d It goes like this: You\u2019ve been taught generation after generation that talking about politics over a meal is rude. Being rude is the enemy of perfection. Being perfect is your number one life goal, so you will not talk about racism. White women regularly mention having been \u201cburned\u201d on social media for saying the \u201cwrong thing.\u201d You have been publicly humiliated, often at the hands of a fellow white woman, who is angling to show you how much more perfect she is at antiracism work. Yes, you even compete in the antiracism space. Getting called out makes you want to stop the work, to stop engaging. If you aren\u2019t already perfect at it, then you don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. Yet if you stop the work, you can\u2019t make progress. Then there are those situations in which the critique of you is coming from a woman of color. This will hit you in a deeply uncomfortable place. After all, you are not used to having us challenge you\u2014and on a topic we absolutely know more about: being on the receiving end of racism. This, in particular, infuriates white women. Us publicly calling you out on your racism. Us publicly telling you that you are not perfect. Antiracism work depends on your acknowledging your imperfections, namely how you have been born into and nurtured by a white supremacist society. This means acknowledging that you are not the expert on how it feels to be on the receiving end of racism, which means you do not get to decide what is and is not racist. Just like men don\u2019t get to decide what is and is not sexist. It means acknowledging that you will get it wrong, that you will feel embarrassed, and that you will struggle to make progress. In spite of these obstacles and this necessary discomfort, you will have to pick yourself up and get back into the work\u2014work that is messy, not tidy. Work that is tables turned upside down, not neatly set. Work that is imperfect. So, why show up? Why do this work now? Because you must. You\u2019ll do it because not only is it the right thing to do, but you know that your lives, and your kids\u2019 and your grandkids\u2019 lives, depend on your showing up, even when things get hard. You will show up because you understand that white supremacy hurts you too. You are doing this not to save us, but to free yourselves. So the next time you think things like, \u201cI didn\u2019t pipe up on Facebook because I don\u2019t want to be attacked,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to say the wrong thing,\u201d or \u201cThe last time I called someone out at a dinner party, my husband was grumpy with me for a week,\u201d think about this: The only wrong move is remaining silent, sitting on the sidelines, accepting your role in white supremacy. Don\u2019t do nothing out of the fear of doing it imperfectly. Get in there. Read. Listen. Learn. Speak up. Speak out. Show up. Roll up your sleeves. And when you receive criticism, consider that maybe it\u2019s just that: a critique, and not an attack. Maybe this disagreement isn\u2019t a fight. Maybe you don\u2019t know more than the Black, Indigenous, or brown woman attempting to set you straight. And isn\u2019t freedom from white supremacy worth some level of conflict? Isn\u2019t it more important to eradicate racism than to be liked by everybody? You\u2019ve never been liked by everybody in the first place! In the end, you cannot even start the process of extracting white supremacy until you extract the need to be perfect. The need to be perfect is not just harmful to us, it\u2019s harmful to you. Aren\u2019t you tired of never being enough?

        "title": "Racism Is Not a Mental Illness\u2014But It\u2019s Complicated",
        "content": "Everyone knows that Law & Order plotlines are often, as they say, ripped from the headlines. But Dr. Alvin Poussaint, 88, knows this on another level: An emeritus professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, he has had the unusual experience of seeing his ideas incorporated into a season 12 episode of the long-running show. In it, a white working stiff murders a Black CEO in a dispute over a New York City taxicab. When the trial begins, a respected Black psychiatrist takes the stand to present his idea that the defendant suffers from \u201cextreme racism,\u201d a mental illness. His lawyers argue that extreme racism has such a complete hold on the defendant that it mitigates their client\u2019s legal responsibility for the murder. In the final moments, the audience is encouraged to feel that it\u2019s a victory for justice, for law and order, when the jury rejects the psychiatrist\u2019s ideas, Poussaint tells me with a tinge of disdain. In the real world, Poussaint was that psychiatrist. Sort of. While he never brought his ideas to the witness stand inside the New York City courthouse behind those massive stone steps that Law & Order made famous, in 1999 he shared his theories on the link between mental health and extreme forms of bigotry on the op-ed pages of the New York Times. In doing so, he helped set off a debate that ended with the American psychiatric establishment publicly rejecting the concept\u2014partly on the grounds that so many people are racists. But even now, after nearly a decade during which the number of hate crimes has steadily increased, the question of the relationship between bigotry and mental illness has never fully been resolved. In fact, recent high-profile incidents have made public perception of that dynamic perhaps as muddled as ever. The issue comes up in relation to everything from major mass shootings to pop-culture discourse. The racist attack at a Buffalo, N.Y., supermarket, for which the gunman pleaded guilty this week to state murder and domestic terrorism charges, prompted calls for the country to \u201cget serious about mental health\u201d as well as pleas not to talk about the shooting as a matter of psychiatric illness rather than a racist hate crime. Read more: Anti-Black Violence Has Long Been the Most Common American Hate Crime\u2014And We Still Don\u2019t Know the Full Extent It\u2019s hard to distinguish what psychiatric experts have decided not to define, to separate what Poussaint calls \u201ceveryday racism\u201d\u2014covering the span from systemic discrimination to microaggressions\u2014from the extreme version, which he and others have described as the point at which bigotry so deeply shapes behavior that a person struggles to function and sometimes becomes dangerous. But the question is more than just a thought experiment. If extreme racism were to become accepted as a mental illness per se, more suspects in hate-crime cases could potentially have recourse to mount \u201cinsanity\u201d defenses in court. And given all the mass shootings and disturbing public events in which extreme racism appears to have played some part since Poussaint first described his ideas, it\u2019s also hard not to wonder. Might developing a research-backed extreme-racism diagnosis\u2014and sound treatments\u2014have saved lives? Though the FBI typically releases data each fall detailing the prior year\u2019s hate-crimes statistics, the agency has not yet done so in 2022. But social conditions are rife, experts say, for the increase to continue. (In 2020, the most recent year for which FBI data is available, the agency reported 8,263 incidents\u2014an increase of nearly a thousand over the prior year, despite 452 fewer agencies reporting\u2014and most experts believe the real number is higher.) Police have noted that 47 out of 100 people arrested for hate crimes in New York City in early 2022 \u201chave prior documentation of an [emotionally disturbed person] incident.\u201d So the stakes are high for the nation\u2019s courtrooms to respond to the trauma unleashed by that dynamic\u2014and for Americans to decide what constitutes a just outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d says Sander Gilman, a historian at Emory University who researches the relationship between health, science, law, and society, and who has long taught a course on extremism. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to start with two things that I call Gilman\u2019s Law: not all racists are crazy, but crazy people can be racists.\u201d Thanks in part to the influence of pop culture\u2014not least those TV police procedurals\u2014many assume that insanity pleas are common. In reality, mental-health defenses are rare, and even more rarely lead to reduced punishment. Mounting that kind of defense requires time and significant resources to gather evidence and expert testimony, so in practice it is not an avenue available to all defendants. In England and the U.S., courts began to reliably consider the mental health of defendants only in the 19th century. The M\u2019Naghten rule, a standard for determining a defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of a crime, was established in 1840s England. It holds that only the sane can be held responsible for their actions. As a result, the question of mental fitness\u2014sufficient sanity to participate meaningfully in one\u2019s own defense\u2014is sometimes evaluated before a trial. (Whether the state has an obligation or right to treat such an illness in order for the person to then stand trial is, Gilman says, a question that goes back as far as the idea of such a defense.) Once a competency decision has been made, the accused who do go to trial have the right to a defense. In some cases, that may include an option for a jury to find the defendant not guilty by reason of mental disorder. In others, ideas about the mental health of the defendant may more informally shape what evidence is presented. But so-called \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d defenses are used in only about 1% of cases, says Michael Boucai, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law and an expert on mental health and other social issues in courtrooms. Those defenses are successful in even fewer cases; in fact, such a tactic often backfires or results in a defendant confined for a longer term inside a hospital than that person would have spent in prison, sometimes with no end date. And even rarer\u2014though not unheard of\u2014is an attempt to use racism or other bigotry as an indicator of mental-health challenges, he says. \u201cI think it would be extremely hard,\u201d says Boucai, \u201cI mean extremely hard, to succeed on the theory that extreme racism per se\u2014particularly subscription to a theory\u2014is a mental illness for the purpose of criminal responsibility. Just because you have a psychologist or psychiatrist saying this person is mentally ill does not mean the law has to [accept] that.\u201d (Nor does the defendant: Dylann Roof, the white man who shot and killed nine Black worshippers inside a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015\u2014whose legal team used words like \u201cdelusional,\u201d \u201cabnormal,\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d to describe their client\u2014rejected advice from his lawyers to attempt to avoid the death penalty by allowing them to argue that he was insane or suffering from a mental defect at the time of the shooting.) Some fear that raising mental-health issues in court runs the risk of bolstering inaccurate myths about the mentally ill. In reality, mentally ill people are disproportionately more likely to become the victims of crime, and most do nothing to victimize others. And, as has been observed after so many headlinemaking crimes, suspects from privileged groups are more likely to have their actions described as illness in need of treatment instead of criminal evil meriting punishment. Some experts fear that shifting the conversation to questions of mental health can also draw attention away from hateful ideas embraced by the person accused of the crime\u2014ideas that are today often shared by people, including public figures, whose mental health is not questioned. That\u2019s how important social problems that require the nation\u2019s attention are transformed into one individual\u2019s medical problems, says W. Carson Byrd, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. Column: We Need to Take Action to Address the Mental Health Crisis in This Pandemic That line of thinking is particularly problematic in a culture prone to dismiss the need for systemwide reforms to address inequality, Byrd says. It can foster an emphasis on quick fixes for the world\u2019s long-standing problems with bigotry. (In 2012, for example, a team of British researchers announced that an existing heart and blood-pressure drug appeared to reduce implicit bias after a study involving just 36 subjects.) \u201cWhite supremacy is a very normal part of society,\u201d says Byrd, who is also the faculty director of research initiatives at his university\u2019s National Center for Institutional Diversity. It is not a good or productive part of society, he points out, but a deeply entrenched one. \u201cOne of the detriments of trying to look at racism as a form of psychopathology or mental illness is that it makes that [illness] abhorrent, as if everything else is working in a certain [non-racist] way.\u201d Research has also long shown that bigotry is not an inborn human trait, but rather something learned from our environments, Byrd says. While racism can influence one\u2019s mental health, describing racism itself\u2014even \u201cextreme racism\u201d\u2014as a mental illness implies that bigotry exists beyond our individual and collective control. \u201cBy medicalizing [extreme racism], making it something curable, a mental-health disorder, it pulls away from having those broader conversations about how society is impacting people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just try to figure out, \u2018How do we fix this one person?\u2019\u201d This problem, Boucai notes, can already be clearly seen in discussions about gun crime, and mass shootings in particular: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to understand these crimes and the discourse of insanity provides one way to do it,\u201d says Boucai. \u201cBut I think we can see where that sort of language is irresponsible and potentially undermines a just result.\u201d In other words, if a mass shooter is simply insane, then wholesale gun-law reform can, to some, seem unnecessary, even unwise. When bigotry is involved, that supposed insanity might, some who oppose Poussaint\u2019s ideas believe, undermine systemwide efforts toward equity\u2014or at least toward greater safety for those most likely to be targeted. In 1999, when Poussaint wrote his op-ed advocating for increased research into possible psychiatric treatments for extreme racism, he was the author of acclaimed books about the effects of racism on Black mental health and a veteran of public controversy. Years earlier he\u2019d argued publicly that racial pride among Black Americans could be taken to an unhealthy extreme. By the 1990s, he may have been best known for his work with Bill Cosby, consulting on scripts for The Cosby Show in a massively popular effort to disrupt stereotypes. Poussaint first published his ideas about extreme racism weeks after a man named Buford O. Furrow Jr. shot and seriously injured four children and an adult inside a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, then shot and killed a nearby Asian-American postal worker. When captured and ultimately convicted, Furrow told investigators his actions had been motivated by hate. Reporters unearthed information indicating that Furrow had close relationships with known white nationalists, and also that he had been evaluated by Washington State\u2019s mental-health system only months before the attack. He\u2019d even told officials after a previous arrest for assault that he\u2019d \u201cfantasized,\u201d about mass murder. To Poussaint, this story signaled a growing threat posed by a failure to recognize that, while highlighting and combating systemic racism is important in preventing discrimination, so is identifying and helping individuals motivated by bigotry who might go so far as to injure or kill others. Read more: 11 People Were Killed in 48 Hours in Mass Shootings Across America. It\u2019s Likely to Get Worse The idea had been brewing for years. In 1993, a Jamaican immigrant named Colin Ferguson had shot and killed six people and injured 19 aboard a New York commuter train after years of personal struggles that he blamed on white and Asian people, whom he referred to as \u201cdevils.\u201d Ferguson had been pinned down by passengers on the train to stop the shooting but, while defending himself at trial, he argued that someone else committed the crime. (Ferguson\u2019s lawyers had planned to argue that he was insane at the time, suffering from something called \u201cBlack rage,\u201d another condition debated but not officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and that was the subject of a Law & Order episode.) After the train shootings, Poussaint\u2014a Haitian-American son of immigrants\u2014had noted Ferguson\u2019s trajectory: racist thinking, delusions that had come to dominate his life, then mass violence. This was a textbook case of extreme racism. \u201cExtreme racism crosses the line and is out of control,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust like somebody can have a little bit of anxiety, but if they have anxiety to the point that it is immobilizing, then it is a mental disorder.\u201d Mass shooters behind hate crimes are, as he sees it, in a similar state: \u201c[They] weren\u2019t functioning individuals. They were impaired by their mental pathology.\u201d When the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the guide that mental-health professionals use to make their diagnoses, was published in 1980, clinicians like Poussaint considered racism\u2014not extreme racism, but what he calls everyday racism\u2014a potential symptom of several conditions, from paranoid personality disorder to generalized anxiety disorder. Racism alone is not sufficient to diagnose a patient with one of those conditions, but an extreme racist, Poussaint says, likely suffers from delusions. Such people live with multiple symptoms including paranoia; they are likely to project negative traits or outcomes onto entire groups and sustain those beliefs even in the face of strong countervailing evidence. Many embrace conspiracy theories. Some may grow violent. In fact, Poussaint argued in a 2002 Western Journal of Medicine article, the extreme racist often begins with \u201cverbal expression of antagonism, progresses to avoidance of members of disliked groups, then to active discrimination against them, to physical attack, and finally to extermination (lynchings, massacres, genocide). That fifth point on the scale, the acting out of extermination fantasies, is readily classifiable as delusional behavior.\u201d Poussaint was not the first person to raise the idea that extreme racism is itself a mental illness. But he was among those leading the call for the American Psychiatric Association, publishers of the DSM, to consider putting it in subsequent editions of the manual, which has a long history of evolving, often slowly, in response to research and norms. When his op-ed ran, it seemed to Poussaint, people pounced. Some of his fellow Black psychiatrists argued that such a diagnosis would unleash a wave of legal excuse-making, helping no one but the violent racists themselves. Poussaint counters that other health diagnoses have yet\u2014nearly 200 years after psychological concerns officially entered American courtrooms\u2014to produce rafts of acquittals. And some clinicians and researchers argued that there are other ways of attacking racism besides treating it as an illness\u2014educational programs, diversity initiatives, policy changes. That\u2019s a point Poussaint says he doesn\u2019t oppose, at least when it comes to everyday racism. Those steps can help racists who embrace repugnant ideas while remaining functional parts of society. But those aren\u2019t the people he\u2019s talking about. \u201cRacism negatively impacts public health,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association told TIME in a statement. \u201cThe American Psychiatric Association has been focusing on this in the DSM by identifying and addressing the impact of structural racism on the over- or underdiagnosis of mental disorders in certain ethno-racial groups. From time to time we have received proposals to create a diagnosis of extreme racism but they have not met the criteria identified for creating new disorders.\u201d To this day, Poussaint believes that extreme racism is very likely its own disorder in need of study, possible diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment, he told me in September from his home in Massachusetts. But after retiring about 2\u00bd years ago at the age of 86, he says he\u2019s too far out of the professional mix to continue to push for an extreme racism diagnosis. I ask Poussaint what he thinks might have happened if extreme racism had become its own diagnosable condition listed in the DSM. Extreme racism might have been a topic on talk shows and a more frequent topic of news coverage, he says. With research and public information campaigns, the need for intervention could have been as clear as it is for heart attacks; the steps to do so as well-known as CPR. \u201cWe\u2019d get away from treating it as if [extreme racism] is normative,\u201d Poussaint says, \u201clike a cultural difference because America is a racist country. We have made it normative by not calling it what it is. Even people in general society, friends and relatives and even the afflicted individual, would recognize it as a disorder and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alright.\u2019 People who get swept up by anxiety and can\u2019t function, they don\u2019t think they are normal. They say, \u2018This is taking over my life. I need some help.\u2019 [A diagnosis] clues the family to say, \u2018This person is really troubled and we have to get them some help.\u2019\u201d \u2014with reporting by Solcyre Burga, Mariah Espada and Simmone Shah",

        "title": "EPA Power Emissions Rule Hinges on Carbon Capture Tech",
        "content": "Acertain irony has threaded its way through the endless rulemaking filings, legal challenges, and political vicissitudes of the decades-long fight to stop U.S. fossil fuel power plants from spewing carbon dioxide emissions into the air. A recent example is last year\u2019s Supreme Court West Virginia v E.P.A. ruling. At the time, it was widely seen as a serious blow to the Biden Administration\u2019s ambitions to cut power sector emissions. Now, the agency is using the parameters set by that ruling to pound an industry responsible for 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions once more. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling blocked the EPA from forcing power sector emitters to switch to clean energy, saying instead the agency could only mandate emissions cuts based on technology that could be deployed \u201cwithin the fenceline\u201d of power facilities themselves. This morning, the EPA unveiled a new rule that would do just that, requiring most coal and natural gas power plants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040. Where the previous mandates were based on so-called \u201cgeneration shifting\u201d as the best available means of power plants reducing emissions\u2014i.e. shutting down and building renewables instead\u2014the new emission reduction rules are based on the capabilities of technology such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) that companies could deploy on the grounds of their power facilities themselves. So, last year\u2019s setback is now something of a legal backing for the EPA\u2019s new position. After all, the Supreme Court has reiterated that mandating emissions cuts based on what power plants can do on-site falls squarely within the agency\u2019s purview. Still, today\u2019s rule doesn\u2019t actually mandate what solutions power companies should use. They could use CCS or burn hydrogen in former natural gas plants, which are some of the options that the new standards are based on\u2014though those options are likely to be much more costly than generation shifting. And if power producers happen to think that setting up multimillion dollar systems to filter out thousands of tons of carbon dioxide is too expensive of a hassle, they always have the option to shut down those coal or natural gas power plants and switch to cheaper, cleaner solar or wind energy. \u201cThe EPA will have a strong argument that carbon capture technology is something that can be implemented by or at a facility and within the fence line,\u201d says Ethan Shenkman, a partner at law firm Arnold and Porter and former EPA deputy general counsel under the Obama Administration. Still, he says, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re home free,\u201d since there\u2019s other ways that litigants could try to prove that the agency exceeded its authority in these new emissions regulations. Read more: The Inflation Reduction Act Includes a Bonanza for the Carbon Capture Industry Another recent irony is that it\u2019s the supposed capabilities of carbon capture technology, long championed by the fossil fuel industry and distrusted by environmentalists, that\u2019s now being used as a cudgel against the owners of coal and natural gas power plants. And the prospect of such regulation has led to some interesting mixed messages on the actual readiness of the technology from some fossil fuel players. Utility National Grid, for instance, says in its net zero plan that it might not shut down all its natural gas plants by 2050, but that that\u2019s alright because it\u2019ll use CCS to suck out their CO2 emissions from smokestacks and bury them underground. Some environmentalists might see that as a hand-wavy promise of using as-yet unproven tech to justify continued investments in natural gas. But according to National Grid, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable. As the company writes on its website, the technology has \u201ctraditionally been viewed as expensive and unpractical at scale. This is changing, however, as investment and research into carbon capturing technologies takes off.\u201d Yet, as it became clear the EPA might begin basing emissions standards on the fact that it was feasible to use such technology, lawyers representing National Grid took a very different line. Last June, a coalition of power companies that included National Grid submitted comments to an EPA white paper on CCS, saying that the power companies\u2019 work in CCS technology gave them \u201cparticular insight into the low likelihood that CCUS [carbon capture, utilization, and storage] will be sufficiently developed to be considered as a viable CO2 control technology in forthcoming proposed rules under Clean Air Act Section 111.\u201d National Grid distanced itself from the group\u2019s comments in an email to TIME. \u201cComments like these are based on consensus and not a perfect representation of company views,\u201d a company representative wrote, adding that they support CCS \u201cwhen it is technologically and economically viable.\u201d Others see things differently. \u201cThis technology has been held up by industry as a way to continue to use fossil fuels for electric power generation and meet whatever emission reductions goals they\u2019ve set,\u201d says Lissa Lynch, the director of the federal legal group at the Natural Resource Defense Council\u2019s climate and clean energy program. \u201cNow that they\u2019re being called on it, they are claiming that it\u2019s too speculative, too far in the future, too expensive, too difficult.\u201d The question of whether CCS technology is feasible and relatively affordable could be of crucial significance in an expected slew of legal challenges to the EPA\u2019s rule once it is finalized. Plaintiffs may try to prove that the agency has exceeded its authority under the Clean Air Act by drafting emissions reduction requirements based on technology they can\u2019t realistically use. The industry might also target the EPA\u2019s slow permitting process in lawsuits. To fully implement CCS technology, power companies need to build special wells where they can store the carbon they captured. Some fossil fuel advocates have already begun pointing to the EPA\u2019s permitting backlog for these wells to argue the agency isn\u2019t doing enough to allow companies to actually implement the technology. \u201cThe very same agency that is pushing the rule out saying that the industry should rely on CCS to meet these targets, is slow walking the permitting process,\u201d says Tom Pyle, president of the pro-fossil fuel American Energy Alliance. To counter these arguments, the EPA may end up trying to prove that CCS is viable. Shenkman says the agency will likely start permitting a lot of wellheads for carbon capture. Recent government action, like federal funds being funneled towards CCS demonstration projects, as well as the huge new tax credits for storing carbon that Congress passed in last summer\u2019s climate bill, could also be a significant boon to the EPA\u2019s argument. Those developments, says Jessie Stolark, director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, have made a huge difference in the prospects for using the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s really a sea change,\u201d she says. More broadly, the EPA has the right and obligation to use regulations to force CCS development along, just as it did in previous mandates for power plants to filter out other pollutants, according to Lynch. The technology has to be feasible\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s available at the hardware store. \u201cEvery single time, industry claims that it\u2019s going to be impossible, and then when standards are in place, industry innovates and comes up with better, faster, cheaper ways of reducing pollution,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cBut there\u2019s no incentive to do any of that innovation until those standards are in place.\u201d Correction, May 11 The original version of this story misstated the name of the Natural Resources Defense Council. It is the Natural Resources Defense Council, not the National Resources Defense Council.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been in dance therapy for all of 90 seconds when I embarrass myself. The group is doing a follow-the-leader exercise, with one person picking a dance move that everyone else must mimic. When my name is called, I panic and launch into an extremely uncool move that could be generously described as disco-inspired, my cheeks flaming as a group of strangers mirror it back at me. I\u2019d traveled to the University of Colorado\u2019s School of Medicine to take this humiliating stab at vulnerability in the name of science (and my own sanity). The Colorado Resiliency Arts Lab (CORAL), an ongoing research project at the school, aims to help people who are burned out from their jobs build resilience and improve their mental well-being. For three months, participants meet weekly for 90-minute sessions that weave together therapy, community, and art to provide an outlet for the stressors of working in health care. But this week, the group includes one participant who doesn\u2019t work in health care: me, a health journalist with a personal interest in whether CORAL\u2019s program really works. After writing about the pandemic for three years, I had started seeing in myself some of the warning signs of burnout, as compiled by Christina Maslach, who has researched burnout for four decades: emotional and mental exhaustion, feeling negative or cynical about work, and believing your work doesn\u2019t matter or your efforts aren\u2019t enough. Tick, tick, and tick. Toward the end of 2022, I experienced significant writer\u2019s block for the first time. The \u201cquiet quitting\u201d trend\u2014doing the bare minimum at work\u2014spoke to me more than it should have. And as the world forgot about COVID-19, I sometimes wondered if there was any point in continuing to cover it. I genuinely love my job, so I wanted to fix those issues before they got worse. But when I asked Dr. Google \u201chow to cure burnout,\u201d I couldn\u2019t find much. That\u2019s because it\u2019s not totally up to me, Maslach says. Fixing burnout is truly possible only when employers eliminate the conditions that produce it in the first place and pare down workloads, support and listen to employees, and give people control over their work and time, Maslach told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not that coping is not important,\u201d she says. But if we see it as the solution, we\u2019re blaming workers and \u201cnot actually changing the stressors themselves.\u201d Read More: Ambition Is Out But what if the stressors don\u2019t change, no matter how much we want them to? In an ideal world, sure, every boss would want to eliminate burnout. But businesses are driven by profits, employees are often told to do more with less, and too many people scrape by on minimum wage and no benefits. Leaving workers responsible for their own burnout may not be the answer, but in many cases, waiting for work to change feels like an equally hopeless path. Is there anything I\u2014and the 42% of office workers who said they felt burned out in a late-2022 survey\u2014could do to make an imperfect situation better? I turned to the scientific literature for answers. Plenty of researchers have looked for ways that individuals can ease their burnout, but many don\u2019t seem to work. A 2022 research review analyzed 30 previous studies on burnout interventions for doctors. Many of the programs\u2014free food, subsidized gym memberships, weekly meetings with a psychologist\u2014didn\u2019t yield significant results. Nearly all of those that did involved a group element, like wellness classes or mentorship programs. That makes sense, even though it\u2019s harder to DIY; other research also suggests social support can improve mental health and protect against burnout. But some individual interventions make a difference. Studies suggest physical activity, a proven mood booster and stress reducer, can decrease burnout. Mindfulness practices such as meditation and yoga have been shown in some, but not all, studies to help, apparently by building resilience and improving emotional regulation. Creativity practices may also chip away at burnout by reigniting passions and facilitating \u201cflow,\u201d or being engrossed in a task. So: socializing, exercise, meditation, and arts and crafts. Not exactly groundbreaking stuff. The first three are foundational aspects of good health, recommended by nearly every expert I\u2019ve ever interviewed. Despite how familiar they felt, I used them as the protocol for my highly unscientific burnout-busting experiment: I\u2019d work out at least three times a week and do yoga at least once a week, meditate daily, and complete a daily creativity exercise. (I chose to doodle my emotions.) Since my experiment coincided with TIME\u2019s return-to-office plans\u2014mandating my presence in the office three days a week\u2014I figured I\u2019d get my workplace social-interaction fix whether I liked it or not. As a longtime gymgoer, I also found my exercise quota manageable. The idea of meditating and doodling, however, filled me with dread. The most in touch I\u2019ve ever been with my artsy side was when I started painting by numbers during the desperate boredom of lockdown. And you know how mindfulness experts often say there\u2019s no wrong way to meditate? They\u2019ve never been inside my anxious brain as it ping-pongs from what to make for dinner to whether I forgot to feed the cat to an awkward thing I said six years ago. But\u2014at least at the beginning\u2014I was committed. Read More: Long Waits, Short Appointments, Huge Bills: U.S. Health Care Is Causing Patient Burnout Socializing at work was by far the easiest part. I found it energizing and soul-nourishing to see co-workers face-to-face, even if we mostly chatted about bad Keurig coffee and reality television. I also felt virtuous about taking leisurely lunch breaks with colleagues. However, adding in a long commute made every other element of my plan harder. Exercising four times a week became a scheduling headache. Meditating and drawing fell even lower down my priority list. Sometimes I listened to a guided meditation during my subway ride home, which was futile. And on more than one occasion, I actually said the words \u201cUgh, I still have to doodle,\u201d out loud to my fianc\u00e9 at the end of the day. Exercise, at least, reliably lifted my mood and eased my stress when I managed to squeeze it in. But meditating often felt more boring than centering, and I frequently stared down at a blank page in my notebook, wondering what the heck my emotions looked like. Katina Bajaj, a clinical psychology researcher who launched a startup aimed at using creativity to bust burnout, was the one who suggested my daily doodling. The instructions she sent recommended starting by \u201cdrawing repetitive lines, dots, shapes or blocks, and notic[ing] how your mind begins to create more space.\u201d I tried\u2014I really did. But doodling and deep breathing didn\u2019t cancel out the drains of deadline pressures, rude emails, and constant bad news. If anything, my regimen made it clear that adding to my to-do list made my stress worse. My experiment had failed. Which brought me to the dance circle at the University of Colorado. The burnout study there had the extreme misfortune of trying to launch in March 2020, just as the U.S. was shutting down. Dr. Marc Moss, a critical-care physician and CORAL\u2019s principal investigator, had intended to study burnout reduction among intensive-care providers. But by the time COVID-19 was controlled enough in Colorado to get the program up and running in -September 2020, \u201cthe whole world was stressed out,\u201d Moss says. He and his colleagues decided to open the first few study sessions to any patient\u2013facing health care workers, then broadened the eligibility criteria over time. Now in its sixth round, CORAL welcomes anyone in the Denver area who works in the health care field, from researchers and lab technicians to food\u2013service workers and case managers. When people sign up for CORAL, they\u2019re assigned to a group focusing on visual arts, writing, dance, or music. For 12 weeks, facilitators use creative exercises to help people express their identity and values, channel negative emotions, build resilience, and develop self-care routines. To build community, participants are also encouraged to share experiences from their lives and jobs and take part in a group project, such as contributing a work of art to an album or performing a dance. \u201cWe\u2019re building resilience more than curing burnout,\u201d says Katherine Reed, an art therapist who runs CORAL\u2019s visual-arts group. But the data suggest one leads to the other: for almost 150 health care providers who joined the study from September 2020 to July 2021, the approach led to small but significant decreases in anxiety, depression, and burnout, according to a 2022 study published in the American Journal of Medicine. If the framework proves effective for people in a wider swath of health care jobs, Moss says CORAL\u2019s approach could feasibly be adopted by burned-out workers in any industry. That\u2019s what made me want to try the program. Burnout has been studied extensively among health care workers, but few researchers have looked at interventions for the general public. During my visit in March, I dropped in on the music, writing, and dance groups. (I missed visual art because of a flight delay, because apparently the universe wanted my baseline state to be as stressed as possible.) For three days, I used all of my senses to describe how humor looks, sounds, feels, smells, and tastes; wrote about my emotions as if they were characters in a short story; and practiced vulnerability by dancing in front of strangers. I listened as members of the study talked about frustrating moments in their days, applauding along with everyone else when people described emotional breakthroughs with their bosses or co-workers. Even as an aggressively uncrafty, professionally skeptical person, I felt calm and happy during my time with CORAL\u2014a combination, probably, of getting away from my daily routine, paying attention to my emotions, and trying something new. I was encouraged. But when I asked Moss and his team if the CORAL curriculum could be distilled into something I, or any individual, could do on my own, I was met with a resounding no. The program\u2019s magic, its facilitators said, is in bringing people together to feel the solidarity and community so often lacking in modern life. People can draw or dance or write or sing on their own, but it likely won\u2019t have the same transformative effect without a human connection. Read More: How to Find Your New Favorite Hobby That\u2019s what Dr. Colin West, who researches physician well-being at the Mayo Clinic, found in 2021, when he published a study on what happened when physicians met up for group discussions over meals. Their burnout symptoms improved, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily the food that made the difference\u2014it was support. \u201cWe have so many shared experiences and so many stressors that are in common, and yet physicians will often feel like, Well, I can\u2019t talk to anybody about this,\u201d West says. Bringing people together to share their experiences can help. West believes there are other reasons the program worked: it was easy for people to join, since they had to eat anyway, and the hospital made meals free for study participants. \u201cThe individual needs to contribute something, and the organization needs to contribute something,\u201d West says. That two-sided approach helps people feel supported and valued by their organization, which can go a long way toward easing some of the bitterness and cynicism that accompany burnout. Since my solo study didn\u2019t work, and I couldn\u2019t take off 12 weeks to join CORAL for real, I felt resigned to the relief I\u2019d gained from exercise and my in-person days at the office. But over time, something changed at work. My editor\u2014tipped off to my burnout when I pitched the story you\u2019re reading\u2014encouraged me to take a step back from the COVID-19 news cycle and pursue other topics. As I settled into my less-COVID-centric routine, it felt easier to get excited about pitching ideas and writing stories, and to show up each day feeling more engaged and energized. In a way, my experiment proved that burnout expert Maslach was right all along: the self-care tactics I used on my own were less effective than workplace adjustments. But after visiting CORAL, I believe the solution to burnout isn\u2019t just to sit back and hope employers make the right changes. Moss, the research lead for CORAL, thinks about it like this: a hospital could make administrative tweaks to lighten doctors\u2019 workloads, but it can\u2019t protect them from the death and sadness they see every day. \u201cWe see things that are not normal, and we see a lot of tragedy,\u201d Moss says. \u201cI can\u2019t work in an intensive-care unit and not have that happen.\u201d The stressors baked into other industries might be different or less intense, but they\u2019re present in some form, no matter the job. Maybe it\u2019s obnoxious customers, or exhausting overnight shifts, or bureaucratic red tape; there\u2019s always something. When done right, interventions like the ones used in CORAL can provide communal outlets for the stressors that won\u2019t ever go away. I\u2019m hoping happier health news lands on my desk soon. But in the meantime, I\u2019m pursuing better ways to manage stress and searching for people willing to join me. So long, solo doodling. I\u2019m thinking of joining a book club instead\u2014or maybe a dance class.",

She wasn\u2019t working, she was estranged from her family, and her efforts to get help from the Army had gone nowhere, two longtime friends said.   \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she wrote to Jessica D\u2019Lynn Pyles in a message the friend shared with NBC News. \u201cI\u2019m alone.

Spc. Craig Chamberlain, 23, had \u201cwillfully\u201d disappeared from his unit, according to Army officials at his post, Fort Cavazos. Military authorities have offered few answers about what happened, and friends of Cam Chamberlain, who was in her late 20s, have said they\u2019ve found no solace in the aftermath of her death: There have been no autopsy, no obituary and no funeral.  Officials confirmed her death in a statement May 25. The couple lived off base, and a spokeswoman for the Killeen Police Department referred questions about the case to Fort Cavazos authorities, who put out a statement confirming the death. They didn\u2019t provide details about when or where she died, and her cause and manner of death haven\u2019t been disclosed.  Army investigators launched a criminal probe. A spokeswoman for the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division declined to comment further, citing an ongoing investigation. \u201cI can\u2019t even mourn her death the way family should, because it\u2019s as if she never existed at all now,\u201d said Shandy Eubank, one of the longtime friends. The day after authorities announced that his wife had died, Craig Chamberlain was found in \u201crough shape\u201d in the Killeen area, said his mother, Virginia Chamberlain. In an interview with NBC News, she declined to say where her son is now. A spokeswoman at Fort Cavazos declined to discuss his status in the Army, saying he was the subject of an administrative investigation in connection with his disappearance. The inquiry has been completed but can\u2019t be disclosed because of privacy rules. A quick marriage and an overseas assignment Craig and Cam Chamberlain met a few years ago through a dating app and were married in 2020, according to her Facebook page. Though Eubank believed the couple had rushed things, they initially seemed happy, she said. \u201cThe way he treated her \u2014 he put her on a pedestal,\u201d said Eubank, who met Cam when they worked together at an insurance company in Waco more than a decade ago. \u201cHe treated her better than anyone had treated her.\u201d She was a people person, Eubank said \u2014 someone who was as outspoken as she was happy and goofy.   D\u2019Lynn Pyles said, \u201cYou knew where she stood on things.\u201d In an interview with a Texas newspaper, Cam described her husband as laid back, patient and carefree. He has a unicorn tattooed on the upper part of his right arm, his mother said. Craig Chamberlain was assigned to the 704th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company at Fort Cavazos, formerly known as Fort Hood, one of the largest Army bases in the country, which sits roughly midway between Austin and Waco.  A rift emerged between the couple over time, which Cam attributed partly to difficult family dynamics, Eubank said. Cam publicly identified as a transgender woman and had a rocky relationship with her own family, telling friends that her mother had \u201cdisowned\u201d her, Eubank and D\u2019Lynn Pyles recalled. Efforts to reach Cam Chamberlain\u2019s mother were unsuccessful. Messages left at a phone number listed as her brother\u2019s weren\u2019t returned. Cam told Eubank that she struggled with her husband\u2019s family, as well. Eubank remembered her friend recounting a conversation in which her mother-in-law challenged her ability to be in a loving relationship: \u201cHow can she know she loves Craig when she doesn\u2019t know what gender she is?\u201d  Virginia Chamberlain called the comment \u201cvery, very inaccurate.\u201d \u201cDid we have our differences? Absolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will say I never bullied Cam. I never said a statement like that to Cam. Not once did that ever come out of my mouth.\u201d Craig Chamberlain\u2019s father, Gordon Chamberlain, added that although he hadn\u2019t met Cam before his son married her, \u201cI said we\u2019d treat Cam like anyone else that comes into our lives.\u201d The Army was sending Craig to South Korea, and Cam planned to \u201cstick with him,\u201d Eubank said, despite the growing tension between them. Fort Cavazos officials confirmed he had been ordered to South Korea in December for a long-term assignment.  In a Jan. 8 Facebook post, Cam seemed excited about the trip \u2014 and traveling to other parts of Asia. \u201cCan\u2019t wait for the FOOD,\u201d she wrote in a post that D\u2019Lynn Pyles captured in a screenshot and shared with NBC News. \u201cI love real Asian food.\u201d But months passed, and the couple went nowhere. Then, on March 20, she posted that her husband\u2019s orders had been deferred for six months \u2014 and that she learned so only the night before he was to have left. \u201cYou never know what comes next,\u201d she wrote in another post that D\u2019Lynn Pyles shared. \u201cPlans change faster than this Texas weather.\u201d A spokeswoman for Fort Cavazos declined to comment on the deferment, saying it was part of the base\u2019s administrative investigation.  A missing soldier By the time Cam Chamberlain reported her husband missing \u2014 he had last been seen May 15 \u2014 their relationship had become so \u201ctoxic\u201d that she had planned to split up with him, she told D\u2019Lynn Pyles in a Facebook message. \u201cEven though I\u2019m getting divorced I still can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s in danger,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI still love him and I\u2019d blame myself if anything happened to him.\u201d In other messages to D\u2019Lynn Pyles, she pleaded for money. In one message, she said her husband had refused to pay her their Basic Allowance for Housing, or compensation provided to service members and their families who live off base. \"He went missing and left me with no food. No nothing,\" she said in a message. \"His command won\u2019t help me.\" In a statement, officials at Fort Cavazos didn\u2019t address Cam Chamberlain\u2019s claim. They said that \u201ccaring for our soldiers and families is a top priority.\u201d  \u201cIf soldiers and family members have pay issues that cannot be resolved at the unit level, they should seek help from their unit\u2019s personnel office,\u201d the statement said. In another message, Cam shared a missing person flyer for her husband \u2014 a flyer later circulated by local media that said Craig disappeared without his keys and phone. He\u2019d been suffering from a \u201cbout of extreme depression,\u201d the flyer said. As she searched for her husband, she tracked the sometimes grim responses to his disappearance on social media. In a lengthy comment thread on a local station\u2019s Facebook page, people made jokes about how the base\u2019s name change didn\u2019t prevent another soldier from disappearing and casually suggested his wife may have had something to do with it. In response to a user who said she hoped \u201chis wife\u201d didn\u2019t see the comments, Cam responded: \u201cI have seen them. All of them. And I hope that each and every one of them goes through the pain I am going through.\u201d She also began to talk more about her husband\u2019s disappearance. In a message to D\u2019Lynn Pyles, she said her husband had \u201clied\u201d to her about South Korea. She didn\u2019t offer additional details, but in an interview with the Killeen Daily Herald while Craig was missing, she said Army officials had recently told her that he had stopped reporting to work in March. \u201cHe told me he was going to work the whole time, so I didn\u2019t think anything of it, but in reality, he wasn\u2019t really going to work,\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201cHe was just saying he was going to work.\u201d Virginia Chamberlain cast doubt on her daughter-in-law\u2019s account, saying photos from the time show her son with long hair and a scruffy face. \"You can\u2019t report for duty like that in the Army,\" she said. Officials at Fort Cavazos said in a statement that Craig Chamberlain had \u201cfailed\u201d to travel to his new assignment for \u201cunknown reasons.\u201d A spokeswoman for the base declined to comment when she was asked about the accuracy of Cam Chamberlain\u2019s comments. A plea for help The last time D\u2019Lynn Pyles heard from Cam was May 21, when she sent a Facebook message asking for $40. She\u2019d gone to her mother\u2019s house in Fort Worth \u2014 a place where she said she was \u201cno longer welcome\u201d \u2014 and had spent the last of her money on a ride home to Killeen. D\u2019Lynn Pyles said she couldn\u2019t give her the money \u2014 she\u2019d just gone shopping and had $20 to her name, according to a screenshot of the message. \u201cI totally understand,\u201d her friend responded. Four days later, D\u2019Lynn Pyles messaged Cam \u2014 \u201cAre you good?!\u201d \u2014 and then called. There was no response, and D\u2019Lynn Pyles soon found herself on Facebook groups linked to Fort Cavazos searching for answers. The next day, on May 26, Craig Chamberlain was found alive. It was a week and a half after he had been reported missing and not long after a civilian search party set out with his parents to find him.  Virginia Chamberlain said the group \u2014 made up of \u201ccomplete strangers\u201d \u2014 were \u201cwith us every single day looking for our son.\u201d \"And they were there when we found him,\" she said. \"They are now family to us.\" The base offered few specifics about how or where Craig was found. In a statement, military officials accused him of willfully disappearing and said the search involved the \u201ctremendous efforts and support by the Fort Cavazos and Killeen communities.\u201d Virginia Chamberlain also declined to say where her son was found. She described his path forward as a \u201chard journey\u201d with \u201ca lot of healing to take place.\u201d \"This is a very delicate story,\" she added. \"There\u2019s a lot of lives that have been affected by it. My heart truly does break for Cam\u2019s friends and Cam\u2019s family \u2014 even with the things that have gone on in the past.\" For D\u2019Lynn Pyles, Cam\u2019s death was especially hard given that one of the things her friend had wanted most was a committed partner, someone with whom she could establish the kind of family she didn\u2019t have. \"Craig has been the longest relationship she\u2019d had since I\u2019ve known her,\" D\u2019Lynn Pyles said in a text. \"She was longing for THAT kind of love.\" Now, D\u2019Lynn Pyles added, she just wants the truth about Cam \u2014 \"even if it breaks my heart.\"",

        "title": "Appeals court pauses order limiting Biden admin social media contact",
        "content": "NEW ORLEANS \u2014 A federal appeals court Friday temporarily paused a lower court\u2019s order limiting executive branch officials\u2019 communications with social media companies about controversial online posts. Biden administration lawyers had asked the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to stay the preliminary injunction issued on July 4 by U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty. Doughty himself had rejected a request to put his order on hold pending appeal. Friday\u2019s brief 5th Circuit order put Doughty\u2019s injunction on hold \u201cuntil further orders of the court.\u201d It called for arguments in the case to be scheduled on an expedited basis. Filed last year, the lawsuit claimed the administration, in effect, censored free speech by discussing possible regulatory action the government could take while pressuring companies to remove what it deemed misinformation. COVID-19 vaccines, legal issues involving President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter and election fraud allegations were among the topics spotlighted in the lawsuit. Doughty, nominated to the federal bench by former President Donald Trump, issued an Independence Day order and accompanying reasons that covered more than 160 pages. He said the plaintiffs were likely to win their ongoing lawsuit. His injunction blocked the Department of Health and Human Services, the FBI and multiple other government agencies and administration officials from \u201cencouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech.\u201d Administration lawyers said the order was overly broad and vague, raising questions about what officials can say in conversations with social media companies or in public statements. They said Doughty\u2019s order posed a threat of \u201cgrave\u201d public harm by chilling executive branch efforts to combat online misinformation. Doughty rejected the administration\u2019s request for a stay on Monday, writing: \u201cDefendants argue that the injunction should be stayed because it might interfere with the Government\u2019s ability to continue working with social-media companies to censor Americans\u2019 core political speech on the basis of viewpoint. In other words, the Government seeks a stay of the injunction so that it can continue violating the First Amendment.\u201d In its request that the 5th Circuit issue a stay, administration lawyers said there has been no evidence of threats by the administration. \u201cThe district court identified no evidence suggesting that a threat accompanied any request for the removal of content. Indeed, the order denying the stay \u2014 presumably highlighting the ostensibly strongest evidence \u2014 referred to \u2018a series of public media statements,\u2019\u201d the administration said. Friday\u2019s \u201cadministrative stay\u201d was issued without comment by a panel of three 5th Circuit judges: Carl Stewart, nominated to the court by former President Bill Clinton; James Graves, nominated by former President Barack Obama; and Andrew Oldham, nominated by Trump. A different panel drawn from the court, which has 17 active members, will hear arguments on a longer stay.",

In a news release, the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division cleared Spc. Craig Chamberlain, 23, in the May death of Cam Chamberlain and said her cause and manner of death will be released after an autopsy is completed. The statement, which was released Friday, added that because the investigation is active, no additional details will be released. In a text message Monday, Craig Chamberlain's mother disputed the date of death the Army released for Cam Chamberlain \u2014 May 25 \u2014 and said the Criminal Investigation Division previously told her family it was May 23. An Army spokeswoman could not immediately clarify the discrepancy. Fort Cavazos officials announced the death on May 25. \"I am glad that the truth is coming out and I know that there will be more truth to follow,\" Virginia Chamberlain said in the text. \"We do not know why it has taken so long for this to come to light.\" She called on the Killeen Police Department to release the details surrounding her daughter-in-law's death so \"Cam's loved ones and friends can have closure.\" The police department previously referred questions to the lead agency investigating her death, the Criminal Investigation Division. NBC News reported Thursday that close friends of Cam Chamberlain\u2019s have remained frustrated in the weeks after her death because authorities have released few details about it. \u201cI can\u2019t even mourn her death the way family should, because it\u2019s as if she never existed at all now,\u201d said a friend, Shandy Eubank. Efforts to reach Cam Chamberlain's family have been unsuccessful. Friends of hers have said she was estranged from relatives. Craig Chamberlain, of Fort Cavazos\u2019 704th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Company, went missing May 15 in what the Army described as a \"willful\" disappearance. The base has said he was found May 26. Army officials have declined to provide more details about his status or the disappearance, which was the subject of internal inquiry. A spokeswoman for the base said the Army does not comment on administrative actions. Craig Chamberlain\u2019s mother previously said a civilian search party found him in the Killeen area \u2014 near where Fort Cavazos is located \u2014 in \"rough shape.\" She declined to provide additional details, citing his privacy, but she described his path forward as a \"hard journey\" with \"a lot of healing.\" Craig and Cam Chamberlain were married in October 2020. He was assigned to a new post in South Korea in December, Army officials have said, but for \u201cunknown reasons\u201d he never traveled to the country. In a Facebook message to a friend after Craig Chamberlain went missing, Cam Chamberlain said her husband had lied to her about the assignment, and in an interview with the Killeen Daily Herald she said military officials told her that he stopped reporting to work in March \u2014 though she said he never told her about it. In the days before her death, Cam Chamberlain told friends that her marriage had become \"toxic\" and that she was divorcing her husband.  Eubank said her friend had struggled with her husband and his family partly because of her gender identity. Cam Chamberlain publicly identified as a transgender woman. Virginia Chamberlain has rejected that claim, calling it \u201cvery, very inaccurate.\u201d ",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Kerry Kennedy, a sister of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., lambasted her brother in a brief statement Monday after a report quoted him as saying that Covid-19 was \"targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people\" and that Jewish people are most immune. \"I strongly condemn my brother\u2019s deplorable and untruthful remarks last week about Covid being engineered for ethnic targeting,\" Kerry Kennedy said in a statement released by the nonprofit group Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, where she is president. \"His statements do not represent what I believe or what Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights stand for, with our 50+-year track record of protecting rights and standing against racism and all forms of discrimination,\" she added. On Saturday, the New York Post published an article that included a video that appeared to show Robert Kennedy speaking at a dinner in Manhattan about bioweapons and \"ethnically targeted microbes\" in which he claimed that \"Covid-19 attacks certain races disproportionately.\" \"Covid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese,\" he said, according to the video published by the Post. \"We don\u2019t know whether it was deliberately targeted that or not.\" An overwhelming proportion of American Jews are Ashkenazi Jews, who are descended from Jews who lived in Central and Eastern Europe. NBC News has not verified the video. In a statement on Twitter later in the day, Kennedy defended his remarks, saying they were not antisemitic. Former Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., also weighed in Monday, tweeting that he condemns his uncle's remarks. Robert Kennedy has been repeatedly criticized for pushing conspiracy theories, some about vaccines. Kerry Kennedy, 63, his sister, also blasted her brother, 69, when he launched his presidential bid in April. \"I love my brother Bobby, but I do not share or endorse his opinions on many issues, including the COVID pandemic, vaccinations, and the role of social media platforms in policing false information,\" she said at the time. \"It is also important to note that Bobby\u2019s views are not reflected in or influence the mission or work of our organization.\" Other members of their family have also rebuked him over the conspiracy theories about vaccines and misinformation he has spread for years. At the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denounced the remarks Monday. \"The claims made on that tape is false. It is vile,\" she said at the daily briefing. \"They put our fellow Americans in danger if you think about the racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories that come out of saying those types of things. It's an attack on our fellow citizens, our fellow Americans. So it's important that we speak out.\"",

Our hearts go out to her family and friends during this exceptionally difficult time.\u201d Alhaj-Omar had hoped to have a career helping immigrants who were victims of crime, according to an obituary posted by a Columbus funeral home. \"Amina was a soft and kind soul that demonstrated the utmost compassion and empathy for any person that crossed her path,\" the funeral home said.",

        "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Five major U.S. cities and the  The All Inside initiative will partner the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness and its 19 federal member agencies with state officials in California and local governments in Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Seattle and the Phoenix metro area. The goal is for the federal government to provide \u201cknowledge, resources and elbow grease\u201d to population centers where nearly half the nation\u2019s unhoused residents live, said Susan Rice, President Joe Biden\u2019s domestic policy advisor. The administration will offer \u201ctailored support\u201d for two years to improve efforts toward housing unsheltered people in the participating communities, including embedding a federal official in each area, officials said. In addition, teams will be deployed to help the communities obtain federal funding, establish a network of resources and identify areas where regulations can be loosened and the process for securing housing can be sped up. Philanthropic groups and private businesses will be invited to help identify opportunities for support and collaboration, according to the administration. More than\u00a0580,000 Americans\u00a0were homeless in 2022, with 4 out of 10 of them unsheltered and sleeping on sidewalks and in tents and cars, Rice said. \u201cWe know we cannot meaningfully address our nation\u2019s homelessness problem without a distinct focus on unsheltered homelessness,\u201d she said during a livestreamed announcement with the cities\u2019 mayors and other officials. Agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Social Security Agency, Department of Labor, Federal Emergency Management Agency, will be involved under Thursday\u2019s announcement to help coordinate housing opportunities. Funding specifics were not offered, but the White House said the program will build on the $2.5 billion already allocated to prevent homelessness under the administration\u2019s American Rescue Plan and $486 million in the Department of Housing and Urban Development funding released to local municipalities earlier this year. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass\u00a0said she hoped the initiative would unstick the current bottleneck plaguing her program Inside Safe, which offers homeless people motel rooms and a path to permanent housing with services. The City Council on Thursday passed the mayor\u2019s budget, which provides $250 million for the LA initiative. It has over 1,200 enrollees so far but is moving slowly because of bureaucratic red tape. \u201cIf anything, we know that our current system on the federal, state and county level isn\u2019t designed for the emergency that we are facing today,\u201d Bass, a Democrat, said. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said the White House plan will \u201cunite our systems,\u201d bringing solutions that are effective in some cities to other areas. \u201cWhat\u2019s working in one city will work here because we\u2019re dealing with the same American issues,\u201d Harrell, a Democrat, said. The Seattle area had the nation\u2019s third highest population of homeless residents in 2022, after Los Angeles and New York, at more than 13,300, according to a one-night count required by the federal government. Seattle, King County and nearby cities joined together to launch a regional homelessness authority two years ago. But many officials say the new agency has underperformed, been beset by political fights and had trouble fulfilling administrative duties such as executing contracts with service providers. Meanwhile, the city of Phoenix is under increasing pressure to do something about a massive downtown encampment known as The Zone, where as many as 1,000 unhoused people have congregated near social services. Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, a former social worker, successfully pushed for $150 million to be included in Arizona\u2019s Housing Trust Fund in the state\u2019s budget to shore up rent and utility assistance programs, eviction prevention, and build new shelters and affordable housing. Biden\u2019s\u00a0All In strategy roadmap\u00a0made public last December follows a 2010 effort called Opening Doors, which was the nation\u2019s first comprehensive effort seeking to prevent and end homelessness.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A brewing battle over how to fund the federal government is poised to escalate this week when Congress returns from a two-week recess. The House Republican majority is on a collision course with the Senate as appropriators in both chambers advance conflicting versions of a sweeping package, which must become law by Sept. 30 to prevent a government shutdown. Unlike the House, Senate leaders have moved on a bipartisan path and key senators say they intend to reassert themselves after taking a back seat in the recent debt ceiling negotiations. Yet  Seeking to  Democrats have blasted that as a breach of the agreement. \u201cWhat Speaker McCarthy is doing is increasing the risks of a government shutdown,\u201d said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is charged with writing government funding bills along with its House counterpart. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s a violation of the agreement that Speaker McCarthy struck with the president,\u201d said Van Hollen, who accused McCarthy of \u201ccatering to his very far right\u201d members. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly going to make for some rocky moments.\u201d Top House Republicans, who voted a series of appropriations bills out of committee before the July 4 recess, say they want to redefine how spending agreements are perceived.\u00a0 Granger called the debt ceiling budget agreement \u201ca ceiling, not a floor\u201d for the next round of government funding. \u201cThat is why I will use this opportunity to mark up appropriations bills\" at the lower level that was established in fiscal year 2022. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said House conservatives are trying to right the perceived wrongs of the debt limit battle, including funding levels they believe were too high. \u201cWe have major disagreements with both how, and what, occurred with respect to the debt ceiling increase. So now we\u2019re trying to put the band back together again,\u201d said Roy. In addition to policies going after abortion and LGBTQ rights, House Democrats have criticized other measures that Republicans added to their appropriations bills, including cuts to rural energy funding, a prohibition on military diversity programs and repeal of clean-energy tax breaks under the Inflation Reduction Act. It remains to be seen how firmly McCarthy will insist on the lower spending levels and conservative policy add-ons. Some in the House GOP see it as a first bite at the apple before negotiations with the Senate begin in earnest. Looming over McCarthy is the need to keep his thin majority unified in order to protect his speakership, with ultraconservatives tending to drive the hardest bargain. While House Republicans battle with Democrats, the Senate is taking a different approach in marking legislation at the agreed-to caps and avoiding policies that are poison pills for either party. \u201cIn the Senate, we are working diligently through regular order on a bipartisan basis to advance appropriations bills,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote to colleagues in a Sunday letter outlining a busy July schedule. Senate Appropriations Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Vice Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, issued a joint statement vowing to move \u201cfull steam ahead and in a bipartisan way.\u201d They also vowed to assert the Senate's power, a signal that the funding debate will play out differently than the debt limit bill. \u201cWe are both committed to ensuring that the voice of the Senate is heard through the appropriations process and expect a busy summer of markups and continued bipartisan deliberation,\u201d Murray and Collins said. Murray made it clear the GOP push to fund the military at a higher level while slashing domestic funding was a nonstarter for the Senate. \u201cAs this process continues to move forward, I am going to insist that the programs families depend on every day get the same kind of attention and urgency we constantly see for the Pentagon,\u201d she said at a recent committee meeting when members unanimously approved measures for the military, veterans, agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. McCarthy is  Meeting with service members at Fort Knox last Wednesday, McConnell said the cause represents \u201cthe most important thing going on in the world right now, which is to defeat the Russians in Ukraine.\u201d He said that while some believe the war is not important for the U.S., \u201cthat\u2019s not my view\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cnot the majority view of Republicans in the Senate and Democrats as well.\u201d It will be a busy September, with Congress also facing Sept. 30 deadlines to agree on a new farm bill and reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. And the tensions over funding the government could chill the climate for negotiations. \u201cThey\u2019re reneging on what they negotiated,\u201d Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said of House Republicans. \u201cWhy negotiate with people if they\u2019re not going to stand by what they\u2019ve negotiated?\u201d",

        "content": "The couple who called in  Michael Charles Burham, 34, was taken into custody by 5:50 p.m. Saturday in Warren County after a weeklong manhunt, Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police said. Cindy and Ron Ecklund led authorities to Burham after their dog's barking alerted them to his presence.  Ron Ecklund said he got into a golf cart and drove down to the creek near their property to investigate.  \"Gentleman stands up and I asked him, 'So, what are you doing?'\" Ecklund told NBC News correspondent George Solis. \"He said, 'I'm camping.'\" Ecklund told his wife, who was outside the golf cart, to get back in the cart so they could return to the house.  \"We weren't halfway up the yard and I'm like: 'Dial 911. I know exactly who that is,'\" he said. \"I've seen his picture enough. He's been all over the news.\"  The couple believe they might be eligible for the reward authorities offered for information about Burham's whereabouts, which had increased to $22,000 by Friday.  Burham escaped from the Warren County Jail on July 7 by climbing through the metal grates of the jail yard\u2019s roof. He then climbed down using tied-together bedsheets, authorities said. Authorities described him as someone with \"survivalist skills\" who was comfortable in woods for long periods of time. At least 15 federal and local departments had been searching the area for him for eight days.  He was taken into custody at gunpoint and will be arraigned on an escape charge, Bivens said. Burham was being held in the county on kidnapping and other related charges. He is accused of having kidnapped a Warren County couple while on the run from authorities in New York, where he is a suspect in the May 11 murder of Kala Hodgkin. Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said last month that there were no state charges against Burham in the murder case. He was charged with flight to avoid prosecution in U.S. District Court for Western New York in May. The case was dismissed without prejudice on June 16, according to court records. A federal criminal complaint says Hodgkin was found fatally shot at her home. At the time of the killing, there was an active arrest warrant charging Burham with raping her, according to the complaint. While police were on their way to Hodgkin\u2019s home, a separate call came in that Burham had allegedly tried to break into an ex-girlfriend\u2019s home and then set her car on fire, the complaint says. Burham went on the run, leading authorities on a multistate manhunt before he was captured May 24 in South Carolina, the Jamestown Police Department in New York said. The complaint said Burham kidnapped a couple at gunpoint at their Sheffield, Pennsylvania, home while on the run. They were found alive in a cemetery in North Charleston, South Carolina. A note in their vehicle allegedly written by Burham told his father he was \u201csafe for now\u201d and apologized \u201cfor all the problems I caused the family,\u201d the complaint says.\u00a0",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 No Labels is facing increasing scrutiny over the possibility it could play a spoiler role in the 2024 presidential election, and its founder and CEO said in an exclusive interview that she vows to end the group\u2019s third-party 2024 effort if it risks putting Donald Trump back in the White House. But Nancy Jacobson repeatedly declined to offer any metric on how the group would determine whether to stand down. \u201cAs a Democrat? Categorically, that will not happen,\u201d Jacobson said in response to a question about concerns that a third-party ticket, running on the ballot line No Labels is seeking in every state, could siphon off votes from President Joe Biden and benefit Trump. \u201cThis effort will nev \u2014 we\u2019ll pull it down.\u201d Jacobson immediately added: \u201cWe will not spoil for either side. The only reason to do this is to win.\u201d It\u2019s a bold statement in a nation where the most successful third-party presidential effort in the last century finished a distant third. And even as the No Labels effort stepped out this week with a public campaign-style event in Manchester, New Hampshire, much of its political effort remains secret. The group doesn\u2019t reveal its donors and isn\u2019t publicly discussing its deliberations over whom it may recruit to run on its planned bipartisan ticket. The details of how it\u2019ll operate its convention in Dallas in April also aren\u2019t clear, though the group has no plans to hold traditional primaries or caucuses in which voters select a presidential nominee. Jacobson said the group will assess its standing after Super Tuesday and the Florida primary next year. Jacobson worked as a major fundraiser for the Clintons and the Democratic Party before she formed No Labels in 2010, helped create the congressional Problem Solvers Caucus and aided moderate members of Congress from both parties in their elections. Jacobson, a Democrat, demurred when she was asked whether Biden represented the bipartisan leader No Labels has hinged its efforts on. Biden ran his 2020 presidential campaign on the promise to work with congressional Republicans. His campaign has often pointed to the passage of the CHIPS Act, the infrastructure package and the debt ceiling deal \u2014 deals celebrated by No Labels\u2019 allies in Congress \u2014 as evidence of the president\u2019s work. \u201cJoe Biden is a good man. There has been a lot of tremendous legislation, but the point is it\u2019s about the voters. It\u2019s not about us,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the voters, and the voters of this country right now are not saying they want him as a choice \u2014 right now.\u201d Aspects of current polling are grim for Biden. Though he retained a slight lead against Trump in the most recent NBC News national poll, his approval rating stood at 43%. And 44% of voters, including a larger share of Democrats than Republicans, say they\u2019re open to considering a third-party candidate. It\u2019s against that backdrop that national Democrats have expressed deep concern about the consequences of No Labels\u2019 presidential efforts. \u201cI don\u2019t think No Labels is a political party,\u201d Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz.,  Jacobson said the group wouldn\u2019t disclose its donors, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing nefarious going on here.\u201d She said the group isn\u2019t legally obligated to reveal its financial sources. The Arizona Democratic Party  Even though it registered as a political party, Jacobson denied the group \u2014 which is incorporated as a so-called social welfare nonprofit organization \u2014 is acting in the capacity of a party, arguing that it will only make its ballot line available for a presidential ticket, not actually operate the eventual campaign.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s just language,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cThat\u2019s not \u2014 you know, we are not functioning \u2014 we are one ticket, one time. \u201cA party \u2014 [the] definition of a party is running candidates up and down the ballot. That is not what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she continued. Some Biden allies, seeing No Labels as a clear potential spoiler, have questioned the true motivations behind Jacobson\u2019s mission. But one of her longtime senior advisers, William Galston, who left the organization in April over his opposition to the presidential ticket operation, defended her intentions in an interview. \u201cI do not question the motives or the patriotism or the integrity of anybody involved in this effort,\u201d Galston said. \u201cMy opposition is a simple matter of political analysis. I believe there is a gap between what No Labels wants to do and what its efforts will, in fact, achieve.\u201d Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, helped Jacobson start No Labels in 2010 but left the organization in April over his opposition to the presidential ticket operation.\u00a0 \u201cI cannot see a serious possibility that an independent, bipartisan, centrist, third-party ticket can succeed and win the presidency,\u201d said Galston, adding: \u201cI fear that despite its intentions to the contrary, if it proceeds, it will end up \u2014 it will end up helping Donald Trump.\u201d According to the NBC News exit poll, most of those who voted third-party in 2016 decided to back Biden four years later, helping deny Trump re-election. Now, Democrats worry that a growing third-party vote in 2024 would lower the threshold Trump needs to win again \u2014 as it did in 2016, when 47% to 48% of the vote was enough for him to capture key swing states. Jacobson defended the organization\u2019s credibility in her interview, citing the numerous nationally recognized figures affiliated with it. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve been around for 13 years. They can see the leaders around this,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cThey can see Sen. Joe Lieberman. They can see Gov. Larry Hogan. They can see a civil rights leader, Ben Chavis. They can see all the leaders. They can see our work for the last 13 years.\u201d Monday in New Hampshire, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Jon Huntsman, the Republican former governor of Utah and ambassador to China, headlined No Labels\u2019 \u201cCommon Sense Town Hall\u201d at Saint Anselm College. Manchin  \u201cLet\u2019s see where everybody goes. Let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d Manchin said.\u00a0 Last week, businessman Mark Cuban  \u201cI like that they are trying a new path. I think the two-party system is broken,\u201d Cuban said.",

A panel of judges with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Monday but did not indicate when they will rule. \u201cWe\u2019re able to see from what happened last year; we have a very strong chance of substantial harm,\u201d Barber attorney Mara Klebaner told the panel. Richard Anderson, an assistant Alabama attorney general, told the court that the state will use a new IV team. He argued that shows a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to correct any problems that had occurred. He said the state submitted documentation showing the people responsible for setting IV lines are appropriately licensed. Klebaner argued the state\u2019s decision to pick a different IV team does not solve the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s like picking up a different can of soda off the shelf from a factory that isn\u2019t passing safety inspections,\u201d she said. After the internal review, Alabama also did away with its customary midnight deadline to get an execution underway in order to give the state more time to establish an intravenous line and battle last-minute legal appeals. The state will have until 6 a.m. Friday morning to get Barber\u2019s execution started. Barber was convicted of the 2001 beating death of 75-year-old Dorothy Epps. Prosecutors said Barber, a handyman who knew Epps\u2019 daughter, confessed to killing Epps with a claw hammer and fleeing with her purse. Jurors voted 11-1 to recommend a death sentence, which a judge imposed.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Center-right Republicans in the House are sounding the alarm that a series of aggressive demands by far-right lawmakers might gum up government funding legislation ahead of a crucial deadline to  The GOP members are pushing back against a band of 21 ultraconservatives who  Rep. David Joyce, R-Ohio, an Appropriations Committee member and the chair of the center-right Republican Governance Group, said that if hard-right members aren\u2019t realistic, the GOP majority will have to deal with House Democrats instead in the lead-up to the Sept. 30 funding deadline. \u201cI understand and appreciate their tactics. That makes for good sound bites or potential for their media saying they\u2019re the only ones who want to stand up and stop the spending. We\u2019re all conservative, but there\u2019s a majority of us who want to see this country work,\u201d Joyce said in an interview. \u201cWe can work together as Republicans, or we can work together with the Democrats.\u201d Joyce added that overly aggressive tactics could lead the GOP-controlled House to fail to pass its opening bid and instead empower Democrats. \u201cOur failure to act does strengthen the hand of the Senate and the office of the president,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to shut down the country over this? Shut down all spending? No, we\u2019re going to come to an agreement.\u201d Joyce also pushed back against  \u201cI\u2019ll say this to Jim to his face: Those are just requests,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get prioritized just because you\u2019re Jim Jordan.\u201d Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma, a co-chair of the Republican Main Street Caucus, said some of the 21 signers of the letter to McCarthy are shifting their demands after they initially insisted that bills move organically through committee. \u201cThose folks that have signed that letter are now moving the goalposts a little bit,\u201d Bice said in a brief interview. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s frustrating for a lot of us.\u201d In their letter to McCarthy, ultraconservatives also insisted that \u201crescissions\u201d of unspent money can\u2019t count toward their insistence that funding revert to fiscal 2022 levels. It\u2019s a familiar struggle for centrist Republicans, who are often agitated by the tactics of their far-right colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus yet struggle to stop them. Last week, a similar group stiff-armed McCarthy into adding divisive amendments to the annual defense policy bill, including abortion and transgender provisions, making the typically bipartisan measure partisan and setting up a fight with Democrats. Implied in the new pushback from GOP centrists is the threat to vote down funding bills that cater too much to the far right. But the right flank doesn\u2019t take such threats seriously, believing instead that its center-right colleagues will ultimately cave to its wishes. \u201cIf you\u2019re a moderate, you pull the gun out and you never expect to have to fire it. Whereas if you\u2019re a conservative and you pull a gun out, you\u2019re ready to pull the trigger,\u201d said a House Republican staffer, who requested anonymity to describe the internal dynamic. Along the way, some Republicans fear, loading up government funding legislation with unpopular provisions \u2014 like steeply cutting rural energy programs, defunding federal law enforcement or adding anti-abortion measures \u2014 could cost politically vulnerable Republicans re-election in 2024, with Democrats salivating at the idea of weaponizing their votes. Some Republicans say the House will end up reverting to funding levels in the debt limit law, even though McCarthy has greenlighted the far-right demands to pass an initial bill with less spending before negotiations with the Democratic-led Senate and President Joe Biden. \u201cWhat happens is we go a little to the right on these votes, and by the time we negotiate with the Senate and the president, we\u2019re back with the debt ceiling agreement,\u201d said Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents an Omaha-based district that Biden won in 2020. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking back to the debt ceiling agreement, I believe, by the time we\u2019re done. \u201cAnd then they\u2019ll be all mad,\u201d Bacon added. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., the other co-chair of the Main Street Caucus, said the intra-party disagreement is primarily over tactics. \u201cIt may be that when the rubber hits the road, there\u2019s increased tension. But a lot of Republicans want to spend less money,\u201d Johnson said, adding that some in the conference don\u2019t have to vote for the bipartisan final funding deal. \u201cCoalitions on final passage don\u2019t have to look the same as coalitions for initial passage.\u201d Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., one of the 21 signers of last week's letter, said conservatives aren\u2019t worried about the more moderate GOP lawmakers\u2019 voting down a bill that leans too far to the right. \u201cIf they do, then it is what it is,\u201d Norman said with a shrug. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing what\u2019s good for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not happy with the debt ceiling deal. \u2026 The only leverage we have now is the appropriations.\u201d A sticking point for the right is that it views certain provisions in appropriations bills as accounting gimmicks, which could prove problematic to meeting the targets in a way 218 Republicans can rally around. \u201cI\u2019m very pro-rescissions. I\u2019m just not pro-rescissions\u2019 being used to backfill or elevate the overall spending for the agency,\u201d said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas. \u201cThat is what is happening now. ... So that\u2019s where the debate lies on the appropriations.\u201d Asked about the prospects of a shutdown on Oct. 1 if Congress fails to reach a deal, Roy said that was up to Biden. \u201cThat depends on whether the administration wants to work with us to change policies that need to be changed,\u201d he said, adding that the House Republicans must use the \u201cpower of the purse\u201d to fight for their values. \u201cYou got to force the hand of the administration. We\u2019re moving the needle.\u201d",

        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For the first time since the 1980s, a U.S. nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) visited South Korea on Tuesday, as the allies began talks to coordinate their responses in the event of a nuclear war with North Korea. White House Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell confirmed the rare visit, which had been expected after it was announced in a joint declaration during a summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and President Joe Biden in Washington in April. \u201cAs we speak, an American nuclear submarine is making port in Busan today. That\u2019s the first visit of (an) American nuclear submarine in decades,\u201d Campbell told reporters at a briefing in Seoul, where he was attending the first Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) discussion with South Korean officials. The group, aimed at better coordinating an allied nuclear response in the event of a war with North Korea, was also announced during the April summit amid growing calls in South Korea for its own nuclear weapons, a step Washington opposes. North Korea, which test fired an intercontinental ballistic missile last week, condemned the NCG on Monday for \u201copenly discussing the use of nukes\u201d and warned against allied plans to increase displays of military force, including the submarine visit. Campbell did not identify the submarine, but said its visit is a manifestation of American commitment to South Korea\u2019s defense. South Korea\u2019s defense ministry later confirmed the submarine\u2019s arrival and identified it as the USS Kentucky, an Ohio-class SSBN. U.S. SSBNs rely on stealth to ensure their survival and preserve their ability to launch nuclear missiles during a war, and they rarely make public stops in foreign ports. The United States has pledged to deploy more strategic assets such as aircraft carriers, submarines and long-range bombers to South Korea to deter North Korea, which has developed increasingly powerful missiles that can hit targets as far away as the United States. The U.S. Navy fields 14 SSBNs, often referred to as \u201cboomers.\u201d The Ohio-class submarines carry 20 Trident II D5 missiles, each of which can deliver up to eight nuclear warheads to targets as far as 7,500 miles away. There were regular SSBN visits to South Korea in the 1970s, another period when South Korea was debating the strength of the U.S. commitment and the need for its own nuclear arsenal, according to a report by the Federation of American Scientists. South Korea\u2019s Principal Deputy National Security Adviser Kim Tae-hyo, who co-chaired the meeting, said the discussions are enough to ensure there is no need for South Korea to develop its own nuclear weapons. The two sides agreed to facilitate information sharing \u2014 including establishing a secure communication network \u2014 and coordination and planning in the event of a North Korean nuclear attack, which would face an \u201coverwhelming\u201d allied response, Kim said. The allies will also develop \u201coperations, exercises, simulations, trainings, and investment activities\u201d to bolster nuclear deterrence and response capabilities on the Korean Peninsula, according to a statement released after the meeting. Yoon, the South Korean president, said the NCG would be a \u201cstarting point\u201d to build a strong and effective deterrence against North Korea. \u201cThrough a South Korea-U.S. alliance upgraded to a new nuclear-based paradigm, we will make substantial efforts to fundamentally block North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threats,\u201d he told a briefing. China and North Korea have criticized the group\u2019s formation as further raising tensions on the Korean Peninsula.",

        "title": "Lebanon clashes: Nine killed at Palestinian refugee camp",
        "content": "Fighting at a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon which left at least nine people dead has continued on Monday. The clashes at the Ein el-Hilweh camp broke out between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah movement and rival Islamist groups. Among the dead was a Fatah commander, the movement confirmed. Established in 1948, the restive Ein el-Hilweh camp is the largest in Lebanon with more than 63,000 registered refugees, the UN says. Some estimates say the population is higher. The camp, situated near the southern city of Sidon, falls outside the jurisdiction of the Lebanese security forces. It is left up to rival factions within the camp to maintain its security, but factional disputes are common. The weekend's violence erupted on Saturday when a member of an Islamist group was killed, AFP news agency reports quoting an unnamed source inside the camp. Tensions continued to mount through to Sunday, culminating with the death of the Fatah commander, Ashraf al-Armouchi, and several of his aides. A ceasefire was agreed late on Sunday, but skirmishes continued through the night. Automatic weapons and anti-tank fire were heard on Monday morning, according to the AFP news agency. Dozens of residents have fled their homes within the camp. Ceasefire negotiations are ongoing, and the local MP is expected to hold a meeting later on Monday to try to resolve the tensions. In a statement quoted by AFP, Fatah denounced an \"abominable and cowardly crime\" aimed at undermining the \"security and stability\" of the Palestinian camps in Lebanon. The Palestinian presidency denounced the fighting, calling the security of the camps a \"red line\". \"It is not permissible for anyone to intimidate our people and tamper with their security,\" it said in a statement. As well as the nine dead, Lebanese soldiers were also injured during the violence, the Lebanese army said. The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon (UNRWA), Dorothee Kraus, said all the agency's operations in the camp had been suspended. She called on \"all militant parties to ensure civilians' safety and respect inviolability of UN premises\". More than 479,000 refugees are registered with UNRWA in Lebanon, the agency says. About half live in the country's 12 refugee camps, which have \"dire\" living conditions, it adds. You may also be interested in:",

        "title": "Sudan conflict: Women tell BBC horror stories of rape",
        "content": "While Kolthom was being gang-raped by four paramilitary fighters in Sudan's war-hit Darfur region, she was also being racially abused. Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing. \"They were very barbaric. They took turns raping me under the tree where I had gone to gather wood to [make a fire to] keep warm,\" she said in a quivering voice, down the phone line. We have changed her name and that of another rape survivor quoted in this article. Kolthoum, who is in her 40s, is from West Darfur's black African Masalit community, while her rapists were Arabs from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This paramilitary group is accused of carrying out many atrocities in a conflict that has increasingly assumed racial and ethnic overtones in Darfur. Kolthoum lived in El Geneina - historically a symbol of black African power in Darfur, and the traditional capital of the Masalit kingdom. She has now fled with her ill husband and children. Kolthoum says her rapists told her to leave the city as it \"belongs to the Arabs\", fuelling the fears of many black Africans that the RSF - along with allied militias known as the Janjaweed - want to turn the ethnically mixed region into an Arab-ruled domain. Sudan plunged into a civil war in mid-April, after its two most powerful generals - army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as \"Hemedti\" - fell out. Their feud has reignited the conflict in Darfur, which first broke out in 2003, causing the deaths of an estimated 300,000 people in the region. The latest conflict has forced more than 160,000 people, mostly from the Massalit community to flee to Chad. It is unclear how many people have been killed in the region, with the lowest estimate of the death toll in El Geneina put at 5,000. RSF fighters have also been accused of carrying out atrocities in Sudan's most populous state - Khartoum, home to the capital city. The paramilitaries control much of the state, with the army failing to push them back. The fighting has led to an exodus of close to two million people since mid-April. In Khartoum, the violence has not taken a racial or ethnic dimension. Arabs and people of other ethnicities are victims of the ongoing battles. Ibtissam, 24, told the BBC she was on her way to visit her aunt when three RSF soldiers stopped her. \"They pulled their guns at me and asked me where I was going. When I told them that I was going to my aunt's house, they accused me of belonging to the army's intelligence services,\" she told me, her voice breaking. The soldiers then forced her to accompany them in their car and took her into a nearby house. \"I saw another man inside the house, stripped to his underwear. I tried to run away. But one of the soldiers hit me so hard, I fell to the floor. They threatened to kill me if I moved or yelled again,\" she said, as she wept over the phone. \"The three of them took turns raping me more than once. They then led me back into their car and threw me on the side of the road at sunset,\" she said. After a short pause, Ibtissam described how she felt \"utterly humiliated and angry\". \"I wanted to commit suicide. But I held it together. I went back home and did not tell anyone what happened.\" The UN Human Rights office in Sudan said in early July that it had received reports of 21 incidents of sexual violence against at least 57 women and girls. UN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk noted that \"the RSF has been identified as the perpetrator\" in almost all cases reported to his office. Both the UN and local rights groups believe these numbers are only a fraction of the real scale of the crime. Sudanese human rights activist Ahlam Nasser said she had no doubt that rape was being used \"systematically\" as a weapon of war to terrorise people. \"[Rape] has been used in Darfur in the past and it is being used in this current war in Khartoum, particularly by the RSF,\" she said. The activist has now fled the country. She said she too had heard horror stories from some of the women back in Khartoum. \"In some cases, mothers were raped in front of their children,\" Ms Nasser said. The RSF has denied its fighters are behind these attacks. In a voice recording sent to the BBC, its spokesman Mohammed al-Mukhtar said their fighters \"commit to the highest ethical standards of warfare\". \"There are deliberate campaigns to tarnish the reputation of our fighters after the military victories we've achieved,\" he added. When I told him that I had spoken to women who had identified RSF fighters as their attackers, Mr al-Mukhtar said that people masquerading as RSF members were responsible for the atrocities. The conflict has left survivors of rape and sexual violence with little help. Most hospitals are no longer functioning, and it can be difficult to reach the few that are. Kolthoum and Ibtissam told me the pain will haunt them forever. \"I will never forget what happened to me. A mark of shame will follow me forever, just like my shadow,\" Kolthoum said.",

        "title": "WeChat: Why does Elon Musk want X to emulate China's everything-app?",
        "content": "Earlier this week Elon Musk rebranded Twitter to X - another step in his plan to emulate Chinese mega app WeChat. Mr Musk has long said that he wants to transform his social media firm, which he bought last year for $44bn (\u00a334.4bn), into a much larger platform. He has previously praised WeChat - a so-called \"everything app\" that combines chat, dating, payments and social media - and has said creating something \"even close to that with Twitter... would be an immense success\". In a post on X this week, Mr Musk said that over the coming months, \"we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world\". He will hope that growing X will lead to a jump in revenue - the company has lost almost half its advertising revenue since Mr Musk bought it, and it is struggling under a heavy debt load. Launched by technology giant Tencent in 2011, WeChat is now used by almost all of China's 1.4bn people. Calling it a super-app is an understatement. Its services include messaging, voice and video calling, social media, food delivery, mobile payments, games, news and even dating. It is like WhatsApp, Facebook, Apple Pay, Uber, Amazon, Tinder and a whole lot more rolled into one. It is so woven into the fabric of Chinese society that it is almost impossible to live there without it. As you can see from the images below, the interfaces for its various parts are distinct. It started as a messaging platform like WhatsApp or iMessage, and its two most-used features are the WhatsApp-like \"Chats\" and \"Moments\", which is similar to Facebook. Its widely-used \"Wallet\" feature can be linked to debit and credit cards - most shops and online retailers in China accept WeChat payments, with users scanning QR codes to pay. People can also pay household bills, make investments, and even take out loans on WeChat. Government services are also on WeChat, with users able to check social security information, pay speeding tickets and book hospital appointments. And during the pandemic, it became an essential: while the whole country was under strict zero-Covid restrictions, it was impossible to move around without a \"health code\" generated on the app. But there are several downsides to having so many features on one app. From a practical point of view, WeChat takes up a large part of a phone's memory - typically tens of gigabytes of data storage. More seriously, the huge reach of WeChat into every corner of Chinese life has raised concerns about government censorship, surveillance and other privacy issues. China blocks access to many foreign websites, from news outlets like the BBC to social media platforms such as Facebook and, ironically, Elon Musk's X. This level of state control over the internet also makes it extremely dangerous for people to speak out against the government on WeChat. It is not unusual for dissenting voices to have their accounts suspended for days or weeks for something they have said in Chats or on Moments. Even people sharing seemingly uncontroversial information have found themselves on the wrong side of government censors and had their accounts and chat groups shut down. Kitsch Liao, assistant director of the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, says super-apps like WeChat align with Beijing's aims of organising all aspects of life to keep control of the country. \"Principally to prevent 'political risk' - anything that could germinate into an opposition and eventual risk to the CCP's [Chinese Communist Party's] rule.\" WeChat's huge success in China is down to two major factors, Kecheng Fang, at Chinese University of Hong Kong, tells the BBC. For one, most people in China access WeChat on smartphones, rather than desktop computers, due to the relatively late development of the internet in the country. \"Which means they live in the walled gardens of apps rather than the open web. It is much easier to build an 'everything app' on smartphones than on computers,\" he says. Mr Fang also says that China's lack of competition regulation - which contrasts with most Western countries - allows an app like WeChat to effectively block rival platforms, such as shopping platform Taobao and video app Douyin. Could Mr Musk make a similar app work outside China? We may be finding out soon - and experts believe it may all depend on digital payments. Kendra Schaefer, from policy research firm Trivium China, says that Mr Musk has already recognised some of the key elements that have helped make WeChat \"critical to daily life\" in China, including integrating social media with digital payments. That could be the \"secret sauce of the super-app\", she says. Edith Yeung, from investment firm Race Capital, points out that a major difference between China and the West is the widespread adoption of digital payment technology. While shops in China are legally obliged to accept cash, in practice, digital payments are far more common. This difference, she says, may be an obstacle to Mr Musk's ambitions. \"It will take the Western world longer to implement a truly cashless or credit card free society,\" she says.",

        "title": "China using families as 'hostages' to quash Uyghur dissent abroad",
        "content": "China is pressuring Uyghurs living abroad to spy on human rights campaigners by threatening families back home, researchers say. Refugees and activists tell the BBC intimidating tactics are tearing communities apart. \"My dearest son,\" said Alim's mother as she flickered into view. \"I didn't think I'd see you before I died.\" Alim - not his real name - says he was overcome by the moment. The reunion over a video call was their first contact in six years, since he fled as a refugee to the UK. But it was bittersweet: someone else was in control of the call. Like all Uyghurs - a mostly Muslim minority from north-western China - Alim's mother lives under intense surveillance and control. They could never call each other directly. Instead, a middleman phoned Alim and his mother from two separate mobiles. He held the phone screens to face each other, so the pair could see wobbly images of each other - and hear muffled sound from the speakers. Alim says they barely spoke, and spent most of the call in tears. He doesn't know if the plain white wall he could see behind his mother was in her house in Xinjiang or an internment camp, where the Chinese government is alleged to have detained more than a million Uyghurs. China has long denied those charges. But Alim says he knew this contact with his mother would come at a cost - because the man brokering the call was a Chinese police officer. When the officer called again, he asked Alim to attend meetings of Uyghur human rights activists, gather intelligence and pass it back to the Chinese state. \"Whenever there was an anti-China protest in London, they would call me and ask who would be attending,\" says Alim, who shared with the BBC recordings of the phone calls requesting he work as a spy. Alim was offered money, too, so he could try to befriend the leaders of campaign groups - many of them UK citizens - by taking them to restaurants and picking up the bill. The officer suggested setting up a company as a front, in case suspicions were raised about his newfound wealth. Plenty of businesses had already been set up on behalf of others for that exact purpose, Alim was told. The implied threat, that his family may come to harm if he refused, has left him in a vicious bind. \"They are using my family as hostages,\" Alim says. \"I am living in a dark moment.\" Watch more on BBC Newsnight on BBC Two at 22:30 on Monday 31 July, or catch up afterwards on BBC iPlayer The tactics employed by governments to police their diasporas abroad are known as transnational repression. Research suggests this particular kind - controlling access to family members in the home country through video calls, in exchange for compliance overseas - is commonly used by Chinese police. Dr David Tobin at the University of Sheffield has conducted some of the most comprehensive research on the topic to date, with his colleague Nyrola Elim\u00e4. They have interviewed and surveyed more than 200 members of the Uyghur diaspora in several countries. He says all Uyghurs living outside China are victims of transnational repression. \"Family separation is the central tactic,\" he says. Even where phone calls are technically possible, relatives still living in China won't pick up, according to Dr Tobin. He says there is an assumption that calls will be monitored, and a fear that communicating freely will put them at risk. This severing of family ties allows Chinese police to step in and offer tightly managed access - over video calls - as an incentive to comply, with the threat of repercussions for the family if they do not. In the UK, Dr Tobin surveyed or interviewed 48 Uyghurs, from a population of about 400 people. Of those, two-thirds reported having been contacted directly by Chinese police - and pressured to spy, refrain from advocacy work, or stop speaking to the media. And Uyghurs in the UK are far from the worst affected. In Turkey, traditionally a safe haven for Uyghurs where 50,000 live in one of the largest communities outside China, 80% of the 148 of respondents reported similar threats from Chinese authorities. Abdurehim Para\u00e7 arrived in Istanbul in 2014, having fled China a year earlier. \"Turkey was completely different to anything we'd experienced. We could travel wherever we wanted. The police didn't bother us,\" he says. \"I couldn't believe such a life was possible.\" But in the past few years, the picture has changed for Uyghurs in Turkey. Reports that police based in China have pressured people to spy on each other have filtered through the community, splintering their sense of camaraderie. In a video posted on Facebook, a young Uyghur man who appears to have been captured and beaten by his peers, offers a troubled confession - admitting to spying on behalf of Beijing. While the circumstances surrounding the scene are unclear, the footage has been circulated among the Uyghur community, and the man has been widely condemned online. The accumulation of stories like these is having an effect, Abdurehim says. \"Young people are distancing themselves from Uyghur protests and meetings. They are worried that people there might be spies,\" he says. \"China's plan is working.\" Dr Tobin thinks Turkish authorities are aware of what's happening and have been slow to respond. \"The more dependent a country is on investment from China, the more likely it is to cooperate or to turn a blind eye,\" he says. Turkey is seen as having grown closer to China in recent years, and questions have been raised about its commitment to protecting its Uyghur community. The Turkish government did not respond to a request for comment. But China is not only targeting people in countries where it has economic supremacy. Julie Millsap, a US-born activist who works with the Uyghur Human Rights Project in Washington DC, says China has tried to pressure her through her in-laws. Her husband is Han Chinese, part of the country's largest ethnic group, and the two met in China before moving to the US capital in 2020. After Julie began campaigning on behalf of Uyghurs, local police began dropping in on her extended family in China, saying they \"wanted to be friends\". She and her husband received threatening messages from her sister-in-law's phone, suggesting Julie's children may end up \"as orphans\". \"They weren't written in a language style that she used,\" says Julie, who suspects the police were instructing her to send them. During a recent video call between her husband, in Washington DC, and his sister, in China, the police happened to stop by, allowing Julie to record the moment, and confront one of the officers directly. \"He stammered and asked us not to misinterpret his intentions,\" she says. The officer told her police were arranging visits to all local families with US relatives, in light of the \"delicate\" relationship between the US and China. Julie recognises that a white American and a Han Chinese family are afforded a degree of safety that Uyghurs are not. \"But we're still talking about police harassment, about threats, about a daily reality that is anything but good,\" she says. She thinks it is alarming that Chinese authorities feel comfortable targeting foreign citizens and attempting to dictate their work. The US government is beginning to address the problem formally. In March, senators introduced the Transnational Repression Policy Act, listing a range of abuses including \"coercion by proxy\", which covers threats to family members overseas. If passed, the law would see the creation of a dedicated phone line to report threats, and prompt Congress to bring sanctions against perpetrators wherever possible. Abduweli Ayup, a Uyghur rights campaigner based in Norway, thinks the US legislation would be a step in the right direction, but that Western governments should go further. Each time a case is reported to the authorities, questions should be lodged directly with the Chinese government, requesting assurance that family members are safe, he says. \"We are your citizens, your neighbours and your taxpayers. Our governments should take some responsibility,\" says Mr Ayup. Dr Tobin recognises the complications inherent in tackling the issue. \"Saying 'would you like to speak to your family?' isn't a crime. We know it's a threat. We know it breaks communities, and causes mental health problems and trauma, but it is not a crime on British soil,\" he says. The UK Home Office says attempts to intimidate overseas critics are \"unacceptable\", that an internal review into transnational repression is underway, and all such incidents should be reported to law enforcement. In a statement, the Chinese Embassy in London called the allegations of transnational repression \"totally groundless\". The Chinese government \"protects Uyghurs and their communication with overseas relatives in accordance with the law\", it said. Alim chose not to report his case to the police, but confessed his predicament to a group of Uyghur rights activists in London. One of the group's leaders told us the requests were very common, and posed challenges to the integrity of the community - but insisted their advocacy work would continue. In their experience, almost all advances from Chinese police are rejected. Alim wrestled with the issue before reaching a decision. \"I realised that betraying others for the sake of my family would mean selling out my nation, and I couldn't do that. \"If that was the price I had to pay, so be it.\" He too refused China's offer.",

        "title": "Felix Klieser: The problem-solving French horn player of the BBC Proms",
        "content": "Look at the BBC Proms poster this year and you'll spot some classical big-hitters - the conductor Sir Simon Rattle and cello superstar Sheku Kanneh Mason. But look closer still and you'll clock a suave French horn player\u2026and his toes. Felix Klieser has been described as a virtuoso and has performed all over the world, but born without arms he plays the instrument with his left foot. \"It was a little miracle,\" Felix says, that he became a French horn player at all. Not because of his limb difference but because when he asked to learn the instrument, aged four, his family had no idea what he was talking about. \"I'd never been to a concert, I'd never met a horn player and in my family there was no one making music. My parents said: 'Err, what is a French horn?\" he told the BBC's Access All podcast. His family did some research and lucked out. In the German city of G\u00f6ttingen, where Felix grew up \"there was one music school and at the music school there was one horn teacher\". Felix enrolled and a life-time of problem solving began. Questions rapidly stacked up. How would he play an instrument that requires one hand to support the horn and the other to create the sound? Without fingers, how would he use the valves to change the note? At first it wasn't a problem at all. As a child Felix could sit on the floor and reach the mouthpiece with someone holding the horn. As he grew, he worked with a \"creative person who can build strange things\" to develop a stand which holds the instrument in place. As for the lack of fingers, Felix realised he could kick his left leg up and angle his foot to use his dexterous toes just as well. The position is an impressive sight, even to Felix. \"When I see myself it looks very interesting and very spectacular. But when I play by myself it's a very comfortable position,\" he says. \"It's something I can do for hours.\" The biggest challenge was not an obvious physical one, it was making the French horn actually sound like a French horn. It consists of a 12ft brass tube, which curls round into an open \"bell\" where the sound comes out. Horn players put their right hand in the bell to create the familiar, haunting, sound you might have heard in popular film music like Jurassic Park. Without a hand to put in the bell, Felix realised he would have to create the tone entirely through the way he played. \"There was no teacher who could teach you how to play the horn in this way. It was more trial and error. I've just my lips, I've just my air,\" he says. \"You have to control the air in a different way and take care of the position of your lips, of your tongue. This was maybe the most challenging thing, I practised a lot.\" This technique sets Felix apart from other players. He was recognised very early on in his studies as exceptional by any standard, but even those closest to him doubted he would be accepted into the classical music world. LISTEN: You can hear more from Felix on the BBC Access All podcast. As a teenager, Felix studied at Hanover University of Music, Drama and Media and won a prestigious prize. At the time, he and his teacher were interviewed for a newspaper. The reporter asked Felix if he planned on a professional career. \"My answer was something like: 'Maybe it could be possible, I don't know because I'm still at school''.\" Then his teacher, a famous player, interrupted him. \"It's a good hobby for you, but you will never be a professional horn player. Never, never, never. You don't have the right hand, and the bell works differently. It will never work'.\" It was a sliding doors moment for Felix, who abruptly and unexpectedly learned life offers you two options. \"You have to decide, should I try to show that it is possible or should I give up? These situations happen quite often in my life,\" he says. Rather than strive to become a professional musician, Felix simply wanted to \"play the French horn as good as possible,\" and see how far that would take him. It has taken him all over the world, to the south coast of England where he recently completed a two-year residency with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and even on tour with the singer, Sting. But he says the biggest lesson he learned goes back to his early years. \"The most important thing, when I grew up, is to learn to solve problems,\" he says. \"I never knew what is possible for me and what is not possible. But when you have a way of thinking, 'Ok, I can solve every problem,' then you have many, many possibilities in your life. \"And this is not a question of having a disability or not, because in the end all of us has something where he or she thinks 'Ok, there is a limit'.\" Felix faced a serious challenge recently. One that is relatable to all of us - getting through the Covid-19 pandemic. As a professional musician, he went from having a full concert schedule to nothing. \"I stopped practising because it was not necessary anymore,\" he says. \"Then I bought a PlayStation and did a lot of PlayStation,\" using the controller with his toes. One day it occurred to him: \"Maybe it's a little bit sad for my horn to be in the case and not to be useful anymore?\" He took it out and they became re-acquainted. After all these years together he gave it a name - Alex. He even bought some googly eyes to bring Alex to life. Then he cast his eyes around and wondered what non-musical activities Alex could get involved with if he wasn't being played - cooking was the first to come to mind and to entertain his online followers. Even now with a full concert schedule once again, Alex lives a very fulfilled and varied life for a horn. It has been a fun way to connect with fans all over the world but some will get to watch Felix play in London when he takes to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall for his BBC Proms debut on 2 and 3 August. He will perform Mozart's Horn Concerto No. 4. \"I'm excited,\" he says. \"For me the most important thing is to get to know the audience here. \"When you're young and start a career then you're looking to play with famous conductors, famous orchestras. But right now I want to play music for people to make the world a little bit more beautiful.\" You can listen to the podcast and find information and support on the Access All page.",

        "title": "Supreme Court: India's most powerful court is drowning under thousands of cases",
        "content": "Scholars have hailed India's Supreme Court as the most powerful in the world - and not without reason. The 73-year-old court can nullify executive acts, parliamentary laws and amendments to the Constitution. It also has the power to initiate cases independently, appoint \"friends of the court\" to help it in cases, and set up expert panels to aid in its decision-making process. Today, 34 judges handle an overwhelming load of nearly 70,000 appeals and petitions, issuing some 1,000 judgements every year. Yet, despite its great authority and power, the \"court is in crisis\", say Aparna Chandra, Sital Kalantry and William HJ Hubbard in an exhaustive data-driven account called Court on Trial. And the authors find that one of the main reasons is the huge backlog of cases that also leave litigants in limbo and drain them financially. The new work of the troika of law scholars presents several striking findings, drawing from five distinct and exclusive datasets derived from records of over a million Supreme Court cases. Here are some: Most significantly the Special Leave Petitions (SLPs), the preferred means for civil and criminal appeals to the court, constitute over 90% of the court's total docket. This, say the authors of the study, crowd out writ petitions and constitutional challenges. \"There is no clear benchmark for determining which types of cases deserve admission under the SLP route,\" they note. Then there are issues about what the authors say is the \"pick and choose model\" through which some cases jump the queues and get listed for early hearing. The researchers cite a case in July 2020 where the court dismissed a writ which argued that it gave priority to the bail application of a prominent journalist, while the petitioner's case was not being given adequate attention. The judges justified the swift listing of the journalist's case because it pertained to the \"liberty and freedom of media.\" This, the authors say, gave rise to comparisons with a petition filed against the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir questioning the lack of a court-directed mechanism to review decisions on internet restrictions in the region, a case concerning the \"liberty and freedom of media\" of millions of citizens. The heavy backlog has allowed the court to avoid difficult cases by simply not listing them at all, the authors say. This form of \"judicial evasion\" keeps \"important cases hanging, while it focuses on more mundane matters\". The authors provide compelling examples. For instance, the court took a full five years to decide on the challenge to the government's biometric ID scheme, Aadhaar, without issuing any suspension orders. During this period, more than a billion people enrolled for the scheme, effectively undermining the impact of the challenge. (In 2018, the court upheld the scheme, saying it was constitutional and did not violate the right to privacy.) Then there were the petitions questioning electoral bonds, which are interest-free financial instruments for making donations to political parties. The bonds were introduced in February 2018 to flush out illicit cash and make political financing more transparent. Critics say the bonds are \"unconstitutional and problematic\"- there is no public record of who bought each bond and to whom the donation was made. The authors highlight that the case languished for a year, finally being heard in April 2019, coinciding with the general elections. The court took up the petitions again this January, and in March was mulling whether it should be referred to a constitution bench. And this is a case which \"touches on the very nature of India's democratic polity and its possible subversion\", the authors say. The prioritisation of more mundane cases over pressing matters in the court system invites criticism that the \"court uses its backlog as a shield to evade politically sensitive issues\", says Nick Robinson, a fellow at the Harvard Law School. \"Yes it does [invite the criticism of judicial evasion],\" Madan Lokur, a former judge of the Supreme Court, told me. \"But I must admit that the court has taken up some contentious issues for hearing, but also has dumped others like the electoral bonds case.\" Mr Robinson believes the backlog in cases had \"long distanced the court\" from its core goals. \"Hearing so many ordinary cases isn't a requirement of the Constitution, but is a choice the court had actively decided to make\". The court, he says, is \"balancing different competing interests around access, correcting errors made by high courts, and setting out clear and authoritative precedent on major legal issues\". Clearly, delays in the court are happening because of increase in litigation, limited judicial resources and the court's acceptance of a broad number of appeals. The authors of the new study advocate for a reduced caseload. India's Supreme Court crowns a three-tier judicial system: district courts, high courts, and the apex court. The authors of the study say the lower courts should handle the majority of cases, reserving only those that introduce novel legal issues or allow the Supreme Court to establish new, explicit legal guidelines to assist lower courts in future decisions. But high courts are also a part of the problem, says Mr Lokur. He says some judgements of the high court are \"out of sync and the Supreme Court has no option but to interfere in them in appeal\".(By the way, six million cases are pending in India's 25 high courts.) Mr Robinson says the Supreme Court \"needs to decide what institutional goals it wants to prioritise\". \"Many have called on the Supreme Court to take fewer cases, but decide them with larger, more authoritative benches that set out clear precedent for the high courts to follow,\" says Mr Robinson. With a breathtaking pileup of more than 50 million cases clogging all of India's courts, the country's strained justice system remains an agonising crawl and a punishment for common people. The top court, clearly, needs to clean up its own backlog. \"The court must appreciate,\" says Mr Lokur, \"that it cannot correct every error\". BBC News India is now on YouTube.

        "title": "Why it's getting easier to be a single mum in China",
        "content": "Until last year it was not really possible for most unmarried women to become mothers in China - practically speaking. But a social change is under way and it is driving shifts in policy too. In her flat on the outskirts of Shanghai, Zhang Meili rocks her baby back and forth. As he gurgles away happily, she tells him that she's going to head out soon to earn money for him. After his mother goes to work, two-month-old Heng Heng will be looked after by his grandmother - who recently moved to China's largest city to help her daughter raise her child. That there is no father in Heng Heng's life would be frowned upon by many in China, especially in more conservative rural and regional areas. The belief that a child should not be brought into this world without a mother and a father is still widely held here. In Zhang Meili's case, she says she was lucky to have moved to Shanghai to run a business because being a single mother in this mega-city is much more accepted. \"I'm grateful for the tolerance of Shanghai,\" she says. \"I'm from rural Henan, an area which would have a lot of discrimination against me as a single mother.\" She became a single mum after her boyfriend's family rejected his choice of bride. They considered her position in society to be too modest. So he broke up with her - even though she was pregnant with his child. I ask her mother, Mrs Zhao, how she felt when she heard the news that her daughter, who is 25, would keep the baby. \"My feelings? I was heartbroken,\" she says. \"It's very hard to raise a kid on your own. And, in our hometown, there would be criticism from neighbours.\" Have her feelings changed now that she's a grandmother? \"Now I see him, I'm really happy,\" she says with a huge smile on her face. Zhang Meili has options that many unmarried women don't have because she runs her own small business. This gives her more independence and control over her life. Though the little massage shop she runs is still struggling post-Covid, she doesn't need to clear leave with an employer or battle for social acceptance in a workplace because she has given birth to a son who will be raised without his dad. Of course, it has not been easy for Zhang Meili to keep her business afloat during such a rocky time economically, with the added challenges of giving birth, plus knowing that - while attitudes are changing - there are still those who will look down on her. She says that none of her friends backed her decision to keep her child. They thought it would harm her chances of eventually finding a husband, and that it wasn't right for the child to grow up without a father. \"When I was pregnant, I went to the hospital alone,\" she says. \"At the time, my shop was struggling to survive and, when I looked around, I did envy the women who went there with their husbands. \"But I chose to become a single mum. I chose to have him, and I needed to get over this.\" Yet it was not only people's beliefs which made it very hard to become a single parent. Before 2016, the government effectively prohibited this from happening by stopping officials from issuing birth approval certificates, without seeing proof of marriage for the father and mother. Another problem had been the requirement for both parents' ID details to be listed in order for a child to get a hukou - the identity document which all Chinese citizens need to, for example, enrol in school. When I first came to China two decades ago, I recall unmarried women telling me that they would have no choice but to have an abortion if they became pregnant accidentally because a child could not survive in this country without all the required paperwork. Even after these rules changed, it remained virtually impossible for most unmarried women to consider having a child until last year because they could not get access to the health insurance needed to pay for the hospital, or to paid maternity leave. These two things have now supposedly changed but, in practice, an employer must apply on behalf of a staff member for the benefits to kick in - and some companies are still refusing to do it. A lawyer working on cases in this field told us she had a client whose boss at a large franchise would not facilitate her getting access to paid maternity leave. Only after she sued the company did they agree to do it. \"It really depends on the openness of the company and the awareness of employers regarding the rights of their staff,\" the lawyer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"However local policies are actually vague and sometimes companies are operating in a grey zone here.\" Some bosses don't understand that the regulations have changed, the lawyer added. Others are not keeping their knowledge up to date because they simply don't want to. They may consider single parenting to be wrong. Prof Yang Juhua from Beijing's Minzu University says that, under Chinese law, all mothers and their children should enjoy the same rights regardless of marital status. \"But, in terms of implementation, it is not smooth,\" she says. \"Why? Because many people still can't understand, and are not tolerant towards, single mothers.\" Prof Yang, an expert in demography, says the rules were set up without single mothers in mind. \"China's regulations are designed for married couples,\" she adds. \"Marriage is the pre-condition. Single parents are still a new thing here and represent a way of thinking which is very different to our traditional ethical norms\". One factor driving change for policymakers has been the country's ageing population. After decades of the one-child policy, the government would now like young couples to have more babies, but many are not answering the call, for financial reasons. They think they don't have sufficient funds to raise multiple children. Under these circumstances, if single women want to have children, those in positions of authority have decided they should be encouraged to. Visiting a cavernous exhibition centre in the south-eastern city of Hangzhou, we meet Peng Qingqing, among the toys, nappies and mountains of milk formula at a commercial fair focusing on baby products. Peng Qingqing, who runs an online sales platform, is herself heavily pregnant and unmarried, and, like Zhang Meili, she says that being a businesswoman has made this easier. \"My mum always told me that women should be more independent, confident, and strong,\" she tells us. \"I don't want to marry into another family just because of a child\". The 30-year-old says the time wasn't right for marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with her much younger boyfriend, but that she wanted to keep her baby. She says that the shifting status of women in China, especially in terms of their financial independence, has meant that choices can now be made which were not possible just a few years ago. \"Traditionally women relied on men and the family for support. As we earn more, men and women become more equal. Women can even employ people to help them,\" she says. But the vast majority of single women in China are on much lower incomes and remain beholden to the system as it is to support them. The lawyer who's been working on cases relating to women's workplace rights explains that pay during maternity leave is linked to salary. \"For grassroots single mothers their incomes are low,\" she says. \"Without proper, paid, maternity leave they could not survive. It's a very practical issue. \"These days, the government is encouraging families to have more babies. Some provinces even have financial rewards. But, for single mothers, such support is not available. It's highly discriminatory.\" Women who give birth outside of marriage can also face other forms of discrimination, she says. For those in the public service, they may not be able to get political clearance from the Communist Party (certifying that someone is a decent, loyal citizen). The absence of such official approval can mean missing out on promotions or even not getting a government job in the first place. But Prof Yang says she thinks that, as society becomes more tolerant towards unmarried mothers, such discrimination will gradually disappear. If the national government, in the future, requires local officials to more strictly enforce regulations allowing single women to become parents this might also help, she says. As for Zhang Meili, she says this should be a choice for the women themselves. I ask her what advice she would give others who find themselves in the same situation as her and she replies: \"It depends on their personal situation but, if they love kids, they should have them. \"Don't lose a child because of other people's voices or because of questions coming at you from the outside.\"",

        "title": "Ukraine war: Western armour struggles against Russian defences",
        "content": "The general in charge of Ukraine's stuttering counter-offensive in the south has said Russian defences are making it difficult for military equipment, including Western tanks and armoured vehicles, to move forward. Gen Oleksandr Tarnavskyi says his forces are struggling to overcome multi-layered minefields and fortified defensive lines. \"That is why most of the tasks have to be performed by troops.\" He says Russia's military has displayed \"professional qualities\" by preventing Ukrainian forces from \"advancing quickly\". \"I don't underestimate the enemy,\" he adds. Latest unconfirmed reports from the US suggest the main thrust of the counter-offensive has begun. The Institute for the Study of War says Ukrainian forces appear to have broken through \"certain pre-prepared Russian defensive positions\". But so far there's little evidence that Western supplied tanks and armoured vehicles have been able to tip the balance decisively in Ukraine's favour. Several Leopard tanks and US Bradley fighting vehicles were damaged or destroyed in the first days of the offensive, near the city of Orikhiv. Ukraine's 47th Brigade, which had largely been trained and equipped by the West to try to break through Russian lines, were soon stopped in their tracks by mines and then targeted by artillery. Russia released multiple videos of the incident claiming Ukraine's offensive had already failed. In reality it was an early setback rather than a decisive blow. We visited the same brigade's outdoor workshop, hidden in a forest behind the front line, where they are now trying to repair more than a dozen armoured vehicles - most of them US Bradleys. They first arrived unscathed but now bear the scars of battle. Broken tracks and buckled wheels - the tell-tale signs that several have hit Russian mines. Serhii, one of the engineers, says: \"The faster we can repair them, the faster we can get them back to the front line to save someone's life.\" But he also admits that some are beyond repair and will have to be either scavenged for spare parts or \"returned to our partners\" to be rebuilt. While Western armour has provided Ukrainian troops with better protection, it has not been able to punch through the rows of Russian mines - one of the biggest barriers for Ukraine's advance. Travelling the southern front we also saw British supplied Mastiff armoured vehicles damaged and destroyed. The 47th Brigade is now using some of its older, Soviet-era tanks to clear minefields. But they too can't escape the explosives hidden in the ground, even when fitted with specialist mine-clearing equipment. Nearer the front line, tank commander Maksym showed us his recently-damaged T-64 tank. It's been fitted with two rollers on the front to deliberately set off the mines. He lost one of the rollers the night before as he was trying to clear a path for troops. \"Normally our rollers can withstand up to four explosions,\" he says. But the Russians, he adds, have been laying mines on top of each other to destroy their mine clearing equipment. \"It's very hard because there are too many mines,\" Maksym says, adding that there were often more than four rows of minefields in front of the Russian defensive lines. It's been painful to watch the battle unfold for Doc and his drone reconnaissance team from Ukraine's Volunteer Army. Doc, his call sign, took part in last year's successful offensive on Kherson. But he says this time it's proving to be much tougher. For the first time in the war, he says, soldiers are being injured by mines more than artillery: \"When we go forward we meet minefields everywhere.\" Doc shows me a video he recently filmed from one of his drones while Ukrainian troops advanced towards a Russian trench. There's a massive explosion as soon as the soldiers enter. The trench was empty but rigged with mines. Doc says Russian forces are now using remotely controlled mines. \"When our soldiers get to the trenches they push a button and it blows up, killing our friends.\" He says he's seen the tactic being used over the past two weeks and calls it \"a new weapon\". There is a military logic to Ukraine's offensive in the south. It's seen as key to dividing Russian forces and reaching the occupied cities of Melitopol and Mariupol - all the way to Crimea. But the focus on this axis means that Ukraine is also now attacking Russian defensive lines where they're strongest. Gen Tarnavskiy said his forces were doing \"hard and painstaking work\". He said \"any defence can be broken but you need patience time and skilful actions\". Ukraine was slowly wearing down their enemy, he said. Russia didn't care about losing men, and recent changes in their military leadership \"means everything is not OK\", he added. He insisted that Ukraine had yet to commit its main strike force. \"Slow or not, the offensive is taking place and it will definitely reach its goal,\" he says. I ask Gen Tarnavsky how we can judge whether it's a success or a failure? He smiles and replies: \"If the offensive were not successful, I wouldn't be talking to you now.\"",

        "title": "Pakistan explosion: Eyewitness describes doomsday scenes",
        "content": "\"Doomsday scenes\" unfolded in Pakistan after a suicide bomber targeted a political rally, killing at least 45 people, an eyewitness has told the BBC. People screamed for help as rescuers rushed to the scene in the north-west Bajaur district on Sunday, rally organiser Imran Mahir said. The attack targeted the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), a party that is part of the government coalition. A person standing next to me died. Another was injured,\" Mr Mahir said. \"It was a big sound. I initially thought there was a problem with the generator or the sound system. My ears have been ringing and hurting. My head is still hurting.\" Hundreds had turned up for the rally, which was an opportunity for the Islamist JUI-F to rally its support ahead of an election expected to take place later this year. Mr Mahir, who was seated on the stage when the bomb was detonated, described how the explosion unleashed flames and pellets on the crowd that gathered in the town of Khar, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. \"I saw the injured and dead around me. It was very bad situation - it was like doomsday. Soon after the blast there was a panic, it was chaos, people running everywhere,\" he said. \"I don't know why I wasn't injured, it was my luck, my time wasn't over yet. There was a man in his 80s far away from the explosion but he passed,\" he said. Officials have warned the death toll may rise further, as 15 people are in critical condition. A regional leader of the JUI-F, Maulana Ziaullah, was among the fatalities, local officials told the BBC. \"We never thought it would happen to political workers or students and they would do such a big explosion. It was not in our mind, we weren't even thinking of it,\" Mr Mahir said. He said he had been to seven burials overnight. Mr Mahir said however, that morale within the JUI-F ranks remains \"strong and high\", adding, \"We are not going to stop contesting seats, we will carry on. We will face the future\". Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned those responsible as being terrorists who have \"targeted those who speak for Islam, the Quran and Pakistan\" and said they would face \"real punishment\". While no-one has yet said they carried out the attack, the local branch of Islamic State group (IS) in Pakistan claimed to be behind several attacks this year in Bajaur and has previously claimed targeting JUI-F. In June, the militants said they were behind the assassination of a party official in the village of Inayat Killi. The Pakistani Taliban (TTP) has condemned the attack and denied any involvement. In recent years attacks the TTP and other militant groups have been on the rise again in north-west Pakistan after the Afghan Taliban gained power in neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021. The TTP resumed attacks after ending a ceasefire last November.",

        "title": "Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia",
        "content": "Ukraine's counter-offensive appears to be intensifying along sections of the front line but Kyiv warns progress is likely to remain slow. Here are the latest developments: Ukraine has continued its counter-offensive operations, and says its troops have had success on one of the front lines in the south east, taking the village of Staromaiorske, in Donetsk, about 150km (90 miles) east of city of Zaporizhzhia. And the US-based Institute for the Study of War said an \"intense frontal assault\" had also been launched towards Robotyne, in the Zaporizhzhia region, about 10km (6 miles) south of the town of Orikhiv. Unnamed US defence officials have told American outlets that a new push has begun in the Ukrainian counter-offensive. This has not been confirmed by Ukraine although Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters in St Petersburg that attacks by Ukrainian troops had \"significantly\" intensified. He insisted Ukraine had had no success, adding: \"All counter-offensive attempts were stopped, and the enemy was pushed back with high casualties.\" But Russian-backed militia leader Aleksandr Khodakovsky contradicted Mr Putin, saying Ukraine had methodically shelled Staromaiorske for several days and made gains, holding on to the outskirts and pushing on. Elsewhere on the front line, fighting has continued around what is left of the city of Bakhmut - which has endured some of the heaviest fighting of the war and has been under Russian control for several months. Ukrainian officials said fighting is ongoing south west of the city near villages including Andriivka. Ukraine's counter-offensive began on a number of fronts last month but has seen very few clear gains so far. Kyiv's generals have warned that fast results are almost impossible because of Russia's fortified defensive lines and rows of minefields. Gen Oleksandr Tarnavskyi says Russia's military has displayed \"professional qualities\" by preventing Ukrainian forces from \"advancing quickly\", but added: \"Any defence can be broken but you need patience, time and skilful action.\" Meanwhile, Russia has continued to target Ukraine's port and grain infrastructure, destroying a historic cathedral in Odesa in missile strikes, officials have said. Russia claimed its targets in the port city were being used to prepare \"terrorist acts\" and blamed the attack on Ukrainian air defences. Odesa head Oleh Kiper said in his Telegram channel that Russia had also attacked infrastructure at Ukrainian ports of Reni and Izmail on the River Danube for four hours with Iranian-made drones on Monday - just across the river from Nato-member Romania. Moscow has been launching near-constant attacks on Ukraine's grain infrastructure since Russia withdrew from a landmark grain deal - officials in Ukraine say more than 60,000 tonnes of grain have been destroyed. The deal was struck in July 2022 between Russia and Ukraine - brokered by Turkey and the UN - allowing cargo ships to sail along a corridor in the Black Sea 310 nautical miles long and three nautical miles wide. Mr Putin says the West was not keeping its side of the bargain and has offered Russian grain to six African countries - Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, Central African Republic and Eritrea - but has been urged to renew the deal at a summit of African leaders he is hosting. Russia's invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022. Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv. Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol. But they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition. Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance. By October the picture had changed dramatically and having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. More than a year since the invasion, Ukraine is now hoping its latest counter-offensive can turn the war in its favour.

To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project. To show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using updates from the UK Ministry of Defence and BBC research. The situation in Ukraine is often fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.",

        "title": "Riad Salameh: Lebanon's tainted central bank chief steps down",
        "content": "Lebanon's central bank chief has stepped down as planned after 30 years, leaving the country facing an almost total collapse of its economy. Riad Salameh is widely blamed for a crisis which has seen soaring inflation and the currency lose 98% of its value. Once respected for helping the economy recover after Lebanon's civil war, he is now being investigated for embezzlement in several countries. His deputy, Wassim Mansour, will take over as interim head of the bank. Lebanon's caretaker government has failed to appoint a permanent successor. Mr Salameh was appointed governor of Lebanon's central bank in 1993, and was initially credited with bringing stability to the economy. But in recent years he has - along with Lebanon's political class - been accused of large-scale financial mismanagement. His policy of borrowing new money to pay existing creditors has been compared to a Ponzi scheme - an accusation he denies. The current financial crisis began in 2019 when the value of the Lebanese pound plummeted and inflation soared. Since then, the country has been in the midst of one of the world's most prolonged and acute economic crises, with more than 80% of the population living in poverty. Bank withdrawals of hard currency are limited, meaning people are blocked from accessing their savings. Such is the desperation, that some have resorted to holding up banks in an attempt to get their hands on their own money. Mr Salameh also faces several criminal probes. He is being investigated by at least seven countries, including Lebanon, for embezzlement and illicit enrichment. It is claimed he laundered more than $300m (\u00a3229m). He says he did not. \"I have presented audited statements on my personal accounts showing that all my wealth is from my personal work that I did for 20 years in the private sector,\" he told the BBC in a recent interview. France and Germany have seized some of his assets and issued arrest warrants for him. In a news conference on Monday, the central bank's new interim governor, Wassim Mansour, said the bank would impose restrictions on when to lend to the government. He also called on the government to make reforms, calling it Lebanon's \"last chance\" to make changes.",

        "title": "Afghanistan: Taliban burn \u2018immoral\u2019 musical instruments",
        "content": "The Taliban have burned musical instruments in Afghanistan, claiming music \"causes moral corruption\". Thousands of dollars worth of musical equipment went up in smoke on a bonfire on Saturday in western Herat province. Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed numerous restrictions, including on playing music in public. Ahmad Sarmast, Afghanistan National Institute of Music founder, likened their actions to \"cultural genocide and musical vandalism\". \"The people of Afghanistan have been denied artistic freedom\u2026 The burning of musical instruments in Herat is just a small example of the cultural genocide that is taking place in Afghanistan under the leadership of the Taliban,\" Dr Sarmast told the BBC. Some of the items set ablaze in Herat included a guitar, a harmonium and a tabla - a kind of drum - as well as amplifiers and speakers, according to images online. Many of these had been seized from wedding venues in the city. All forms of music were banned from social gatherings, TV, and radio while the Taliban were in power in Afghanistan from the mid-90s until 2001. A music scene flourished in the two decades that followed, but the Taliban's return in August 2021 prompted many musicians to flee the country. Singers and musicians still in the country are reported to have been subjected to beatings and discrimination. In the past two years, the Taliban have imposed other severe restrictions under their strict interpretation of Islamic law. Women have borne the brunt of these harsh measures. The Taliban have decreed they should be dressed in a way that only reveals their eyes, and must be accompanied by a male relative if they are travelling more than 72km (48 miles). Teenage girls and women have also been barred from entering school and university classrooms, gyms and parks. Last week all hair and beauty salons across the country were ordered to shut on the Taliban's orders, after being deemed un-Islamic.",

        "title": "Niger coup: Ousted President Mohamed Bazoum meets Chad's leader",
        "content": "Niger's ousted president has been seen for the first time since the military detained him after staging a coup last week. Mohamed Bazoum met Chad's leader Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by Itno in Niger's capital, Niamey. Mr D\u00e9by is spearheading mediation efforts to end the crisis after West African leaders gave the junta a seven-day deadline to give up power or risk military action. He also met the head of the junta. Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, the head of the presidential guards unit, declared himself Niger's new ruler on Friday. Mr D\u00e9by said his mediation effort was aimed at finding a \"peaceful solution to the crisis which is shaking\" Niger, which borders Chad. He did not give further details, but his office released a photo of him sitting next to a smiling Mr Bazoum. Mr D\u00e9by was himself put in power by the army after his father was killed fighting rebel forces in 2021. He was sent to Niger by leaders of the West African regional bloc, Ecowas, who said on Sunday that the junta had a week to return power to the elected president. The regional bloc would \"take all measures necessary to restore constitutional order\" if its demands were not met. \"Such measures may include the use of force,\" and military chiefs were to meet \"immediately\" to plan for an intervention, a statement added. The junta has not commented on the demands, but it has vowed to defend Niger from any \"aggression\" by regional or Western powers. It has accused former colonial power France of planning military intervention. France and the US both have military bases in Niger. The junta also announced that it is suspending the export of uranium and gold to France with immediate effect. Niger is the world's seventh largest producer of Uranium. The coup has prompted concern that Niger, a key Western ally in the fight against jihadist groups in West Africa, could pivot towards Russia. Neighbouring Burkina Faso and Mali have both moved away from France, and towards Russia, after staging their own coups in recent years. On Sunday, protesters outside the French embassy in Niamey chanted \"Long live Russia\", \"Long live Putin\" and \"Down with France\", AFP news agency reports. They also set fire to the walls of the embassy compound. France would not tolerate any attack on its interests in Niger, and would respond in an \"immediate and intractable manner\", President Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement.",

        "title": "Women's World Cup: Euphoria in Philippines after historic campaign",
        "content": "The Philippines has bowed out of the Women's World Cup after a euphoric campaign that united a country where football is not the national sport. It was a \"magical\" debut that saw the country's first World Cup goal and gave birth to new sport idols, the Philippine Football Federation said. The Filipinas lost to Norway 6-0 on Sunday, five days after handing hosts New Zealand a shock 1-0 loss. Filipinos cheered their new sports heroes, who vowed to return stronger. Coach Alen Stajcic praised the team, many of whom are Filipino-American, for punching \"so far above their weight\". \"They are a classy team and they picked us apart. We tried hard all the way to the end and I am proud of the heart and spirit of our team,\" he said. Striker Sarina Bolden, who scored the country's historic first World Cup goal during the match with New Zealand, said on Sunday: \"As is how football goes, things [don't always] go in your way.\" \"In the New Zealand game, everything was going in our way but now we feel the pain of things not going in our way. And we just learn and we grow from here,\" she said. The Filipinas' supporters showed up in full force on Sunday, making up the majority of the 35,000 spectators at New Zealand's national stadium. Back home in the Philippines, the country's largest shopping mall operator, SM Supermalls, organised viewing parties that attracted large crowds despite monsoon rains. Supporters flooded social media with praises and encouragement. \"Herstory was made because of you, Filipinas! Thank you for raising our flag and making us feel the joy of being Pinoy. We're proud of you,\" Filipino fast-food chain Jollibee posted on Facebook. Pinoy is slang for Filipino. \"The Philippines will forever be one of the stories of the [2023 Women's World Cup],\" wrote Instagram user Junn Monte De Ramos. \"It doesn't matter that they haven't qualified for the knockout stage. They've inspired millions of Filipino female footballers back home\u2026 which is a far greater victory,\" he wrote. The Philippines fell behind early on Sunday night after three goals to Norway in the first half. An own goal and a penalty widened Norway's lead to 5-0 early in the second half. The Filipinas were overwhelmed 6-0 by the end of the match, bowing out of their historic World Cup campaign with one win and two losses, while Norway advances to the round-of-16. The Philippine Football Federation said the team's \"magical journey\" in the World Cup is \"just the beginning\". Mr Stajcic has called on Filipino sports authorities to increase investments in football to give the country a stronger shot in future tournaments, AFP reported. Since the 49-year-old was appointed as head coach in late 2021, the Filipinas' have jumped from 68th in the FIFA world rankings to their current and best-ever 46th place. Former player Camille Rodriguez has also urged sponsors to continue supporting the Filipinas so that their World Cup appearance will not be a one-off. \"It shouldn't just be in this World Cup that we do things right, but in the days after the World Cup,\" she said in a report by local media company ABS-CBN. Football is a niche sport in the Philippines where the most popular sports are basketball, due to the US occupation, and boxing, buoyed by superstars like Manny Pacquiao. The Filipinas' World Cup campaign has reignited interest in football, as seen in a jump on internet searches for the team and their merchandise. It is a level of popularity not seen since the 2010s, when the men's national team, known as the Azkals, went on an Asian winning streak. Unlike the women however, they did not reach the World Cup.",

        "title": "Ukraine war: 'People call us the Ghosts of Bakhmut'",
        "content": "Ukrainian forces are trying to retake the city of Bakhmut in the country's east. The BBC was given exclusive access to a team of elite snipers, referred to as \"the Ghosts of Bakhmut\", who are conducting night raids nearby. Ghost, the sniping team's commander, takes us to the place he calls the \"edge of existence\" - their base on the outskirts of the city. \"Ghost is my call sign,\" he tells me. \"When we started bringing terror to Bakhmut, we got the name 'the Ghosts of Bakhmut'.\" Their base is already well within the range of Russian artillery. Ghost doesn't flinch at the crump of a shell landing nearby. \"The artillery always makes people worry,\" he says. \"You can hide from artillery, but not from a sniper\". The Ghosts, a team of about 20 soldiers, have been operating on the edges of Bakhmut for the past six months. They often hunt for high-value targets. I ask Ghost how many Russians his team have killed. He says, \"There's a confirmed number - 524. Seventy-six of those are mine.\" The team electronically records every shot through the sights of their rifles. Not everyone's keeping count, though. Kuzia, the marksman for tonight's mission, says: \"It's nothing to be proud of. We're not killing people, we're destroying the enemy.\" Before the war, he worked in a factory. He says he never liked guns, but felt compelled to take up arms when Russia invaded. Kuzia does one final check of his US-made Barrett sniper rifle: \"Each mission is dangerous, when we make a mistake the enemy can hit you,\" he says. \"Of course I'm scared - only a fool wouldn't be.\" On tonight's mission he'll be accompanied by Taras, his spotter. Kusch is the driver - who'll bring them as close as possible to the front line. From there the two-man team will have to walk more than a mile to reach their target. Ghost will remain back at the base, along with the rookie, known simply as the Brit. The youngest member of the team got the name after receiving his initial training in the UK. He's yet to have his first confirmed kill. Ghost says he's handpicked every member of the team based on their \"humanity and patriotism\" rather than their military experience and skills. As dusk approaches the team climbs into their armoured Humvee. I, and cameraman Moose Campbell, will accompany them to the drop-off point. Kusch, the driver, tells us that part of the route is still being targeted by Russian artillery. As he starts the engine the team all give themselves the sign of the cross. Kusch starts to play some music from his phone. He says the Ukrainian rap song gets them in the mood. But it'll also mask the sound of the shelling. At first it's hard to hear the explosions nearby because of the rattle of the Humvee, which Kusch drives at speed over pot-holed tracks. But he points to the sky several times and warns, \"incoming\". There are a few thuds nearby. We pass half a dozen wrecked Ukrainian armoured vehicles that weren't so fortunate. Kusch points to minefields on either side of the dirt track. Twenty minutes later we come to an abrupt halt close to a ruined house. The two-man sniper team open the doors and disappear towards a tree line. Kusch shouts out, \"God be with you\" before making a fast exit. As we return there's a flash of orange and a louder explosion. The Humvee starts to rattle even more. Kusch opens his door, while driving, to look behind and lets out a stream of swear words. A piece of shrapnel has shredded one of the back tyres. It's a nerve-wracking hobble back to base. When we finally return he shows us the large piece of jagged metal which tore apart the tyre. It's now dark and the shelling has subsided. Inside their base they anxiously hold on to their radios for news from the sniper team. Kusch and the Brit pace the floor. Ghost makes a phone call to his seven-year-old daughter. She's on speaker when she excitedly shouts, \"I love you daddy\". It's a brief burst of normality - but he's already taught her how to strip a gun. Seven hours later, with little sleep, it's time for the extraction. We shelter in the building while there's a volley of incendiary fire, and then make our way back into the Humvee. This time it's dark, but Kusch tries to drive from memory - avoiding turning on the headlights to attract attention. Another abrupt halt and the two-man sniper team gets back inside the Humvee. The relief is palpable when we get back to their base. Kuzia says: \"One shot, one target.\" Later they show us the video from the night-scope. They say it was a Russian machine-gunner who'd been firing at Ukrainian troops near the front line. They'll rest now until the next night's mission. Kuzia says: \"I'm happy to be back and happy that everyone's alive\". Over the past six months several of the team have been injured, including the commander Ghost. But none of them has been killed. Ghost says \"every trip may be our last, but we're doing a noble deed\". One small team of snipers won't win this war, or even take back Bakhmut. But they believe they're having an impact. Kusch says it has a psychological effect on their enemy - hunting down one Russian soldier at a time from a place that can't be seen and with a sound that can't be heard.",

        "title": "Rivals' silence at Iowa dinner shows Trump's dominance in 2024 race",
        "content": "On the night a dozen of Donald Trump's Republican rivals spoke at the same event in Iowa, only one challenged the former president head on - and he was roundly booed. It highlights the grip Mr Trump still has on his party. Someone backstage at the Lincoln Dinner clearly had a mischievous sense of humour. As each of the candidates hoping to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee for 2024 walked out to speak they were accompanied by a blast of music: a clip of the country song Only In America. When it was Mr Trump's turn, two lyrics, describing two alternative paths that could await someone in the US, seemed particularly poignant: One could end up going to prison One just might be president The 45th President of the United States didn't seem to mind. He doesn't try to hide from the fact that he is already facing two criminal trials and may soon be indicted in two more cases. In fact, he wears these charges as a badge of pride. Mr Trump insists he is being unfairly targeted for purely political reasons. He told the crowd of 1,200 Republican supporters at this dinner in Iowa - a key state because it will hold the first election in the race for the nomination next January - that he would not have been prosecuted if he was not running for the White House again. And he would not have been prosecuted if he was not winning. Using serious criminal charges as a mark of success takes chutzpah. But that is something Mr Trump has always had in spades. And it leaves his opponents deeply confused about how to respond. Most simply chose to ignore Thursday evening's news that Mr Trump had been charged with three more counts in the classified documents investigation. In fact, they declined to take the opportunity to challenge the clear frontrunner in the contest at all. One of the lesser known contenders, Will Hurd, did take a shot. The former Texas Congressman and CIA officer claimed Donald Trump was not running to make America great again. \"Donald Trump is not running for president to represent the people that voted for him in 2016 or 2020. Donald Trump is running to stay out of prison.\" Loud boos and rattling cutlery nearly drowned out the rest of what he had to say, with one man shouting \"go home\". It was clear he had lost the room. Stacey Taiber, one of many Republican voters wearing Trump stickers, told me she did not believe any of the charges against Mr Trump. If the political establishment were \"trying so hard to get him out of the way they must be terrified he will beat Joe Biden\", she said. Her husband, Dan, said it was President Biden and his son Hunter who should be facing criminal trials. He and many others in the ballroom repeated unproven allegations about Hunter's business dealings and claims of foreign influence (which the White House has dismissed but Republicans in Congress are investigating). There was no fun to be had watching the different candidates interacting with each other at the dinner. They each had their own backstage suite which they popped out of to deliver their 10-minute speech. They actually didn't have to see each other at all. Maybe there will be more fireworks when the candidates come face to face at the first Republican debate on 23 August - although Mr Trump has suggested he might skip it because he is so far ahead in the polls. Chris Sununu, the Republican governor of New Hampshire, is no fan of the former president but recently ruled himself out of running against him in 2024. He told me that for the other candidates to compete with Mr Trump it is not about what they say - because there are not significant policy differences - it is about how they perform. \"They need to be exciting, bring some passion, show some emotion, and they need a bit of humour and charisma.\" Who voters like and who they think can win is what matters, he added, noting that it was very hard for newcomers to the national stage to compete with the name recognition and star power of a former president. Vivek Ramaswamy, the millennial entrepreneur and political novice, was one candidate who showed at Friday's dinner that he has the potential to break out from the crowded field of candidates currently polling in single digits. After a barnstorming performance, he got one of the few standing ovations - along with Mr Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the candidate currently sitting in second place in most surveys. Outside the venue there was a stall selling the usual badges, T-shirts and baseball caps. Thirteen candidates appeared on stage (Chris Christie was the only official contender not to attend), but only four of them had their names on the merchandise. Mr Trump, Mr DeSantis and Mr Ramaswamy, along with Tim Scott, the senator from South Carolina who has been getting a bit of attention recently. \"I've been making my living doing this for a long time,\" the vendor told me. \"I know what sells.\" And Republicans have always been strong believers in market forces after all.",

        "title": "Europe fires: The Canadair water bombers battling Mediterranean blazes",
        "content": "\"I hear the Canadairs before I see them. When I do, I know there's a wildfire somewhere very near,\" Adriana says. She lives in Terrasini, near Sicily's capital Palermo. It's a beautiful part of the island - all steep hills giving way to white rocky shores that plunge into the deep blue of the Mediterranean. But like much of southern Europe, Sicily - with its rugged landscape, knotty olive trees and ever-worsening drought - is as flammable as it is picturesque. When a fire begins, it tears through valleys, fields and woodland at speed. Such areas, hard to reach at the best of times, become downright isolated when wildfires break out. \"Only firefighting aircraft can give us reassurance when the flames start,\" says Daniela Arfuso, the mayor of Cardeto, a village perched on the hills of the Calabria's vast Aspromonte national park. The vital role of the amphibious Canadair in particular was brutally highlighted last week when two pilots were killed fighting blazes on the Greek island of Evia. Greek TV showed the Canadair flying low to drop water on a fire before turning sharply into a hillside and bursting into flames. The pilots were named as 34-year-old Cdr Christos Moulas and his co-pilot, 27-year-old Pericles Stefanidis. They have been hailed as heroes and on Thursday the Greek Parliament ruled that Mr Moulas' unborn child would be supported until he was 25, to applause from MPs. \"It's very hard to see for any professional, but especially for Canadair crew. There are not that many of us, and we all more or less know each other, it's a bit of a brotherhood,\" says Giulio Fini, a Canadair commander and the managing director of Avincis Italia, the aerial emergency services company that handles Italy's Canadair fleet. \"When we see scenes like [the crash in Greece], we put ourselves in the pilots' shoes - and our families do too. It's a blow. At the same time, it's motivation to learn to avoid accidents, to improve from a technical point of view.\" The Canadairs operate by scooping up water from either a lake or the sea and releasing it over fires. They are are highly efficient - it takes only 10 to 12 seconds to pick up 6,000 litres of water. A Canadair can make up to 48 drops in three hours. And they are essential in areas like the Mediterranean basin, where airports are few and far between and the type of territory doesn't allow for huge aircraft to operate. Yet only 220 have ever been made since they were launched in 1969. By 2015, they had gone out of production, with the maker blaming a lack of orders. Within a few years, however, it became clear that Europe's increasingly dry and hot summers would require boosted firefighting potential. Production was resumed in 2022, when six southern EU countries placed an order for 22 new planes. Then, earlier this month, the EU - which at the moment leases the planes from individual countries - said it would buy an additional 12 Canadairs, although they won't be available until 2027. Italy has one of the largest Canadair fleets in the world, made up of 18 aircraft and 100 pilots. One of the few Canadair pilot training centres in the world is near Rome, and the only Canadair flight simulator is in Milan. And so, perhaps against its will, Italy has become a centre of excellence in the fight against wildfires - expertise born from an ever-growing sense of urgency. This year alone, almost 30% more land has burned across Europe than the 20-year annual average; in Greece, that number climbs to 83% above average. Last year, Canadair planes dropped more than 153 million litres of water on Italian territory and tackled 2,200 fires. This July alone, Canadair pilots clocked almost 800 hours of work. Cdr Fini tells me that, although most of the work for pilots occurs in the summer, the colder months - which give pilots some respite - are crucial. \"We use winter to prepare for the worst,\" he says. Using data and flight logs from the previous summer, Cdr Fini says his pilots \"study how fire behaves, iron out methods and learn from the previous year: what could we have done better? And we tailor our training accordingly, so that every year we are a bit more prepared.\" Pilots, after all, have to know the elements exceptionally well. They assess things like whether the sea is calm enough to allow the plane to pick up water and study the flora of the area. \"Knowing what kind of greenery is fuelling the blaze, as well as the type of land the flames are burning through, helps us understand how the fire will develop,\" Cdr Fini tells me. There is no room for improvisation. Failing to study the lay of the land or the direction of the winds, for example, could lead pilots into a narrow valley and have thick smoke and ash blown back at them, potentially obstructing their view. Low electrical cables are a death hazard, too, as are burning tree tops. Then, of course, there are human risks. \"We pay a lot of attention to the exhaustion levels of pilots who have to work in very tense conditions in a challenging environment for long days,\" says Cdr Fini. He says his company employs nutritionists who work with pilots and devise a diet plan to ensure they perform at their best on long, hot work days. Nothing is left to chance - even the soles of the pilots' boots are smooth instead of ridged to prevent small rocks that could be blown into the engine from getting lodged into them. But sometimes, all the preparation in the world is not enough, as Cdr Fini knows. He says that one of the \"worst moments\" of his life was eight years ago on the Italian island of Sardinia, where fires tear through hundreds of hectares each year. He had flown one of six Canadairs that spent the day trying to put out a huge wildfire amid high winds. \"The blaze had been so aggressive that I remember telling my co-pilot that it almost felt like we were dropping fuel on the flames rather than water because the fire just kept growing,\" he says. When he got back to the hotel that night, he turned on the news and discovered that two people in the area they had been dousing all day had died in the fire. \"I didn't sleep that night. I felt it had all been pointless,\" he says. People have died in the fires this summer too. By the time firefighters managed to bring a huge blaze in Cinisi near Palermo under control, the fire had already claimed two victims: the bodies of an elderly couple were found in a charred home nearby. Mayor Arfuso says that earlier this week, local residents spent \"long, terrifying nights trying to keep the flames at bay while waiting for dawn to break\" so Canadairs - which can't fly at night - would come to their rescue. I argue that wildfires are formidable enemies, and that surely Canadair pilots deserve admiration. But Cdr Fini pushes back: \"We are not brave heroes. We are professionals,\" he says. \"We know what we can and can't do. We are prepared to face fires because we study them in depth.\" As European summers heat up, the Canadairs will continue to take off - its pilots flying towards what most run away from. \"Protecting land and people is more than just a professional value,\" Cdr Fini says. \"It's what Canadair pilots do. It's in our DNA.\"",

        "title": "Wagner pauses fighter recruitment and focuses on Africa and Belarus - Prigozhin",
        "content": "The head of the Wagner mercenary group says it will continue its activities in Africa and Belarus, but that it is not currently recruiting new fighters. The group was deciding on its next objectives, Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio message published by a Wagner-linked Telegram account. Wagner fighters have played a key role during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In June, several thousand of them took part in a short-lived mutiny against Russia's military leadership. In his audio message, Mr Prigozhin said most Wagner fighters were currently on leave, because \"before that there was a long period of very hard work\". He said the group was deciding on future tasks, which would \"be carried out for the greatness of Russia\". The group would stay \"active in Africa and at training centres in Belarus\", he added in his message - which was published on the Grey Zone account. He did not give further details, although Wagner is known to be active in multiple parts of Africa. Its fighters have also been in Belarus to teach territorial defence forces. \"While we are not experiencing any deficit in personnel, we do not plan to conduct new recruitment,\" Mr Prigozhin said. \"However, we will be extremely grateful if you keep in touch with us, and as soon as the Motherland requires a new group that will be able to protect the interests of our country, we will certainly start recruiting.\" He added there were no restrictions placed on its fighters to transfer to \"other power structures\" of Russia, and \"unfortunately, some\" agreed to do that. After the failed Wagner mutiny on 24 June, President Vladimir Putin invited fighters from the group who did not take part in the uprising to sign contracts with the Russian defence ministry. In other developments, at least four people were killed on Monday morning in the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih after Russian missile strikes, according to the interior ministry. Meanwhile, a drone attack has been reported in Russia's border region of Bryansk - with Governor Alexander Bogomaz saying a police station was hit. On Saturday, Russian officials said three Ukrainian drones were downed in Moscow - the latest in a series of drone assaults on the Russian capital. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin blamed Ukraine for the attack, in which two office blocks were damaged, although there were no casualties. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that war was coming back to Russia, and that attacks on Russian territory were an \"inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process\" of the war between the two countries.",

        "title": "Ukraine war: Front-line troops discuss counter-offensive",
        "content": "As the anaesthetic began to wear off, the Ukrainian soldier - a scrawny, mud-flecked 19-year-old - let out a low wail in the back of the ambulance, then fumbled with his oxygen mask and swore as he mumbled: \"Give me my rifle.\" \"They're often like this. So much trauma,\" said Dr Inna Dymitr, stroking the soldier's pale face as he slipped back into unconsciousness and the ambulance swerved, at furious speed, heading away from the frontlines south-east of Zaporizhzhia. The young soldier's name was Oleh. In a trench that morning, shrapnel from an exploding Russian mortar had dug a large hole in his lower back, quite possibly severing his spinal cord. \"He's stable, but in a serious condition. We get so many like him,\" said Dr Dymitr, listing half a dozen other cases from recent days. She works for a private, Western-funded aid group, MOAS. As the casualties from Ukraine's counter-offensive mount, it is easy to see why - on a rare visit to this closely guarded section of the southern front - some soldiers and observers are starting to wonder if a breakthrough is possible, or whether Russia's defensive lines, built up and heavily-reinforced over the winter months, are simply too much of a barrier. \"Without more [Western] help, I think we might lose this game,\" said Kyrylo Potras, a Ukrainian marine whose lower left leg was torn off by a Russian mine in 2020, but who has now returned to the frontlines. Potras said the presence of vast Russian minefields was proving a huge obstacle. \"These Russians\u2026 there are a lot [of them]. They have many anti-tank guns and missile systems,\" he said. And yet, one month into this long-planned counter-attack, there are plenty of soldiers and experts who vehemently disagree, judging that the opening phase is going according to plan, and that the active frontline - which stretches in a rough arc for more than 1,000km (620 miles) from the Black Sea Coast up to Ukraine's north-eastern border with Russia - was never going to be breached with the same abrupt speed that Kyiv's forces achieved last year. Having spent the last few weeks visiting three separate sections of the front and talking to a range of people, I'm tempted to divide these differing perspectives into three broad groups: those who see Russia's defensive lines as if they're made of tin, those who see them as wood, and those who imagine them as glass. The tin theory - malleable but resilient - was first sketched out for me, more than two weeks ago, by a weary medic I met at a field hospital close to the near-obliterated Donbas town of Bakhmut. Amidst the crash and boom of artillery fire, he described Ukraine's mounting casualties, warned that Russia had had too long to prepare its defences and had too many troops, and concluded that while Ukraine might be able to push the frontline back, perhaps even by tens of kilometres, it would struggle to do more than dent Russia's over-all strategic hold of east and south-eastern Ukraine. \"I think this war will not be resolved in the battlefield. It will end with a political deal,\" he said gloomily. The wood theory - by which I mean a frontline more likely to snap and splinter, but not collapse - was brought home to me some three hours' drive southwest of Bakhmut, beyond the small town of Velyka Novosilka. In the fields and rolling hills that stretch towards the Black Sea, Ukrainian forces were pushing forwards, finding ways through the minefields and attacking Russian positions from unexpected angles, and - slowly, but steadily - capturing significant chunks of territory and several villages and small towns. \"I'm a realist, although some people call me a pessimist,\" said Artem, a 36-year-old soldier, as a Ukrainian jet roared overhead. His view was that Russian troop morale was low, and that Ukraine was likely to make some significant breakthroughs in the coming months. But he could not see the counter-offensive turning into a rout, like it briefly did last November. \"The media and society are in a hurry. [But] the worst option is always possible,\" he added, wondering what sort of \"price\" Ukraine would be prepared to make in terms of the likely casualties involved forcing a strategic break in Russia's frontlines. It is notable that the gloomier perspectives regarding Ukraine's counter-offensive tend to come from soldiers closest to the frontlines and most heavily involved in combat operations. You could argue that they have the most experience and the most realistic views. But it's also reasonable to point out that these soldiers are least able to see the bigger picture, focused, as they are, on small sections of a huge military operation. Which brings me to the glass theory: the view - widely held by prominent western military analysts like Mick Ryan and generals like UK armed forces chief Sir Tony Radakin - that the counter-offensive is on course and that in weeks, or months, Russia's defences will shatter, allowing Ukraine to seize strategically significant territory and to advance close to (if not into) the Crimean Peninsula. This theory's supporters urge patience, not pessimism, arguing that Ukraine's lack of airpower means it cannot do the vital early work of destroying Russia's \"operational system\" - meaning its logistical supply-lines and command centres - with the speed it would like. Instead, Ukrainian forces are using ground-based missiles to do the work, and at the same time attacking Russian positions in as many places as possible in order to tie up, and destroy, as much enemy manpower and equipment as possible. \"Starve, stretch and strike,\" was how Sir Tony, Britain's Chief of Defence Staff, described the strategy in parliament this week, concluding that Russia has already \"lost nearly half the combat effectiveness of its army.\" In another field hospital - where Oleh, the 19-year-old soldier with a severe back injury had briefly been patched up by medics before getting an ambulance ride to Zaporizhzhia - a Ukrainian doctor who asked that we use only his first name, Yevhen, summed up what I would still describe as the dominant, and optimistic, mood of most Ukrainian soldiers and officials I've met here. \"Everyone is waiting for [the breakthrough]. We believe and wait. We know everything will be fine. We just need to be patient,\" he said with a smile, sitting in the sunshine outside the well-organised field hospital, with the boom of outgoing artillery rounds echoing in the distance.

        "title": "David Hunter: British husband who killed wife in Cyprus released",
        "content": "A British man freed by a Cypriot court after being sentenced for killing his seriously ill wife has said he could not find words to describe his release. David Hunter was convicted of the manslaughter of his wife Janice, 74, in an assisted suicide at their Paphos home in 2021 and jailed for two years. The ex-miner, 76, from Northumberland, was freed after spending 19 months in custody awaiting trial. Outside court Hunter thanked his colliery \"family\" for their support. He had told the trial his wife had \"cried and begged\" him to end her life as she suffered from blood cancer. On the steps of Paphos District Court, he told the BBC: \"I'd like to say thank you to all the people who've donated to me, and especially my mates and my workmates. \"I don't know where I would be without them.\" \"When you work in a colliery, you're a family.\" Asked how he was feeling, he said: \"I can't describe it. I'm sorry. I wish I could, I wish I could find words to describe it, but I can't. \"When you're under pressure for two years, not knowing which way it's going to go.\" His legal team had argued he should be given a suspended sentence, in a case which was a legal first in the country. They had initially suggested he would be released by 18 August, but prison authorities freed him on Monday after they officially calculated his release date. In mitigation last week, his defence lawyer Ritsa Pekri said his motive was to \"liberate his wife from all that she was going through due to her health conditions\". The court heard it was Mrs Hunter's \"wish\" to die and that her husband \"had only feelings of love for her\". Hunter, who was originally from Ashington, said he would \"never in a million years\" have suffocated his wife of 52 years unless she had asked him to. He showed the court how he held his hands over Mrs Hunter's mouth and nose and said he eventually decided to grant her her wish after she became \"hysterical\". The court heard he then tried to kill himself by taking an overdose, but paramedics arrived in time to save him. Previously state prosecutor Andreas Hadjikyrou had told the BBC Hunter killed his wife for \"selfish motives\", adding: \"It's himself he was taking care of.\" He had told the court Janice died from asphyxiation, telling three judges it was a \"horrible death\" and her end was \"not painless or peaceful\". Prosecutors said Janice still went to the hairdresser every fortnight which, they said, proved she had a social life and took care of herself. Sentencing Hunter, judge Michalis Droussiotis said the court was \"not facing a typical case\". \"This is a crime that goes against human life, which is the highest virtue. Taking it is a crime,\" he said. \"Before us is a unique case of taking human life on the basis of feelings of love, with the aim of relieving the person of their suffering that came due to their illness.\" The couple's daughter, Lesley Cawthorne, from Norfolk, described the past 19 months as a \"living nightmare\" for the family. \"I thought I'd lost him forever. I cannot believe it. It's amazing. I just didn't think, after the way the case has gone, that this was possible,\" she said. \"I'm elated and relieved that my darling dad has been released. Today is the start of us being able to rebuild our lives. \"Dad's release also means we can finally grieve for my mum and I hope everyone can respect our privacy whilst we take the time to come to terns with her loss. \"So many people have worked hard and supported our efforts to bring my dad home, too many to mention but you know who you are and you know you have our deepest gratitude.\" After talking to her father over the phone, Ms Cawthorne added: \"Speaking to my daddy was the most amazing thing. I feel like my heart has been put back together.\" She said she believes that, rather than returning to the UK immediately, her father will stay in Cyprus so he can visit his wife's grave and \"say his goodbyes properly\". Mrs Hunter is buried a short distance away from the couple's former home in Tremithousa - a quiet village about three miles from the coastal town of Paphos. Michael Polak from Justice Abroad, which has been representing Hunter, said the sentencing had not been straightforward \"given that a case like this has never come before the courts of Cyprus before\". He added his client's release was \"everything we were hoping for\". \"He was facing a charge of premeditated murder, which carries a life sentence which would have resulted in [him] dying in prison here in Cyprus. Then two weeks ago he was found guilty of manslaughter,\" he said. \"The judge gave a very balanced view of the case [today], talking about the sanctity of life but also speaking about the particular circumstances of this case. \"They'd been together for over 50 years. It was a loving relationship. \"When you've got someone there asking you to end their life because they're in so much pain, to make that decision must have been immensely difficult. \"It's a decision that we all hope we're never going to have to make in our own lives.\" A plea deal, which would have seen Hunter admit manslaughter, was agreed with prosecutors in November but the murder trial went ahead after a U-turn by Cypriot authorities.

        "content": "Cardi B became the latest star to be hit by an object from the crowd during a concert, when an audience member threw their drink at the rapper. The 30-year-old reacted by throwing her microphone at the concertgoer from the stage. Although the rapper no longer had a microphone, her voice was still heard on speakers during the performance suggesting she had been lip syncing. BBC News has asked representatives for Cardi B for comment. The incident took place in Las Vegas and was caught on camera from multiple angles by several fans. In the footage, security staff are seen surrounding the perpetrator and recovering the rapper's microphone. However, footage from earlier in the concert showed Cardi B asking a different member of the audience to spray her from behind, as she turned her back to the crowd. Later in the show, the rapper explained the earlier spray had been done on her back and under her own instruction, whereas she objected to the other member of the crowd unexpectedly throwing water which hit her face. This is the latest example of performers having their shows interrupted by someone in the crowd throwing something on stage. In June, Bebe Rexha was hurt when a man threw his phone on stage, hitting her in the face. The man, named as 27-year-old Nicolas Malvagna of New Jersey, was later charged with with two counts of assault in the third degree, one count of harassment in the second degree, one count of aggravated harassment in the second degree, and one count of attempted assault in the third degree. In November, Harry Styles was hit in the eye with a sweet at a gig, and Pink looked uncomfortable when a bag of human ashes was thrown on stage while she was performing in London. Last year Cardi B admitted two offences arising from a brawl in a strip club, as part of a deal to avoid a trial and possible jail time. At the time she said \"I've made some bad decisions in my past that I am not afraid to face and own up to.\" Cardi B is best known for hits such as I Like It, Up, Bodak Yellow and WAP - a duet with Megan Thee Stallion.",

The shooting took place around 5:30 local time (3:00 GMT) on a train travelling from Jaipur in the western state of Rajasthan towards Mumbai city in Maharashtra. Mr Kumar first opened fire on Tikaram Meena, an assistant sub-inspector with the RPF, before shooting three other passengers, according to an RPF statement. The incident occurred just after the train passed the town of Palghar, around 96km (60 miles) from the state capital, Mumbai. Mr Kumar then pulled the in-house alarm chain - used to stop trains in case of emergencies - and tried to escape, according to a statement from the Western Railways. He was arrested in the outskirts of Mumbai. A top official of the Western Railways told reporters that there didn't seem to be any argument between Mr Kumar and others before the shooting. \"It seems like he was not well,\" he said.

        "title": "Australia army helicopter crash: No hope of survivors, minister says",
        "content": "There is no longer any hope of locating survivors from a military helicopter crash, Australia's defence minister says. A significant amount of wreckage was recovered, pointing to a \"catastrophic incident\", Richard Marles told reporters on Monday. The crash happened during a multinational military exercise off Lindeman Island on Friday night. Australian authorities have launched a full investigation. Australia's army chief had grounded a fleet of military helicopters after the crash, which left four crew members missing, and now feared dead. Lt Gen Simon Stuart said none of the army's 45 MRH-90 Taipan helicopters - the craft involved in the accident - would be flown again until they were found to be safe. Australia has previously grounded its Taipans for safety reasons. \"We are not flying the MRH-90 today and won't until we think it is safe to do so,\" Gen Stuart told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. Friday's crash happened at about 22:30 local time (12:30 GMT) over the Whitsundays, a group of islands off the coast of Queensland. The missing soldiers onboard the aircraft were identified by the army as Capt Danniel Lyon, Lt Maxwell Nugent, Warrant Officer Class Two Joseph Laycock and Cpl Alexander Naggs. All of them belonged to the Sixth Aviation Regiment, based in Sydney. The helicopter went down during drills as part of Exercise Talisman Sabre, the massive training exercise which gathers 30,000 military personnel from Australia, the United States, and several other nations. Canberra had announced before the crash that it would be replacing its ageing European-made Taipan helicopters with US-made Black Hawks. Officials had complained about having to repeatedly ground the fleet for maintenance and safety issues. As recently as March, the fleet was pulled from the skies after an engine failure in one of the helicopters during a training exercise, forcing the crew to ditch into the sea off the coast of New South Wales. There were no casualties in the March training exercise. The other MRH-90s were returned to operations on 6 April with \"risk mitigations\". Gen Stuart said the current aim was to keep the Taipans in service until 2024 but \"what happens between now and then, from what we learn from this incident, is yet to be determined\". Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the recent crash as a stark reminder \"that there are no safe or easy days for those who serve in our country's name\". US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, speaking in the northern city of Townsville, said the US would provide any assistance it could.",

        "title": "Why Billionaire Jenny Just Thinks Girls Should Learn Poker",
        "content": "Jenny Just is a legit self-made billionaire. She won\u2019t say how many billions, but calls a 2022 estimate of one and a half of them \u201cconservative.\u201d You haven\u2019t heard of her, because until now, she\u2019s had no reason to be out in public; with four kids and four companies, she likes to say, she has had plenty to keep her occupied. Plus, rich people often feel safer with a low profile. But during the pandemic, when her already substantial wealth blew up alongside the number of companies using a financial technology platform she and her husband created, she found a cause close enough to her heart to make her step into the limelight. Weirdly, it\u2019s poker. Specifically it\u2019s teaching 1 million women and girls how to play Texas Hold\u2019em. On the list of challenges that most people acknowledge women are facing in the second quintile of the 21st century\u2014from being shut out of corporate boardrooms to untreated fistulas\u2014the inability to play Texas Hold\u2019em does not rank very high, but Just is all in. Since 2020, she has started a company, Poker Power, hired a staff, woven together a network of female instructors, built an app, bankrolled a number of high-profile events, and introduced about 32,000 women and girls to poker across 40 countries from Monaco to Kenya. \u201cI\u2019m not saying [poker] is the be-all and end-all,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if women don\u2019t get in positions of power, all those other things are going to continue to happen. And if you don\u2019t understand the money and how you as an individual tie back to it, you\u2019re not going to sit in that seat of power.\u201d Just, 55, believes it\u2019s no accident that the gender breakdown among competitive poker players and options traders is pretty similar: less than 10% women. She started her career as an options trader and has had a close-up view of how women perform in high-pressure situations as she has tried to hire them into her investment firm, Peak6. She has noticed two main shortcomings: they\u2019re extremely risk-averse and they\u2019re poor at capital allocation. That is, they lack the confidence to make the calls on when and how much to invest when they don\u2019t have all the information in front of them. \u201cI can see it when I try to bring them in for trading. I can see it when I listen to them trying to raise money for investments,\u201d says Just. \u201cThe biggest weakness for women has been around money.\u201d Some research bears out the overlap between poker skills and cognitive skills common among people who are successful investors. There\u2019s an all-star lineup of trading titans who play poker seriously, from billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya, whose podcast is often devoted to poker, to Greenlight Capital\u2019s David Einhorn, who has won more than $5 million at poker tournaments. And it\u2019s not just moneymen; President Nixon funded his first political campaign with his poker winnings. It\u2019s how President Eisenhower paid for his first uniform. \u201cFor people who are good at the game, poker is not gambling,\u201d says Annie Duke, who, after winning more than $4 million in professional poker, now writes books on decision management and serves as a consultant to finance companies. \u201cThere is an interaction between the way you choose to play the hand and what the return on investment would be.\u201d In Just\u2019s mind, poker mirrors the options market, where you have imperfect amounts of information, but you invest on probable outcomes, and then change your strategy as more information comes in. Options trading, she admits, isn\u2019t an automatic ticket to power, but it\u2019s a useful skill, and one that she has worked hard to introduce to more women. \u201cI tell women, \u2018You don\u2019t have to be a trader the rest of your life. But if you can understand options, you can sit at any table in any industry, in any position, and understand what\u2019s going on with the money. And that\u2019s where all the decisions are.\u201d Just is familiar, as are all executive women, with the statistical glitch wherein more women than men get bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s and PhD degrees than men, and almost half of the MBAs, but the C-suites are still dominated by men. She puts it down\u2014mostly\u2014to a confidence gap. \u201cMy goal is to get girls learning before that first rung on the ladder, where the guy already has comfort taking the risk for the next job,\u201d she says. The way to build confidence, she believes, is to play at taking risks. \u201cThe world is going to change and evolve. I just don\u2019t want women in the backseat,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are going to have to take risks with things.\u201d The Milwaukee-born financier rose to success without the benefit of poker\u2014but with a decent amount of risk. A math whiz, she scored a job at the secretive Chicago-based financial firm O\u2019Connor & Associates right out of college after the interviewer asked her to do a complicated equation in her head and she nailed it. (\u201cLuckily I had a morning interview,\u201d she laughs.) The only daughter in a Catholic family of seven, she thrived on the male-dominated trading floor, and after a flood in 1992 pushed a lot of employees into a room that still had electricity, her skills caught the eye of O\u2019Connor\u2019s celebrated quant, Clay Struve, who took her under his wing. \u201cShe has a rare skill set and rare experience,\u201d says Paul Rowady, a former O\u2019Connor colleague who is now head of research at Alphacution, referring to the training the firm gave employees. \u201cA woman in a male-dominated trading business that\u2019s based on mathematics and computer automation; she speaks a different language than most women.\u201d After O\u2019Connor, which had been bought by Swiss Bank, announced in 1997 that it was moving the options division to the East Coast, Just and another employee, Matt Hulsizer, decided to stay in Chicago, and build another one, Peak6, and about six years after founding the firm, get married. Their pedigrees and their novelty\u2014\u201cI think at that point, it was interesting to get a call from a female,\u201d she says\u2014got them into a lot of rooms. Peak6 grew fast (net revenues were $14.5 million in 1999 and $80.2 million in 2000) and became a holding company for a bunch of other enterprises they bought or started, including an online trading platform called OptionsHouse. In 2012, at the suggestion of the SEC, Peak6 bought the firm that OptionsHouse used as a clearing company, which was on its way to bankruptcy. Just and Hulsizer rebuilt the software and the resulting company, Apex Fintech Solutions, now manages a section of the digital corridor through which many squillions of online trades take place, a thoroughfare that became exponentially busier amid the pandemic restrictions. Peak6 also operates a fund of its own money, which in May reported assets under management of $20.8 billion. In 2021, Apex attempted to go public with a SPAC (partly organized by former Cosmopolitan magazine editor Joanna Coles) that would have valued the company at $4.7 billion, but canceled the transaction amid regulatory complications over its crypto holdings. When pitching the deal, Just told JPMorgan that Apex worked with 15 million accounts, $100 billion in assets, including 2 million crypto accounts (which it has since sold), and with 200 e-trading sites including Webull, Stash, Ally, and SoFi as clients. \u201cJenny is Michael Jordan,\u201d said her husband during the webcast, adding that he felt like Scottie Pippen. \u201cI\u2019m a really good player, but I happened to play with somebody a lot better than me.\u201d For much of Just\u2019s career, she has tried to get women more comfortable around money. Studies have shown that women feel less competent when it comes to finances and are more risk-averse investors, although their performance as traders is equal or better than men\u2019s in the long run. Tired of getting thousands of applications for entry-level positions at Peak6 from men and hardly any from women, Just set up a summer \u201cTrading Experience\u201d camp for undergraduate women about seven years ago. \u201cAll we do is show them that if you\u2019re hardworking, you\u2019re curious, and you\u2019re smart, [options trading] can be a great career,\u201d she says. Learning poker was a way of filling time between trading activities for the campers. The inspiration for teaching teen girls poker arose, as so many revolutions do, from a marital disagreement. In mid-2019, Hulsizer was watching their youngest child, Juliette, lose at tennis and noticed she was reacting to her opponent rather than trying to anticipate her moves. In his frustration he vented to Just that Juliette, then 14, needed to learn how to play poker\u2014which neither he nor his wife played seriously. Just found herself hesitant about her daughter learning the game, and had the epiphany that she would feel no such reluctance about her three sons. So she organized a few lessons for friends\u2019 and colleagues\u2019 daughters and was surprised at the change. Within a few weeks, they went from giggling and sharing chips to competing. \u201cThey were taught to win,\u201d says Just. \u201cIt may not have been natural, but it was easily taught.\u201d She began to learn poker too, and noticed that she started using poker analogies at work. Then Hulsizer started taking lessons. With the enthusiasm of new converts, they decided to make it a more formalized part of the Trading Experience for interns. After a while, some of the traders asked if they could be taught too. Poker Power, which Just cofounded with Juliette, provides a bunch of ways to learn and practice the game. It has developed an app that offers lessons, the ability to practice against a computer, and community games, and the organization also offers classes via Zoom, and occasionally holds in-person events with poker professionals for businesses and their clients, or high school girls. None of the events use real money. Each set of four 60-minute Zoom group classes costs $50, although the curriculum has been extended to schools free of charge. Just says she\u2019s prepared to spend \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to make the business a success. Part of the value for girls is what Just calls \u201ccompound experiences\u201d of failure, so, as with compound interest, they can take on bigger challenges as they learn from losing at the poker table. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have those experiences of trying and failing and taking a risk and failing again, it gets harder and harder as I get older,\u201d says Just. \u201cI always say: if I had poker, I would have taken 10 years of fails out of my career.\u201d At a Poker Power event hosted by BNY Mellon in the former card room of the New York Stock Exchange on International Women\u2019s Day in March, the mood is jubilant. There are cheers and groans as women in business casual try to learn the finer points of Texas Hold\u2019em. After a quick motivational speech by Just, Poker Power\u2019s director of education and technology, AJ Rudolph, gives a brief seminar on what hands have the strongest potential, how much to bet, and such poker jargon as the hole cards (the two cards they\u2019ve been dealt), the flop (the first three cards laid on the table), the turn and the river (the last two table cards, respectively). Poker experts then fan out to each table to deal a few hands for the attendees. Played well, poker is an aggressive game, and the women are coaxed into doubling and tripling the pot, even before the flop. Their appetite for risk has been amplified by free poker chips bearing the faces of such pioneering women as Malala Yousafzai and Frida Kahlo, strict instructions on when to bet, and possibly the open bar. On the surface, the event seems like any other networking event of mid-level executives looking for a mildly buzzed girls\u2019 night out, gussied up with some Girl Power trimming. But the lessons of the evening are persuasive enough that Jen Hensley, 44, a vice president at Con Edison, decided to play a few hands of poker with her three daughters the following weekend. They\u2019re 7, 9, and 12, but why not start early? \u201cAt my prior job, my boss was a very serious amateur poker player. It was a very clear part of his leadership style,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I always thought that was unrelatable. So when I first got the invitation, I was like, \u2018Oh, this is not for me.\u2019\u201d A friend talked her into it, and when she got there, she began to wonder why she had imagined it would be intimidating. \u201cThis idea of really calculating risk is something that I do in my leadership role, without really thinking about it,\u201d she says. Hensley found betting chips a useful proxy for making decisions. \u201cI have been thinking a lot about how you accelerate that rate of change and thinking about risk in that way is helpful,\u201d she says. As the family breadwinner, however, she thinks it might feel different if there were real money on the table. Annie Duke concurs. \u201c[The chips] get you to be caring about the strategy and the way that you\u2019re executing, and not care so much about the money,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you care about the money, that causes you to be risk averse.\u201d She adds, however, that poker is also not really fun until you\u2019re playing for an amount that matters. Even Just, who regularly risks millions of dollars as part of her workday, admits that the only time she has played poker for real money, she thought her heart would beat right through her chest. \u201cIt hurt. It hurt!\u201d she says. For all Just\u2019s enthusiasm and commitment, it is not 100% clear that she has found the cure for the ills she\u2019s trying to address. There are a bunch of very solid reasons women don\u2019t want to play poker. The link between an appetite for risk and testosterone is well-established, and thus the places where people play poker are still notoriously bro-ish. Duke was constantly being asked why she wasn\u2019t home looking after her kids, or if she was spending the grocery money. (And those were the printable questions.) Aggression and ambition are still not seen as likable qualities in women. \u201cWe have young high school girls who get really confident playing with us, and they want to play with the boys,\u201d says Just. \u201cAnd the boys will then be mad when they lose to the girls\u2014but they don\u2019t mind if they lose to the boys.\u201d Nobody knows for sure that the skills learned at the poker table translate into real life. In fact, playing poker has had a negative effect on many lives. According to Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling., about 2% of people who gamble regularly develop a compulsion for it. And the qualities Just wants to inculcate in girls are exactly the ones that can lead to gambling problems, he says: \u201cBeing able to divorce yourself from the impact of losing that money is probably a great thing in lots of other areas. In gambling it\u2019s associated with greater rates of addiction.\u201d Poker Power has some highfalutin claims about what poker can teach women, including how to be more fearless, confident, influential, perceptive, cool-headed, and resilient, but little in the way of scholarship to back up those claims. Studies suggest that good poker players have some of those qualities\u2014especially cool-headedness\u2014and that skill at poker can be learned. Whether those skills kick in when they\u2019re needed has yet to be proved. (Poker Power is in discussions with a few prominent business schools about studying the benefits of the game this fall.) But even if women can be trained to be more aggressive, it\u2019s an open question as to whether that\u2019s a net positive on a trading floor, which already has plenty of alpha-personalities, and might benefit from a different style of thinking. It\u2019s also unclear that society needs more people who are really good at getting other people to believe something that may or may not be true\u2014and to make high-risk decisions based on that belief. (Conversely, however, in an era of increasing disinformation, the ability to spot that kind of bluff might become ever more important.) Just acknowledges that poker has its dark side, but says she\u2019s willing to take that chance to see women become more confident in assessing risk, especially as we enter an era in which such new tools as cryptocurrency and A.I. are pushing humans into unknown territory. One of Just\u2019s favorite sayings is \u201cMoney isn\u2019t everything, but everything is money.\u201d It makes sense, with that worldview, that she believes a strategy game involving dollars and decisions is a powerful weapon in the redistribution of institutional power. But it seems a long way from the problems that most people think keep women down, like the lack of affordable childcare or maternal mortality. By investing her time and money in poker, rather than a more obvious issue, Just is wagering on an unlikely contender. Sometimes those bets are made merely to garner attention. And sometimes they pay off the most. Correction, July 25 The original version of this story misstated the number of people in Just\u2019s family of origin. It is seven, not six.",

        "title": "What Nebraska Sentence for Teen Who Used Abortion Pills Means",
        "content": "Nebraska\u2019s criminal sentencing of a woman who used abortion pills to end her pregnancy has highlighted how prosecutors can use digital data and charge friends and family members in criminal cases related to abortion, taking on new resonance after the fall of Roe v. Wade. Celeste Burgess, 19, was a minor when she was pregnant and had an abortion. Earlier this year, she pleaded guilty to illegally concealing or abandoning a dead body. Last week, a Nebraska judge sentenced Burgess to 90 days in jail. Her mother was also charged; prosecutors accused Jessica Burgess, 42, of buying abortion pills online. She faces up to five years in prison and pleaded guilty to providing an illegal abortion, false reporting, and tampering with human skeletal remains. The Burgess case began before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year and when Nebraska had a 20-week abortion ban in effect. Nebraska has since enacted a 12-week abortion ban. But legal experts think the Burgess case has gained new relevance in the post-Roe era, suggesting the case may be a harbinger of an increase in criminal prosecution of abortion-related cases. \u201cI certainly think we\u2019re going to see a lot more abortion prosecutions. I don't think this case was going to be inspirational, but I do think it\u2019s likely to embody trends we\u2019re going to see elsewhere,\u201d says Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at UC Davis. In the coming years, Republican-led states could push laws protecting the idea of the fetus as a person and imposing additional criminal penalties for those who self-manage abortion, says Rachel Rebouch\u00e9, a law professor at Temple University. \u201cThis is potentially a signal of some really disturbing things to come,\u201d she says. These are three areas to watch after the Nebraska case, according to legal experts. It\u2019s \u201cstriking\u201d that Celeste Burgess received jail time, says Rebouch\u00e9: \u201cThe court made a point to say that this is such a serious case, that it merits a person without any criminal history\u2026 going to jail for three months.\u201d \u201cThe Court specifically finds that while probation is appropriate, confinement is necessary because without this confinement, it would depreciate the seriousness of the crime or promote disrespect for the law,\u201d the judge\u2019s order stated. There\u2019s also been an increased focus on \u201caccomplices\u201d in a post-Roe world, says Sapna Khatri, a clinical teaching fellow at the UCLA School of Law. Texas was at the forefront of this legal trend with its 2021 abortion law, which allows anyone to sue anyone who performs, aids, or intends to aid in an abortion; that may include private citizens who help a family member or a friend to get an abortion. Since Roe fell, other states have followed suit with other laws: Ziegler points to Idaho\u2019s \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d law, which bans adults from helping a minor to get the procedure without parental consent. In Oklahoma, aiding or abetting someone to help them get an illegal abortion can be subject to prosecution. In Missouri, Republican lawmakers tried but ultimately failed in passing a measure that would make it illegal to \u201caid or abet\u201d abortions outlawed in Missouri, even if they were performed in other states. Read More: What Abortion Laws Look Like in the U.S. One Year After the Fall of Roe v. Wade In the past, Republicans have typically stressed that they will go after abortion providers and not pregnant people, but the Burgess case and sentencing is an example of how that isn\u2019t always the case, says Khatri. \"When states say they are not criminalizing abortion, a lot of people will look to this case and see a young woman has been given jail time for basically self managing an abortion\u2014regardless of the context and the legal details,\" says Alina Salganicoff, senior vice president and director of Women\u2019s Health Policy at KFF. With new laws on the books, the country may see more prosecutions of women like Celeste Burgess and those considered to be helping someone get an abortion. Nebraska law enforcement used Facebook messages between the mother and daughter to show how they discussed getting abortion pills and burning the evidence.  Many people assume that direct messages on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter will remain private. They shouldn\u2019t, legal experts say. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy way to communicate and yet it leaves them vulnerable to criminalization,\u201d Khatri says. \u201cLaw enforcement can usually get these records if they have probable cause.\u201d  Law enforcement\u2019s use of digital data in abortion-related cases could have a chilling effect. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fear mongering,\u201d Khatri says. People may end up getting inaccurate information about abortions because \u201cthey\u2019re nervous that searching for this information online will make that search history will end up in the hands of law enforcement.\u201d  Since the fall of Roe, lawmakers have been wary of how prosecutors may use digital data to criminalize abortion. \u201cYour geolocation data, apps for contraception, web searches, phone records\u2014all of it is open season for generating data to weaponize the personal information of women across the country,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and longtime proponent of digital privacy reform, previously told TIME. There have not yet been many examples in the courtroom. In a Texas case, a man sued his ex-wife\u2019s friends in March for helping her get a medication abortion. His case is largely based on text messages he allegedly discovered on his ex-wife\u2019s phone. The following month, her friends counter-sued him for invasion of privacy. The Burgess case marks one of the first times an abortion-related case after the overhaul of Roe has relied on digital data. The Burgess case has renewed attention around medication abortion, which involves two different drugs: mifepristone and misoprostol. Thirteen states have a near-total ban on abortion, which includes abortion medication, and 15 states restrict access to medication abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, as of June 1. While the FDA approves the use of abortion pills up to ten weeks of pregnancy, many states have abortion bans that kick in even earlier and apply to the use of pills, too. The FDA's approval of abortion medication dates back to 2000; it maintains that the method is a safe and effective way to end a pregnancy. (It extended approval of mifepristone from seven to 10 weeks in 2016.) But a group of anti-abortion clinicians sued in federal court in Texas last year, arguing that the FDA wrongfully approved mifepristone. \"It is a significant case not only for its implications on abortion access and medication abortion\u2014it's also the first time a federal court is being asked to overturn an FDA determination about the safety and effectiveness of a drug,\" says Salganicoff of KFF. This could also have implications for vaccines and other drugs, she adds. And any restrictions on the pill could affect its use and distribution where abortion is legal. In April, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit blocked a Texas federal judge\u2019s ruling; the Fifth Circuit said that mifepristone can stay on the market under strict conditions, including banning its distribution by mail and use beyond seven weeks of pregnancy. This order was then appealed to the Supreme Court, which in April blocked both lower court orders and allowed mifepristone to remain available to the public per FDA rules, as the case proceeds through courts. Medication abortion has become increasingly popular over the years, even before Roe was overhauled: as of 2022, more than half of all abortions in the U.S. involve using an abortion pill, according to the Guttmacher Institute. \u201cThey're important because they allow women and girls to end pregnancy, more or less in secrecy,\u201d says Carol Sanger, a Columbia Law professor. \u201cYou don't have to go to Planned Parenthood and get your picture taken by Right to Life groups or go past screaming protesters.\u201d A 2023 Pew survey found that 53% of adults believe medical abortion should be allowed in their states; 22% say it should be illegal, and 24% say they aren\u2019t sure.  While the Burgess case has new resonance after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, there are important caveats to keep in mind. The case is unusual given that the abortion took place so late into the pregnancy: at about 30 weeks, according to court records. Abortions at or after 21 weeks make up only 1% of all abortions in the U.S., according to KFF, and 30 weeks is well past when the FDA approves the use of abortion medication. Burgess was also charged with concealing a dead body, because she and her mother said that they burned and buried the fetal remains. Roe banned laws from establishing fetal personhood before viability, which is around 24 weeks of pregnancy when a fetus can survive outside the womb. Prosecutors have more leeway to criminalize pregnant people in a post-Roe environment, says Nicole Huberfield, a law professor at Boston University. \u201cWhen Roe was the law of the land, we understood that if a state tried to prosecute people prior to viability, that was typically going to be deemed impermissible. Now, we don't have that guardrail.\u201d Still, Burgess had an abortion after the 24-week mark, and her case began while Roe was still in effect. While many red states have passed abortion restrictions and bans since the fall of Roe, there haven\u2019t been many criminal cases against pregnant people or providers. Experts point to multiple possible reasons: It\u2019s still early. Self-managed abortions can be hard to detect. Prosecutors are elected and many people don\u2019t want abortion restrictions to be enforced. There has been little civil disobedience among providers; providing illegal abortions could cost them their medical license. And the legal landscape across the country is quickly evolving.",

        "content": "In the first half of the U.S. Women National Team\u2019s (USWNT) group stage matchup against the Netherlands on Wednesday night in Wellington, New Zealand, American midfielder and co-captain Lindsey Horan found herself exasperated, arms extended, since her teammates missed her open on the pitch. In the second half, Horan found herself chippy, fired up and physical, exchanging pushes with a Dutch player\u2014and pro club teammate\u2014who tackled her too hard. This time, however, Horan would take out her frustration on the soccer ball. With her head. And America averted a World Cup disaster. The game ended in a 1-1 draw: Horan\u2019s second half aerial goal, off a Rose Lavelle corner kick, deadlocked the game in the 62nd minute. The U.S. controlled the game after Horan\u2019s score, failing to convert a few opportunities but walking away with a point. (The Americans held a 17-4 advantage in attempts at goal). Both the U.S. and the Netherlands now have four points in their group. Neither team has yet clinched a place in the knockout round, the result the Americans in particular were surely expecting. Both teams have some work to do in their final group stage games. But both the Americans and the Netherlands are in a strong position to advance. Sign up for \u2018Extra Time,\u2019 our new newsletter that will break down the biggest moments from the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup The Netherlands had taken the lead early. In the 17th minute, the Dutch patiently dissected the U.S. defense and Jill Roord found herself largely unbothered near the top of the 18-yard box. Eight U.S. defenders were in the box with her. But they weren\u2019t close enough to Roord. Her angular strike went through Horan\u2019s legs\u2014she had quite an unpleasant first half\u2014and through the rest of the defense and into the net. The Americans now trailed in a World Cup game for the first time since 2011. In the 47th minute, American defender Crystal Dunn had the ball on her foot, out wide to the left. Four Netherlands players honed in on Dunn. Horan stood in the middle of the pitch, arms extended, incredulous that Dunn wasn\u2019t sending a diagonal pass her way, to push the American attack and perhaps create a much-needed scoring chance against the Dutch. Dunn sent the ball back to Naomi Garma, who also missed Horan, who put her arms out in exasperation for a second time. Dunn got the ball back and pushed it up the sideline\u2014Horan was still open. Dunn and Sophia Smith exchanged passes: Smith, who before the World Cup talked about the singular focus that overcomes her when she sniffs a scoring opportunity, dribbled into the teeth of the Netherlands defense. Horan\u2019s arms went up a third time. Smith lost possession.

For Horan and her teammates, the halftime whistle couldn\u2019t come soon enough. They all needed to regroup. And the switch flipped for the Americans after the break. First off, Lavelle entered the game and provided a spark, almost immediately earning a yellow card for an aggressive tackle. Her instant message: the U.S. would not fall flat in this half. To that end, moments later Danielle van de Donk hit Horan hard. The U.S. co-captain needed some quick treatment on the sideline. When she returned for a corner kick, Horan let van de Donk, her teammate at Lyon, know she didn\u2019t appreciate such roughness. They exchanged trash talk and pushes. The ref tried to get them to make amends. Neither was really having it. Horan, however, got the upper hand: the ensuing corner kick to shut down the chatter. Lavelle lifted the ball towards the box. \u201cRose put in an absolute dime,\u201d Horan said afterwards. Horan leapt and scored the game-tying header. Turns out that the U.S. would avert its first group stage loss since 2011, a year they reached the World Cup final but lost to Japan. When the match ended, Horan and van de Donk exchanged pleasantries and hugged. All\u2019s fair in World Cup competition: the pair could go back to being buddies now. Luckily for the Americans, however, Horan saved the sportsmanship for after the final whistle. She got full-on ticked. At just the right moment.",

        "title": "How Extreme Weather Is Fueling the Political Right",
        "content": "Last weekend, the climate-related headline on the print issue of the New York Post caught my eye during a gas station pit stop. Instead of focusing on the crazy heat and climate extremes that had dominated other outlets, the cover page headline read \u201cabuse of power\u201d and a spread inside claimed that the state\u2019s green policies would soon dramatically raise the cost of electricity\u2014an easy way to rile readers during the summer months when air conditioning is already driving up electricity bills. It made me think, amid the climate-related disruption currently being experienced across the country, will there be a moment that jolts skeptics into action? It\u2019s easy to see how these scenes could lead to some reflection\u2014and some accelerated action\u2014on the threat climate change poses to human life and society. Indeed, over the past decade I\u2019ve heard a similar argument time and again: eventually climate extremes will force skeptics of climate policy to get with the program. It is an optimistic yet reasonable sounding vision. But, if the past few months are any indicator, it seems something closer to the opposite may be happening. As temperatures have spiked, conservative backlash around the world to climate policy may have also reached a fever pitch. In the U.S., former President Donald Trump has turned electric vehicles into a major attack line targeting President Joe Biden. In a late June speech, he called Biden\u2019s policies \u201cenvironmental extremism\u201d and claimed they were \u201cheartless and disloyal and horrible for the American worker.\u2019 In Spain, Vox, the far-right party, campaigned on softening climate policy, among other things, ahead of a national election on July 23. During the campaign, Vox called the country\u2019s 2021 climate law \u201cthe return to caves and poverty\u201d as the country pushes measures like water conservation to help adapt to a warmer planet. The debate over green policies also infiltrated an important bellwether election in Britain. In the Uxbridge constituency outside of London, on July 20, the Conservative Party unexpectedly won a seat in an election dominated by discussion of expanding congestion pricing. Within hours, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that climate solutions should be executed in a way that is \u201cproportionate and pragmatic\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs in their lives.\u201d (Unlike others listed here, Sunak does support the broader aims of the energy transition). Despite the widely held view that experiencing climate change might lead to wider acceptance of climate policy, research on the link between public opinion and climate events is mixed. In short, it\u2019s not clear exactly how or whether extreme weather triggers people to reassess their views on climate change. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it's clear that partisanship matters here. A 2020 paper in the journal Nature Climate Change pointed to a clear dividing line in the U.S. Extreme weather tends to reinforce the link between climate change and weather effects in Democratic and/or highly educated communities\u2014and less so elsewhere. This dynamic means that extreme weather may actually be creating an opportunity for conservatives to cater to their base. As heat waves or flooding raises the specter of climate change for certain groups, others can use it to raise the specter of the costs of climate policy to rally their most loyal supporters who are primed to oppose it anyway. Politicians and commentators are searching for answers. In Britain, for example, the Labour Party has rolled back its signature green policy amid this consternation. But some analysts are advocating for another approach: keep the policy and get a better message. After all, a world where extreme weather events lead to a backtracking in climate policy would be a scary one indeed. A version of this story also appears in the Climate is Everything newsletter.

        "title": "A Hive Mind of Doctors Means Better Care for Patients",
        "content": "If you\u2019re like an unlucky 5% of American adults, you\u2019ll visit a doctor with a medical complaint this year, only to be misdiagnosed and, often, misprescribed a treatment. If you\u2019re like a far less lucky one of 100,000 hospitalized Americans, such a misdiagnosis will cost you your life. There are a lot of reasons for medical errors: inexperienced caregivers; ambiguous symptoms; understaffed hospitals, underlying conditions.  But according to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), there\u2019s one more little-considered cause: doctors working alone\u2014often with too little opportunity to think and rethink the case. By increasing the number of physicians weighing in on a case, doctors can significantly increase the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis and a favorable result, according to a team of researchers led by Damon Centola, professor and director of the Network Dynamics Group at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication.. \u201cWe are increasingly recognizing that clinical decision-making should be viewed as a team effort that includes multiple clinicians and the patient as well,\u201d said co-author Dr. Elaine Khoong, of the University of California, San Francisco, and the San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, in a statement accompanying the release of the study. Medical collaboration is hardly a new thing. As Centola points out, many hospitals, especially ones in lower-income areas, rely on \u201ce-consult technologies,\u201d in which a clinician sends a message to an outside specialist for a second opinion on a case, with results usually taking 24 to 72 hours to come back. But two minds, Centola and his collaborators theorized, are less effective than a hive mind\u2014and they set out to prove that idea. Recruiting a subject group of 2,941 physicians, the authors divided them into a sample group of 2,053 and a control group of 888. All of the subjects were drawn from one of three specialties: internal medicine, emergency medicine, and cardiology. All of them too were presented with case studies of real-life patients who had presented with illnesses known to have high rates of diagnostic error: acute cardiac events, geriatric care, low back pain, and diabetes-related cardiovascular illness prevention. Then they were set to work diagnosing the cases and prescribing a treatment\u2014a process that was divided into three steps, which both groups conducted in different ways. The 888 members of the control group worked alone. They read the case scenario and were given two minutes (sometimes all a doctor gets in an emergency situation) to provide a risk assessment\u2014how serious the patient\u2019s symptoms were, and what the likelihood of severe illness was\u2014and recommend a treatment. This was repeated two more times, with the members of the control group given a second and a third opportunity to re-read and reconsider the case\u2014again with a two-minute timeline, but at least with greater familiarity of the scenario now\u2014and again recommend a treatment. Read More: AI Cough-Monitoring Can Change the Way We Diagnose Disease Things were very different with the other subjects. The 2,053 members of the sample group were divided into smaller groups of 40 each. All of them began the experiment the same way the control group did\u2014taking two minutes to read, diagnose and recommend a treatment for the case study. They too were given a second chance to analyze the case, but before they did, they were also shown the average risk estimate the other 39 doctors in their group\u2014whose identities were not disclosed\u2014had given for the severity of the case. They could then either stick with their initial assessment of the severity of the condition or change it to one more in keeping with the majority. In the third round they did the same, only this time with their treatment recommendation. Both groups benefited from the opportunity to take multiple looks at the same case. In the control group, the doctors improved from an accuracy rate of 76.8% in the first look they took at the case study to 79.3% by the third\u2014or a 3.3% improvement. The sample group, in which the doctors had the benefit of one another\u2019s insights\u2014doubled the improvement of the control group, going from an accuracy of 76.1% to 81.1%, or a 6.6% bump. (There was no indication in the results of the hive mind in the 2,053-person sample leading the doctors to a collective wrong conclusion.) Over a potential U.S. patient population of 332 million, that 6.6% improvement can mean 21.8 million people. \u201cWe can use doctors\u2019 networks to improve their performance,\u201d said Centola in a statement. \u201cThe real discovery here is that we can structure the information-sharing networks among doctors to substantially increase their clinical intelligence.\u201d What\u2019s more, Centola thinks the 40-doctor model his group hit on is a good one. \u201cForty people in a network gets you a steep jump in clinicians\u2019 collective intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe increasing returns above that\u2014going, say, from 40 to 4,000\u2014are minimal.\u201d What\u2019s more, in the sample group, whose members not only read the case study three times, but also read their peers\u2019 responses, the entire trial still took only 20 minutes\u2014far less than the 24 to 72 hours a single-specialist consultation now takes. Effective as the protocol is, there are obstacles to implementing it widely. The amount of time physicians have to spare on cases that are not their own, and reimbursement policies for their work, are both issues to be resolved. More challenging. Centola says, is changing the culture around the business of diagnosing and prescribing\u2014which is too often seen as an entirely solitary practice. \"This network innovation,\" he says, \"replaces that view of decision-making with the insight that it is also a social and behavioral process that can be improved by structuring the flow of information and influence among clinicians.\" When it comes to saving human lives, speed counts, accurate diagnoses count, and getting the right treatment to the right patient counts. If it takes 40 doctors to get all that right, it\u2019s worth the extra work.",

On Thursday, heat and humidity in major cities along the East Coast, including Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City, created a real feel above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).

The country's largest power grid, PJM Interconnection, declared a level one energy emergency alert for its 13-state grid on Wednesday, meaning the company is concerned about its ability to provide enough electricity. \u201cPJM currently has enough generation to meet forecast demand, but operators continue to monitor the grid conditions for any changes,\u201d said Jeffrey Shields, a spokesperson for the company. PJM isn't the only electrical grid to issue such an alert.

At each tap, the sound of her voice speaking her mother tongue emerges from the phone. Before she started using this app, 30-year-old Chandrika (who, like many South Indians, uses the first letter of her father's name, K., instead of a last name) had just 184 rupees ($2.25) in her bank account.

Right now, cutting edge AIs\u2014for example, large language models like ChatGPT\u2014work best in languages like English, where text and audio data is abundant online. They work much less well in languages like Kannada which, even though it is spoken by millions of people, is scarce on the internet. (Wikipedia has 6 million articles in English, for example, but only 30,000 in Kannada.) When they function at all, AIs in these \u201clower resourced\u201d languages can be biased\u2014by regularly assuming that doctors are men and nurses women, for example\u2014and can struggle to understand local dialects. To create an effective English-speaking AI, it is enough to simply collect data from where it has already accumulated. But for languages like Kannada, you need to go out and find more. This has created huge demand for datasets\u2014collections of text or voice data\u2014in languages spoken by some of the poorest people in the world. Part of that demand comes from tech companies seeking to build out their AI tools. Another big chunk comes from academia and governments, especially in India, where English and Hindi have long held outsize precedence in a nation of some 1.4 billion people with 22 official languages and at least 780 more indigenous ones. This rising demand means that hundreds of millions of Indians are suddenly in control of a scarce and newly-valuable asset: their mother tongue. Data work\u2014creating or refining the raw material at the heart of AI\u2014 is not new in India. The economy that did so much to turn call centers and garment factories into engines of productivity at the end of the 20th century has quietly been doing the same with data work in the 21st. And, like its predecessors, the industry is once again dominated by labor arbitrage companies, which pay wages close to the legal minimum even as they sell data to foreign clients for a hefty mark-up. The AI data sector, worth over $2 billion globally in 2022, is projected to rise in value to $17 billion by 2030. Little of that money has flowed down to data workers in India, Kenya, and the Philippines. These conditions may cause harms far beyond the lives of individual workers. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about systems that are impacting our whole society, and workers who make those systems more reliable and less biased,\u201d says Jonas Valente, an expert in digital work platforms at Oxford University\u2019s Internet Institute. \u201cIf you have workers with basic rights who are more empowered, I believe that the outcome\u2014the technological system\u2014will have a better quality as well.\u201d In the neighboring villages of Alahalli and Chilukavadi, one Indian startup is testing a new model. Chandrika works for Karya, a nonprofit launched in 2021 in Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) that bills itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s first ethical data company.\u201d Like its competitors, it sells data to big tech companies and other clients at the market rate. But instead of keeping much of that cash as profit, it covers its costs and funnels the rest toward the rural poor in India. (Karya partners with local NGOs to ensure access to its jobs go first to the poorest of the poor, as well as historically marginalized communities.) In addition to its $5 hourly minimum, Karya gives workers de-facto ownership of the data they create on the job, so whenever it is resold, the workers receive the proceeds on top of their past wages. It\u2019s a model that doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else in the industry. The work Karya is doing also means that millions of people whose languages are marginalized online could stand to gain better access to the benefits of technology\u2014including AI. \u201cMost people in the villages don\u2019t know English,\u201d says Vinutha, a 23-year-old student who has used Karya to reduce her financial reliance on her parents. \u201cIf a computer could understand Kannada, that would be very helpful.\u201d \u201cThe wages that exist right now are a failure of the market,\u201d Manu Chopra, the 27-year-old CEO of Karya, tells me. \u201cWe decided to be a nonprofit because fundamentally, you can\u2019t solve a market failure in the market.\u201d Read More: 150 African Workers for ChatGPT, TikTok and Facebook Vote to Unionize at Landmark Nairobi Meeting The catch, if you can call it that, is that the work is supplementary. The first thing Karya tells its workers is: This is not a permanent job, but rather a way to quickly get an income boost that will allow you to go on and do other things. The maximum a worker can earn through the app is the equivalent of $1,500, roughly the average annual income in India. After that point, they make way for somebody else. Karya says it has paid out 65 million rupees (nearly $800,000) in wages to some 30,000 rural Indians up and down the country. By 2030, Chopra wants it to reach 100 million people. \u201cI genuinely feel this is the quickest way to move millions of people out of poverty if done right,\u201d says Chopra, who was born into poverty and won a scholarship to Stanford that changed his trajectory. \u201cThis is absolutely a social project. Wealth is power. And we want to redistribute wealth to the communities who have been left behind.\u201d Chopra isn\u2019t the first tech founder to rhapsodize about the potential of AI data work to benefit the world\u2019s poorest. Sama, an outsourcing company that has handled contracts for OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Meta\u2019s Facebook, also marketed itself as an \u201cethical\u201d way for tech companies to lift people in the Global South out of poverty. But as I reported in January, many of its ChatGPT workers in Kenya\u2014some earning less than $2 per hour\u2014told me they were exposed to training data that left them traumatized. The company also performed similar content moderation work for Facebook; one worker on that project told me he was fired when he campaigned for better working conditions. When asked by the BBC about low wages in 2018, Sama\u2019s late founder argued that paying workers higher wages could disrupt local economies, causing more harm than good. Many of the data workers I\u2019ve spoken to while reporting on this industry for the past 18 months have bristled at this logic, saying it\u2019s a convenient narrative for companies that are getting rich off the proceeds of their labor. Read More: OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour to Make ChatGPT Less Toxic There is another way, Chopra argues. \u201cThe biggest lesson I have learned over the last 5 years is that all of this is possible,\u201d he wrote in a series of tweets in response to my January article on ChatGPT. \u201cThis is not some dream for a fictional better world. We can pay our workers 20 times the minimum wage, and still be a sustainable organization.\u201d It was the first I\u2019d heard of Karya, and my immediate instinct was skepticism. Sama too had begun its life as a nonprofit focused on poverty eradication, only to transition later to a for-profit business. Could Karya really be a model for a more inclusive and ethical AI industry? Even if it were, could it scale? One thing was clear: there could be few better testing grounds for these questions than India\u2014a country where mobile data is among the cheapest in the world, and where it is common for even poor rural villagers to have access to both a smartphone and a bank account. Then there is the potential upside: even before the pandemic some 140 million people in India survived on under $2.15 per day, according to the World Bank. For those people, cash injections of the magnitude Chopra was talking about could be life-changing. Just 70 miles from the bustling tech metropolis of Bengaluru, past sugarcane fields and under the bright orange arcs of blossoming gulmohar trees, is the village of Chilukavadi. Inside a low concrete building, the headquarters of a local farming cooperative, a dozen men and women are gathered\u2014all of whom have started working for Karya within the past week.  Kanakaraj S., a skinny 21-year-old, sits cross-legged on the cool concrete floor. He is studying at a nearby college, and to pay for books and transport costs he occasionally works as a casual laborer in the surrounding fields. A day\u2019s work can earn him 350 rupees (around $4) but this kind of manual labor is becoming more unbearable as climate change makes summers here even more sweltering than usual. Working in a factory in a nearby city would mean a slightly higher wage, but means hours of daily commuting on unreliable and expensive buses or, worse, moving away from his support network to live in dormitory accommodation in the city. At Karya, Kanakaraj can earn more in an hour than he makes in a day in the fields. \u201cThe work is good,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd easy.\u201d Chopra says that\u2019s a typical refrain when he meets villagers. \u201cThey\u2019re happy we pay them well,\u201d he says, but more importantly, \u201cit\u2019s that it\u2019s not hard work. It\u2019s not physical work.\u201d Kanakaraj was surprised when he saw the first payment land in his bank account. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of money from scams,\u201d he tells me, explaining that it is common for villagers to receive SMS texts preying on their desperation, offering to multiply any deposits they make by 10. When somebody first told him about Karya he assumed it was a similar con\u2014a common initial response, according to Chopra. Read More: Big Tech Layoffs Are Hurting Workers Far Beyond Silicon Valley With so little in savings, local people often find themselves taking out loans to cover emergency costs. Predatory agencies tend to charge high interest rates on these loans, leaving some villagers here trapped in cycles of debt. Chandrika, for example, will use some of her Karya wages to help her family pay off a large medical loan incurred when her 25-year-old sister fell ill with low blood pressure. Despite the medical treatment, her sister died, leaving the family responsible for both an infant and a mountain of debt. \u201cWe can figure out how to repay the loan,\u201d says Chandrika, a tear rolling down her cheek. \u201cBut we can\u2019t bring back my sister.\u201d Other Karya workers find themselves in similar situations. Ajay Kumar, 25, is drowning in medical debt taken out to address his mother\u2019s severe back injury. And Shivanna N., 38, lost his right hand in a firecracker accident as a boy. While he doesn\u2019t have debt, his disability means he struggles to make a living. The work these villagers are doing is part of a new project that Karya is rolling out across the state of Karnataka for an Indian healthcare NGO seeking speech data about tuberculosis\u2014a mostly curable and preventable disease that still kills around 200,000 Indians every year. The voice recordings, collected in 10 different dialects of Kannada, will help train an AI speech model to understand local people\u2019s questions about tuberculosis, and respond with information aimed at reducing the spread of the disease. The hope is that the app, when completed, will make it easier for illiterate people to access reliable information, without shouldering the stigma that tuberculosis patients\u2014victims of a contagious disease\u2014often attract when they seek help in small communities. The recordings will also go up for sale on Karya\u2019s platform as part of its Kannada dataset, on offer to the many AI companies that care less about the contents of their training data than what it encodes about the overall structure of the language. Every time it\u2019s resold, 100% of the revenue will be distributed to the Karya workers who contributed to the dataset, apportioned by the hours they put in. Rajamma M., a 30-year-old woman from a nearby village, previously worked as a COVID-19 surveyor for the government, going from door to door checking if people had been vaccinated. But the work dried up in January. The money from working for Karya, she says, has been welcome\u2014but more than that, she has appreciated the opportunity to learn. \u201cThis work has given me greater awareness about tuberculosis and how people should take their medicine,\u201d she says. \u201cThis will be helpful for my job in the future.\u201d  Although small, Karya already has a list of high-profile clients including Microsoft, MIT, and Stanford. In February, it began work on a new project for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to build voice datasets in five languages spoken by some 1 billion Indians\u2014Marathi, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali, and Malayalam. The end goal is to build a chatbot that can answer rural Indians\u2019 questions, in their native languages and dialects, about health care, agriculture, sanitation, banking, and career development. This technology (think of it as a ChatGPT for poverty eradication) could help share the knowledge needed to improve quality of life across vast swaths of the subcontinent. \u201cI think there should be a world where language is no longer a barrier to technology\u2014so everyone can use technology irrespective of the language they speak,\u201d says Kalika Bali, a linguist and principal researcher at Microsoft Research who is working with the Gates Foundation on the project and is an unpaid member of Karya\u2019s oversight board. She has specifically designed the prompts workers are given to read aloud to mitigate the gender biases that often creep into datasets and thus help to avoid the \u201cdoctor\u201d and \u201cnurse\u201d problem. But it\u2019s not just about the prompts. Karya\u2019s relatively high wages \u201cpercolate down to the quality of the data,\u201d Bali says. \u201cIt will immediately result in better accuracy of the system\u2019s output.\u201d She says she typically receives data with a less than 1% error rate from Karya, \u201cwhich is almost never the case with data that we build [AI] models with.\u201d  Over the course of several days together, Chopra tells me a version of his life story that makes his path toward Karya feel simultaneously impossible and inevitable. He was born in 1996 in a basti, an informal settlement, next to a railway line in Delhi. His grandparents had arrived there as refugees from Pakistan during the partition of British India in 1947, and there the family had remained for two generations. Although his parents were well-educated, he says, they sometimes struggled to put food on the table. He could tell when his father, who ran a small factory making train parts, had had a good day at work because dinner would be the relatively expensive Maggi instant ramen, not cheap lentil dal. Every monsoon the basti\u2019s gutters would flood, and his family would have to move in with his grandmother nearby for a few days. \u201cI think all of us have a keen recognition of the idea that money is a cushion from reality,\u201d Chopra says of the Karya team. \u201cOur goal is to give that cushion to as many people as possible.\u201d Chopra excelled at the basti\u2019s local school, which was run by an NGO. When he was in ninth grade he won a scholarship to a private school in Delhi, which was running a competition to give places to kids from poor backgrounds. Though he was bullied, he acknowledges that certain privileges helped open doors for him. \u201cAs difficult as my journey was, it was significantly easier than most people\u2019s in India,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I was born to two educated parents in an upper-caste family in a major city.\u201d When Chopra was 17, a woman was fatally gang-raped on a bus in Delhi, a crime that shocked India and the world. Chopra, who was discovering a love for computer science at the time and idolized Steve Jobs, set to work. He built a wristwatch-style \u201canti-molestation device,\u201d which could detect an elevated heart rate and administer a weak electric shock to an attacker, with the intent to allow the victim time to escape. The device grabbed the attention of the media and India\u2019s former President, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who encouraged Chopra to apply for a scholarship at Stanford. (The only thing Chopra knew about Stanford at the time, he recalls, is that Jobs studied there. Later he discovered even that wasn\u2019t true.) Only later did Chopra realize the naivety of trying to solve the problem of endemic sexual violence with a gadget. \u201cTechnologists are very prone to seeing a problem and building to solve it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to critique an 11th grade kid, but it was a very technical solution.\u201d  As he tells it, his arrival in California was a culture shock in more ways than one. On his first night, Chopra says, each student in his dorm explained how they planned to make their first billion dollars. Somebody suggested building \u201cSnapchat for puppies,\u201d he recalls. Everyone there aspired to be a billionaire, he realized, except him. \u201cVery early at Stanford, I felt alone, like I was in the wrong place,\u201d Chopra says. Still, he had come to college as a \u201ctechno-utopian,\u201d he says. That gradually fell away as he learned in class about how IBM had built systems to support Apartheid in South Africa, and other ways technology companies had hurt the world by chasing profit alone. Returning to India after college, Chopra joined Microsoft Research, a subsidiary of the big tech company that gives researchers a long leash to work on difficult social problems. With his colleague Vivek Seshadri, he set out to research whether it would be possible to channel money to rural Indians using digital work. One of Chopra\u2019s first field visits was to a center operated by an AI data company in Mumbai. The room was hot and dirty, he recalls, and full of men hunched over laptops doing image annotation work. When he asked them how much they were earning, they told him they made 30 rupees per hour, or just under $0.40. He didn\u2019t have the heart to tell them the going rate for the data they were annotating was, conservatively, 10 times that amount. \u201cI thought, this cannot be the only way this work can happen,\u201d he says. Chopra and Seshadri worked on the idea for four years at Microsoft Research, doing field studies and building a prototype app. They discovered an \u201coverwhelming enthusiasm\u201d for the work among India\u2019s rural poor, according to a paper they published with four colleagues in 2019. The research confirmed Chopra and Seshadri\u2019s suspicions that the work could be done to to a high standard of accuracy even with no training, from a smartphone rather than a physical office, and without workers needing the ability to speak English \u2013 thus making it possible to reach not just city-dwellers but the poorest of the poor in rural India. In 2021 Chopra and Seshadri, with a grant from Microsoft Research, quit their jobs to spin Karya out as an independent nonprofit, joined by a third cofounder, Safiya Husain. (Microsoft holds no equity in Karya.) Unlike many Silicon Valley rags-to-riches stories, Chopra\u2019s trajectory, in his telling, wasn\u2019t a result of his own hard work. \u201cI got lucky 100 times in a row,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a product of irrational compassion from nonprofits, from schools, from the government\u2014all of these places that are supposed to help everyone, but they don\u2019t. When I have received so much compassion, the least I can do is give back.\u201d Not everybody is eligible to work for Karya. Chopra says that initially he and his team opened the app up to anybody, only to realize the first hundred sign-ups were all men from a dominant-caste community. The experience taught him that \u201cknowledge flows through the channels of power,\u201d Chopra says. To reach the poorest communities\u2014and marginalized castes, genders, and religions\u2014Chopra learned early on that he had to team up with nonprofits with a grassroots presence in rural areas. Those organizations could distribute access codes on Karya\u2019s behalf in line with income and diversity requirements. \u201cThey know for whom that money is nice to have, and for whom it is life-changing,\u201d he says. This process also ensures more diversity in the data that workers end up generating, which can help to minimize AI bias. Chopra defines this approach using a Hindi word\u2014thairaav\u2014a term from Indian classical music which he translates as a mixture between \u201cpause\u201d and \u201cthoughtful impact.\u201d It\u2019s a concept, he says, that is missing not only from the English language, but also from the business philosophies of Silicon Valley tech companies, who often put scale and speed above all else. Thairaav, to him, means that \u201cat every step, you are pausing and thinking: Am I doing the right thing? Is this right for the community I\u2019m trying to serve?\u201d That kind of thoughtfulness \u201cis just missing from a lot of entrepreneurial \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 behavior,\u201d he says. It\u2019s an approach that has led Karya to flatly reject four offers so far from prospective clients to do content moderation that would require workers to view traumatizing material. It\u2019s compelling. But it\u2019s also coming from a guy who says he wants to scale his app to reach 100 million Indians by 2030. Doesn\u2019t Karya\u2019s reliance on grassroots NGOs to onboard every new worker mean it faces a significant bottleneck? Actually, Chopra tells me, the limiting factor to Karya\u2019s expansion isn\u2019t finding new workers. There are millions who will jump at the chance to earn its high wages, and Karya has built a vetted network of more than 200 grassroots NGOs to onboard them. The bottleneck is the amount of available work. \u201cWhat we need is large-scale awareness that most data companies are unethical,\u201d he says, \u201cand that there is an ethical way.\u201d For the app to have the impact Chopra believes it can, he needs to win more clients\u2014to persuade more tech companies, governments, and academic institutions to get their AI training data from Karya.  But it\u2019s often in the pursuit of new clients that even companies that pride themselves on ethics can end up compromising. What\u2019s to stop Karya doing the same? Part of the answer, Chopra says, lies in Karya\u2019s corporate structure. Karya is registered as a nonprofit in the U.S. that controls two entities in India: one nonprofit and one for-profit. The for-profit is legally bound to donate any profits it makes (after reimbursing workers) to the nonprofit, which reinvests them. The convoluted structure, Chopra says, is because Indian law prevents nonprofits from making any more than 20% of their income from the market as opposed to philanthropic donations. Karya does take grant funding\u2014crucially, it covers the salaries of all 24 of its full-time employees\u2014but not enough to have an entirely nonprofit model be possible. The arrangement, Chopra says, has the benefit of removing any incentive for him or his co-founders to compromise on worker salaries or well-being in return for lucrative contracts.  It\u2019s a model that works for the moment, but could collapse if philanthropic funding dries up. \u201cKarya is very young, and they have got a lot of good traction,\u201d says Subhashree Dutta, a managing partner at The/Nudge Institute, an incubator that has supported Karya with a $20,000 grant. \u201cThey have the ability to stay true to their values and still attract capital. But I don\u2019t think they have been significantly exposed to the dilemmas of taking the for-profit or not-for-profit stance.\u201d Over the course of two days with Karya workers in southern Karnataka, the limitations of Karya\u2019s current system begin to come into focus. Each worker says they have completed 1,287 tasks on the app\u2014the maximum, at the point of my visit, of the number of tasks available on the tuberculosis project. It equates to about six hours of work. The money workers can receive (just under $50 after bonuses for accuracy) is a welcome boost but won\u2019t last long. On my trip I don\u2019t meet any workers who have received royalties. Chopra tells me that Karya has only just amassed enough resellable data to be attractive to buyers; it has so far distributed $116,000 in royalties to around 4,000 workers, but the ones I've met are too early into their work to be among them. I put to Chopra that it will still take much more to have a meaningful impact on these villagers\u2019 lives. The tuberculosis project is only the beginning for these workers, he replies. They are lined up to shortly begin work on transcription tasks\u2014part of a push by the Indian government to build AI models in several regional languages including Kannada. That, he says, will allow Karya to give \u201csignificantly more\u201d work to the villagers in Chilukavadi. Still, the workers are a long way from the $1,500 that would mark their graduation from Karya\u2019s system. Eventually, Chopra acknowledges that not a single one of Karya\u2019s 30,000 workers has reached the $1,500 threshold. Yet their enjoyment of the work, and their desire for more, is clear: when Seshadri, now Karya\u2019s chief technology officer, asks the room full of workers whether they would feel capable of a new task flagging inaccuracies in Kannada sentences, they erupt in excited chatter: a unanimous yes. The villagers I speak to in Chilukavadi and Alahalli have only a limited understanding of artificial intelligence. Chopra says this can be a challenge when explaining to workers what they\u2019re doing. The most successful approach his team has found is telling workers they are \u201cteaching the computer to speak Kannada,\u201d he says. Nobody here knows of ChatGPT, but villagers do know that Google Assistant (which they refer to as \u201cOK Google\u201d) works better when you prompt it in English than in their mother tongue. Siddaraju L., a 35-year-old unemployed father of three, says he doesn\u2019t know what AI is, but would feel proud if a computer could speak his language. \u201cThe same respect I have for my parents, I have for my mother tongue.\u201d Just as India was able to leapfrog the rest of the world on 4G because it was unencumbered by existing mobile data infrastructure, the hope is that efforts like the ones Karya is enabling will help Indian-language AI projects learn from the mistakes of English AIs and begin from a far more reliable and unbiased starting point. \u201cUntil not so long ago, a speech-recognition engine for English would not even understand my English,\u201d says Bali, the speech researcher, referring to her accent. \u201cWhat is the point of AI technologies being out there if they do not cater to the users they are targeting?\u201d",

        "title": "Revel's CEO Wants to Solve the Urban EV Charging Challenge",
        "content": "Frank Reig had a problem back in 2019. The CEO of Revel, a New York City-based electric moped-share startup, was trying to expand the concept to other cities, but he was having trouble finding places where he could access enough power to charge his scooters. The real issue, he soon realized, though, was much bigger. In order to phase out gasoline vehicles in America\u2019s dense urban centers, hundreds of fast charging sites, the electric equivalent of gas stations, would be needed. Those sites would draw huge amounts of power, and it wasn\u2019t clear where they would get it. \u201cEveryone's talking about an [electric vehicle] transition where in 10 years every bus, truck, and car is going to be electric,\u201d Reig says. \u201cAnd I can't find power to charge moped batteries.\u201d For the past decade or so, the pitch to ditch gasoline has mostly been directed at America's suburbanites. Sure, public charging infrastructure was far from ubiquitous and often poorly maintained. But that didn\u2019t matter so much if you lived in a house with a driveway or garage. All you had to do is plug in your car at home, and you\u2019d wake up every morning with the equivalent of a full tank of gas. Many people living in cities have no such luxury. They might park their cars in charger-less garages owned by their building, or else keep them on the street wherever they happen to find a spot. It\u2019s a situation that will affect about 10% of the country\u2019s electric vehicles once the U.S. switches over from gas power, according to the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. That\u2019s 29 million cars that will have to find juice somewhere other than a house, which means we\u2019ll need a lot of public fast charging stalls. The problem, though, was that few companies were focused on building them in cities. Then Revel came along. Over the past two years, the one-time scooter company has quietly remade itself into perhaps the most important new player in the urban EV transition. Its blue mopeds are still a common sight in New York City. Since 2021, they\u2019ve been joined by a steadily expanding fleet of electric ride-hail vehicles, mostly Tesla Model 3s and Model Ys, all painted the company\u2019s signature bright blue. But the roving EVs are just the most visible part of Revel\u2019s transformation. Over the past two years, the company has built 40 electric vehicle fast charging stalls in New York City, for use by both Revel\u2019s fleet and the general public. The company is on track to build at least another 90 by the end of this year, and it says it\u2019ll have more than 300 chargers in the city by the end of 2024. That buildout, Reig believes, will give him control of 90% of the city\u2019s universal fast charging market (though that\u2019s not counting Tesla\u2019s more than 80 supercharger stalls in the city, which are increasingly becoming open to vehicles from other automakers). The company is also planning to build 200 fast charging stalls in the San Francisco bay area by the end of next year. Read more: How Electric Cars Could Craft the Soundscape of the Future The effort has garnered enthusiastic support at the highest levels of municipal and federal government. New York City Mayor Eric Adams gave a speech at the opening of Revel\u2019s newest charging hub in the garage of a Williamsburg, Brooklyn, office building in April. The U.S. Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, made an appearance at the June 2021 opening of Revel\u2019s first public charging hub in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, then the largest universal charging hub in the country. \u201cOn behalf of the Biden Administration, and on behalf of [the] 330 million people in America who want to see us lead again in clean energy, thank you to Revel,\u201d Granholm said. Reig\u2019s plan hinged on a bit of clever economics. Between the price of equipment, construction, and urban leases, it can cost millions of dollars to build the fast charging stations that cities need. That creates a chicken-and-egg conundrum: With few EVs on city roads, (about 1% of New York City\u2019s vehicles are electric) there\u2019s little incentive for developers to pour funds into building charging stations, since it would take years for there to be enough demand for them to recoup their investment. And without public fast charging, drivers will continue to have few options to charge their vehicles, keeping the transition from taking off. But there\u2019s also opportunity. There are a few choice spots where preexisting power infrastructure\u2014built to service a shuttered factory, for instance, or for a building whose residents ended up using less electricity than expected\u2014lines up with enough space to charge a stream of power-hungry EVs. Whoever develops those sites will be sitting on a gold mine when residents and cab drivers start switching to EVs en masse. The question, though, was whether you could keep from going bankrupt as you waited for enough drivers to buy EVs and start paying to charge. That\u2019s where Reig\u2019s big idea came in. He wanted to build chargers. But instead of waiting on city residents to switch to electric vehicles and use them, he would generate his own demand by launching a fleet of EV ride-hail vehicles, which would use the electricity he was providing. With money from those app-based rides, he could finance a headlong rush to develop the best urban charging sites before anyone else got to them. \u201cWhoever wakes up two years from now [will find] we've already picked over an entire city,\u201d Reig says. In December 2019, Reig texted his co-founder and COO Paul Suhey, then 28, to pitch him on the idea. Suhey says that it sounded like Reig was preparing for a long sell to win him over. It wasn\u2019t necessary\u2014he was thinking about something similar himself. \u201cThat thumbs up, \u2018let\u2019s do it,\u2019 him bringing that optimism to that situation, literally changed the trajectory of the company,\u201d Reig says. Revel\u2019s electric scooters were still on the streets. But in the minds of the founders, the company was on its way to being something much bigger. The pair had met as colleagues at consultancy GLG in 2016. In 2017, Reig took a trip to Buenos Aires and returned convinced that he could replicate that city\u2019s profusion of motorized scooters to improve transit in New York City. Suhey was planning to go to graduate school to study battery chemistry, but Reig persuaded him to help start the company with him, and the pair set about raising $1 million from friends and relatives to get the business off the ground. Then they went to venture capitalists to get another $4 million. It wasn\u2019t easy, Reig says. \u201cA lot of [potential investors] are going to tell you your idea doesn\u2019t make sense, or it\u2019s not going to scale, or it\u2019s not going to work. Or they\u2019ll just ghost you,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you better have optimism.\u201d Read more: This Company Could Be Crucial to Biden\u2019s EV Charger Agenda The scooter business boomed in the early days of the pandemic, with commuters wary of crowds taking Revel\u2019s mopeds instead of using mass transit. The business \u201cseemed like a goldmine,\u201d says Mike Granoff, one of the company\u2019s early investors. But problems also started showing up. Bills to pay parking tickets for improperly parked scooters and to replace stolen batteries were accumulating. In July 2020, two people died riding Revel scooters, and the company shut down the service. New York City\u2019s then-mayor Bill DiBlasio said that it would need city approval to start up again. Granoff, a veteran in the electrification space, was despondent. \u201cI'm supposed to have been the one telling Frank that you can get through this. I'm older, [and] more experienced,\u201d Granoff says. \u201cIt was the other way around. He reassured me.\u201d With the blessing of the city, Revel restarted the service the next month, now with helmet safety checks and traffic safety tutorials in their app. Reig and Suhey likely picked a good time to start moving beyond mopeds. When the duo founded Revel back in 2018, micro mobility was all the rage. San Francisco-based Bird had reached a jaw dropping valuation of $2 billion, and new startups with names like Blue Duck and Scoobi were trying to get in on the action, bringing zippy electric contraptions to cities from San Antonio to Pittsburg. These days, though, the sector is facing a reality check. Blue Duck, Scoobi, and other small micro mobility startups are no more, while the bigger players like Bird have gone through layoffs and retreated from aggressive expansion plans. Revel, by contrast, is expanding its charging business as fast as it can. Speaking outside a Williamsburg coffee shop, Reig outlines his business strategy in crisp, emphatic phrases. He\u2019s polished and eager, all clean lines, good attitude, and big bold vision, like some kind of theoretical entrepreneur dreamed up by the wonks who wrote the Inflation Reduction Act. \u201cWe realized there is a first-mover advantage for a company like Revel,\u201d Reig says. \u201cNot to talk about 2030 like everyone else, [but] to actually build now, and move now, and execute now.\u201d When it comes to visionary businesspeople promising to change the world, many of us have experienced a few too many unadvertised consequences to be entirely unskeptical. Municipal officials still harbor memories of Uber\u2019s relentless venture capital-fueled expansion in the 2010s, which used grey-area tactics and vast lobbying efforts to fend off local regulation. Revel has sought to distance itself from the Uber model. For one thing, it pays its drivers as employees, rather than bringing them on as contractors. And Reig says the company is focused on working with city governments, not trampling them. Still, some officials have painted Revel with the same brush. The company provoked a backlash from the New York City government when it tried to launch its first 50-car ride-hail service back in April 2021. New York City had enacted a limit on new ride-share licenses, but with an exception for new EVs. But then-Taxi and Limousine (TLC) Commissioner Aloysee Heredia Jarmoszuk excoriated the startup, saying that the exemption was intended to allow existing for-hire companies to switch to EVs, not to permit a new player to enter the market. Revel, she said, had deviated from \u201cthe spirit of [the] rules,\u201d and she promised that the regulator \u201cwill not cut corners in doing its full diligence.\u201d Matt Daus, a former chair of the New York TLC, says that response wasn\u2019t fair. \u201c[Revel] has the right business model. They\u2019re taking care of the drivers, and they\u2019re building infrastructure for everyone to use. What\u2019s not to like about it?\u201d he says. \u201cI was scratching my head.\u201d Reig, for his part, casts the run-in in diplomatic tones. \u201cThat partnership feeling was missing,\u201d he says. In 2022, Eric Adams took over as New York City Mayor, and he appointed a new TLC commissioner, David Do, who previously served as director of Washington, D.C.\u2019s Department of For-Hire Vehicles. (Jarmoszuk had resigned earlier that year, after a video of her berating employees was released to the press.) Do is a big fan of Reig. The city wants all ride-hail vehicles to go electric by 2030, and Do says Revel is critical to making the transition happen. \u201cWe need infrastructure,\u201d Do says. \u201cNo one else\u2026has been putting infrastructure in the ground like Revel has.\u201d Last year, Reig and Suhey raised $126 million from major investors like Blackrock, and they\u2019re plowing the cash into their plan to build out charging infrastructure. The amount of work ahead, though, is enormous. Revel expects New York City will need about 5,000 fast chargers to switch over all cabs, Ubers, and Lyfts to electric, over 10 times more than the company has in the pipeline out to 2024. To decarbonize all of the city\u2019s 2 million vehicles, the city will need even more chargers than that. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take investment partners. It\u2019s going to take city relationships. It\u2019s going to take potentially regulatory changes. It\u2019s going to take the utility continuing to step up,\u201d Reig says. \u201cOr else it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d At the same time, though, Reig and Suhey are already thinking through a new company transformation: from power user to power provider. Revel is on track to become a major player on the grid, with hundreds of charging stations and thousands of EV batteries. But if it plans ahead as it builds, the stations won\u2019t just be set up to draw power\u2014they can also put it back. It\u2019s a new way to make money if electricity prices spike. There could also come a day when Reig could pull vehicles off the road to prevent a summer blackout. Talking through the possibilities, his excitement is palpable. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just raring to go.\u201d",

        "content": "In 2019, we decided to host anti-racism events in white women\u2019s dining rooms for one specific reason: To turn the age-old adage, \u201cit\u2019s rude to talk about politics at the dinner table\u201d on its head. This is what we\u2019ve learned\u2014if you don\u2019t talk about racism, you can\u2019t dismantle it. But it isn\u2019t just over the dinner table that this \u201cniceness\u201d rules. In the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020, you were eager, frenzied even, to do this work. A mere two years later, not only is that excitement for anti-racism work gone, the pendulum has swung in the other direction, into a verifiable whitelash against anti-racism work. If white womanhood is a house, your need to be perfect is the foundation. It is this need for perfection that makes it impossible to engage in antiracism work. Being perfect is the key to your happiness, to your success, to your very existence. Perfect hair. Perfect clothes. Perfect grades. Perfect nails. Perfect weddings. Perfect bodies. Perfect adoring and supportive wife and mother. Perfect employee and colleague. White skin. The foundational principle of perfection in a white supremacist society like ours is rooted in whiteness. Without it, your A\u2019s will never be straight enough, your MVP trophies not shiny enough, your flowery dresses a bit wilted. Of course, white skin alone doesn\u2019t render you perfect, but without it, you have no chance. White skin is a necessary (yet still insufficient) ingredient of perfection. The con, of course, is there is no actual recipe for perfection, as there is no such thing as perfection. Read More: How the \u2018Karen Meme\u2019 Confronts the Violent History of White Womanhood This makes your endless quest for perfection a trap. You will never be pretty enough. You will never be thin enough. You will never be smart enough or successful enough or rich enough. You will never be enough. Yet white women will die trying. Especially over dinner. We call it the \u201cThree Point Plan for Perfectionism.\u201d It goes like this: You\u2019ve been taught generation after generation that talking about politics over a meal is rude. Being rude is the enemy of perfection. Being perfect is your number one life goal, so you will not talk about racism. White women regularly mention having been \u201cburned\u201d on social media for saying the \u201cwrong thing.\u201d You have been publicly humiliated, often at the hands of a fellow white woman, who is angling to show you how much more perfect she is at antiracism work. Yes, you even compete in the antiracism space. Getting called out makes you want to stop the work, to stop engaging. If you aren\u2019t already perfect at it, then you don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. Yet if you stop the work, you can\u2019t make progress. Then there are those situations in which the critique of you is coming from a woman of color. This will hit you in a deeply uncomfortable place. After all, you are not used to having us challenge you\u2014and on a topic we absolutely know more about: being on the receiving end of racism. This, in particular, infuriates white women. Us publicly calling you out on your racism. Us publicly telling you that you are not perfect. Antiracism work depends on your acknowledging your imperfections, namely how you have been born into and nurtured by a white supremacist society. This means acknowledging that you are not the expert on how it feels to be on the receiving end of racism, which means you do not get to decide what is and is not racist. Just like men don\u2019t get to decide what is and is not sexist. It means acknowledging that you will get it wrong, that you will feel embarrassed, and that you will struggle to make progress. In spite of these obstacles and this necessary discomfort, you will have to pick yourself up and get back into the work\u2014work that is messy, not tidy. Work that is tables turned upside down, not neatly set. Work that is imperfect. So, why show up? Why do this work now? Because you must. You\u2019ll do it because not only is it the right thing to do, but you know that your lives, and your kids\u2019 and your grandkids\u2019 lives, depend on your showing up, even when things get hard. You will show up because you understand that white supremacy hurts you too. You are doing this not to save us, but to free yourselves. So the next time you think things like, \u201cI didn\u2019t pipe up on Facebook because I don\u2019t want to be attacked,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to say the wrong thing,\u201d or \u201cThe last time I called someone out at a dinner party, my husband was grumpy with me for a week,\u201d think about this: The only wrong move is remaining silent, sitting on the sidelines, accepting your role in white supremacy. Don\u2019t do nothing out of the fear of doing it imperfectly. Get in there. Read. Listen. Learn. Speak up. Speak out. Show up. Roll up your sleeves. And when you receive criticism, consider that maybe it\u2019s just that: a critique, and not an attack. Maybe this disagreement isn\u2019t a fight. Maybe you don\u2019t know more than the Black, Indigenous, or brown woman attempting to set you straight. And isn\u2019t freedom from white supremacy worth some level of conflict? Isn\u2019t it more important to eradicate racism than to be liked by everybody? You\u2019ve never been liked by everybody in the first place! In the end, you cannot even start the process of extracting white supremacy until you extract the need to be perfect. The need to be perfect is not just harmful to us, it\u2019s harmful to you. Aren\u2019t you tired of never being enough?

That's according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the E.U.-funded Copernicus Climate Change Service. Already, the first three weeks of this month have been the warmest three-week stretch globally on record. Comparing that stretch of time to previous years, experts believe this July is on track to beat previous records. And the world has already been experiencing the impact of this climate-changed world\u2014from heat waves in Europe, the U.S., and Asia, to wildfires in Canada and Greece, and hot tub-esque seawater around Miami. \u201cThe extreme weather which has affected many millions of people in July is unfortunately the harsh reality of climate change and a foretaste of the future,\u201d said Petteri Taalas, the World Meteorological Organization\u2019s Secretary-General, in a statement. \u201cThe need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is more urgent than ever before. Climate action is not a luxury but a must.\u201d To make their determination, scientists at the WMO and Copernicus looked at satellite data for both surface air and sea temperatures. July 6 saw the global average surface air temperature reach a record 17.08\u00b0C (62.74\u00b0F). And for the month so far, average global air temperatures have reached 16.95\u00b0C (62.51\u00b0F). That's well above the average 16.63\u00b0C (61.93\u00b0F) temperatures experienced in July 2019 which, until this month is over, will technically hold the top place as the warmest July, and warmest month, ever recorded.

        "title": "What Happens Without Affirmative Action? Ask the Infamous 96",
        "content": "In 2006, Corey Matthews was the first person in his family to go to college. The application and selection process was so foreign to him that community programs that illuminated his options and helped him apply to several schools were a godsend. But when he had to decide where to actually enroll, Matthews merged what he had been taught with a criteria straight out of the movies. \u201cI grew up in L.A. so I associate UCLA with sports, which I didn\u2019t really have an interest in, but I did have an interest in big parties,\u201d says Matthews, now 34 and a vice president of global philanthropy with JP Morgan Chase. Today, he helps to manage a grant portfolio in Los Angeles consistent with the company\u2019s goals, the kind of multifactor strategy work that makes him chuckle about his 17-year-old logic and sigh when he thinks about just how significant that decision and, in many ways, his freshman class became. What Matthew found on campus was something far different than a series of ragers interrupted by classes and coursework. In 2006, 10 years after California voters first banned race consideration in college admissions with Proposition 209, just 96 Black freshmen were admitted to UCLA, one of the state\u2019s two flagship public universities. After a few more students were admitted during the appeals process, Matthews ultimately became one of just 100 Black freshmen out of 4,852 total. But the initial news of 96 Black students \u2013 a figure unseen at one of California\u2019s most prestigious public universities since the early 1970s \u2013 situated a respected institution in one of America\u2019s most diverse cities and a state often understood as a caricature land controlled by progressive policy and people as the place to watch for those on both sides of the affirmative-action debate. California had become the first state in the nation to ban affirmative action in admissions, to lean into a particular conception of American fairness and absolute meritocracy that those opposed to affirmative action say exists. Of course California has long been more complicated than those who consider the Golden State a byword for progressive excesses and accommodations. Its voters, after all, have sent Ronald Reagan, Dianne Feinstein, Maxine Waters, and Kevin McCarthy to Washington. Nearly 55% approved Proposition 209. And it has long been a kind of laboratory where new and sometimes long-sought-after policies get implemented and their effects often become clear. When California eliminated affirmative action in college admissions, Black and Latino student enrollment in the University of California system declined, with the sharpest drops happening at the state\u2019s flagship universities. A fraught, sometimes taxing on-campus atmosphere developed for the small number of Black and Latino students who did enroll, but it also breathed new life into a rich tradition of student activism. The change pulled students, alumni, and some faculty into a range of efforts to recruit, admit, and retain a larger number of Black and Latino students, producing notable but modest effects which, after the nadir of Black student enrollment became the subject of national headlines in 2006, slowly pushed back against the creep of Proposition 209-inspired thinking and practices at the states\u2019 public colleges and universities. But by 2016, two decades after California voters approved Proposition 209 and a decade after the push to counter its effects gained force, something else was also clear. Student enrollment in the University of California system, one of the most well-regarded in the nation (it includes seven schools considered so-called public Ivies) still didn\u2019t look much like the people who live in the state. Black, Latino, Native American, and Pacific Islander students made up about 56% of the state\u2019s high school graduates but just 37% of those enrolled in California\u2019s public colleges and universities, University of California data indicates. Read More: What Killing Affirmative Action Means for the American Workplace In the years since Proposition 209, at least 10 other states have gone the way of California, banning affirmative action in college admissions with two reversing course after courts struck down those policies. But now that the Supreme Court has ruled that race-conscious affirmative action in college admissions at both private and public universities is unconstitutional, the whole country will join them. And for a large segment of the population, that\u2019s just fine \u2013 according to a recent Pew Research Center poll, only 33% approve of selective colleges considering race and ethnicity in admissions decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting, the national discourse around affirmative action at the time,\u201d Matthews says about his experiences at UCLA beginning in 2006, \u201cit felt very clear. If you believed in social justice and understood equity and race \u2014 and we weren\u2019t even using terms like equity \u2013 you would be OK with affirmative action, almost immediately. But affirmative action has evolved to something completely different. People will say, \u2018Yeah, I believe in equity, but is affirmative action the way? Oh, I don\u2019t support that.\u2019\u201d The lessons of what happened in California are important to understand. Back in 2006, it didn\u2019t take long for Matthews to realize that what he\u2019d hoped would be a fun school right there in his big-city hometown was also a swirling vortex of controversy. \u201cThere was just a lot of outcry around how there were not even 100 Black students out of an entering class of 4,000. Then you peel that back a little bit further and there were even fewer Black men, young Black men coming into the university.\u201d What that ultimately set in motion for Matthews is something he\u2019s still unpacking today. \u201cUCLA is not bashful about its student activism, taking very public stances on certain issues, having students agitate on certain issues,\u201d says Matthews. \u201cBecause of that\u2026when I got there, I always say the campus sort of descended upon me.\u201d It\u2019s hard for him to remember now, but he thinks it was at events set up by the UCLA Afrikan Student Union for the incoming freshmen class in April of his senior year in high school that he learned how Black student enrollment, what people were already calling \u201cthe Infamous 96,\u201d compared to previous years. A few months later, Matthews was on campus, a freshman, navigating his first steps into adulthood. On the first day of class, he was approached by a Black upperclassman with one of those \u201care you with us?\u201d kind of conundrums. \u201c[He] came up to me and said, \u2018Come with me and go to this protest,\u2019\u201d Matthews says. Matthews felt torn. He knew he needed to go to class but also that the work of trying to raise questions and find solutions to the dearth of diversity on campus was very important. He went to the protest, then to his later classes. But the people he connected with at that protest, the work he did with them, the work he did helping to recruit Black applicants in Los Angeles, and the work he did as the eventual Afrikan Student Union chairperson in coalition with Asian and Latino student groups familiarized him with a concept that is much talked about in college-admissions circles today.

It requires or calls on schools to consider more than a student\u2019s grades and ACT and SAT scores. Research has shown that these standardized tests do not accurately predict college performance but closely reflect the education and wealth of a student\u2019s parents and a student\u2019s access to test-prep tools. And an admissions system that depends on them alone disadvantages Black and Latino students, those who come from poor families, and those who are among the first in their families to go to college or trying to navigate the higher-ed system without some kind of experience or guide. Holistic admissions require a school to consider academic performance but also who a student is, what they have tried to learn or do inside and outside of school, what they have had to manage or opted to take on, the context in which they grew up, what interests and hobbies they have developed, how they have contributed to their communities and what all of this together suggests about a student\u2019s potential to contribute to campus life and to the communities where they live after graduation. The concept came up during oral arguments at the Supreme Court last year, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson probing why, if a university is evaluating an applicant holistically, race should not be considered while other factors, such as a family\u2019s history with the school, could. \u201cThat seems to me to have the potential of causing more of an equal protection problem than it\u2019s actually solving,\u201d she said. Holistic admissions acknowledge that there are multiple types of promise, intelligence, and ability, says Mandela Kayise, who in 2006 was the president of UCLA\u2019s Black alumni association. He had arrived on campus as an undergraduate student in the late 1970s only to be forced out by economic challenges, returned in the 1980s to finish his degree, and joined the administration working in student advising and retention. Kayise also served as a faculty advisor to student groups when Prop 209 passed in 1996 and was doing similar work 10 years later when the Infamous 96 arrived. There were protests against Proposition 209 before and after it passed, he says. But it was when the Infamous 96 got there, human proof of exactly what the ban\u2019s opponents had warned would happen, more of the campus, people connected to it, and Los Angeles civil rights organizations got involved. \u201cIt became \u2018enough is enough,\u2019\u201d says Kayise, who is now the president and CEO of New World Education, a college-access, student-retention and leadership-development organization. For the Infamous 96, and some alumni, holistic admissions became a major focus of student activism and ultimately, a practice UCLA implemented in 2007 and the entire University of California system would follow in 2020. In 2006, Peter Taylor, a Black UCLA alumni, became chair of the university\u2019s task force on African American student recruitment, retention, and graduation. It included students, administrators, faculty, staff, and members of the municipal community. \u201cOne of the things we looked at was why UCLA\u2019s African American [student] population had been shrinking,\u201d says Taylor, a now retired investment banker who has also served as president of the UCLA board of directors, chair of the UCLA foundation board, and spent five years as the University of California system\u2019s chief financial officer. At the time, the system consisted of 10 campuses and five medical centers with a $24 billion budget. \u201cProp. 209 was a big part of it, but part of it was that the admissions system needed to be transformed, a chance for students to make a holistic case for themselves. And we also raised a lot of money for African American students.\u201d Black student enrollment slowly began to grow again. Taylor knows that some people will say, \u201cOh, well, you were just giving them such great scholarships that of course they decided on UCLA,\u201d or presume that race-based scholarships violate the law. But while the University of California could not operate a race-based scholarship, community foundations could and did. And, in most cases, the community-foundation scholarships amounted to a letter to Black students who had been admitted saying, \u201cCongratulations and here is $1,000 to use toward your college costs.\u201d It wasn\u2019t much compared to the cost of college, but $1,000 can make a difference for very low-income students who often face transportation challenges, relatively small costs that they simply can\u2019t cover for a textbook, or issues balancing work hours and school. Plus, the letters included the names of established professionals who were Black alumni. Read More: The Ambitions of the Civil Rights Movement Went Far Beyond Affirmative Action The school\u2019s admissions officers also fanned out and engaged in more on-the-ground, in-person recruiting activity. Under the old way of operating, simple, relatively low-cost, human-to-human niceties like this didn\u2019t happen often, Taylor says. Still, by 2020, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, had found that the end of affirmative action in public college admissions had not only reduced overall Black and Latino student enrollment at California\u2019s public universities but also done damage to these students\u2019 college-graduation rates and wages earned after the college years. What\u2019s more, the 2020 study, released by Berkeley\u2019s Center for Studies in Higher Education, found that claims that affirmative action in college admissions had harmed white and Asian students did not bear out when researchers examined enrollment, graduation rates, and earnings before and after Proposition 209. Instead, the ban on affirmative action in college admissions had contributed to a sort of two-tier higher-education system where the state\u2019s flagship schools \u2013 UCLA and Berkeley \u2013 are attended overwhelmingly by white and Asian students while the other schools in the system, many of which had low Black and Latino student enrollment before the change, saw some gains. Proposition 209 also deterred thousands of qualified students from these same groups from applying to any campus. Because fewer students of color enrolled in UC schools overall after Proposition 209 and the number enrolled in STEM programs, particularly among Latino students, also fell, the number of early-career Black, Latino, Native American, and Pacific Islander graduates earning over $100,000 dropped by at least 3%. The study provided the \u201cfirst causal evidence that banning affirmative action exacerbates socioeconomic inequities.\u201d That year the system\u2019s board of regents voted unanimously to support a repeal of Proposition 209. They also agreed to phase out requirements that applicants submit SAT and ACT scores, then by 2025 develop the system\u2019s own standardized test. The state\u2019s lawmakers put the question of repealing Proposition 209 on the November 2020 ballot. But California voters defeated it \u2013 with 57% voting to keep the ban on affirmative action in college admissions in place. Beyond the enrollment figures and the graduation rates, there are the experiences of being a Black human being on a campus like UCLA\u2019s. And to this day Kayise wonders if the Infamous 96 were a class asked to take on too much. \u201cThey were so small,\u201d he says. \u201cThey not only had to figure out how to thrive themselves in an environment where there were fewer of them to provide support to one another but they picked up the job of trying to help the next generation of high school students gain access and rebuild some of the programs and community-service projects, the [Black] fraternities and sororities that were suffering.\u201d In essence, as Black student enrollment slid to that low in 2006, some of the organizations, events, programs, and infrastructure that previous groups of Black students could rely upon for social, emotional, and academic support had shriveled or died. The Infamous 96 had to rebuild them and use them at the same time. \u201cGoing to college is hard, it\u2019s hard enough,\u201d says Rachel Aladdin, another member of the Infamous 96. Like Matthews, she was a first-generation college student. She grew up in Pasadena, about 30 miles and an entire world northeast of UCLA\u2019s campus outside Los Angeles. Aladdin and her identical twin sister, Rebekah, were raised by a single father, who was living with multiple sclerosis. So as they applied to college, they considered practical things, like the ease with which they could get back to Pasadena on the weekends. Rebekah received an admissions letter from UCLA first. Rachel doesn\u2019t think hers ever came, but she found out that she too had been admitted five stressful days later when a high school history teacher let her log into an admissions website in his classroom. Rachel Aladdin was awarded a four-year scholarship from the Jackie Robinson Foundation, and by that summer she was on campus for the freshman summer program, an academic enrichment and social-adjustment program for students coming from underserved communities. Between that and freshman orientation, she thinks she met all of the Infamous 96. There were a number of athletes among them including the NBA player Russell Westbrook. The 96, and for that matter the limited number of Black students on campus, were generally close, and from this Aladdin drew a big circle of friends. It was, perhaps, the one upside of such a small group of Black freshmen. She grew up in a family where race was talked about, and while her hometown was diverse, there\u2019s a fair bit of effective segregation, she says. So, being one of just 96 Black students admitted was upsetting but not surprising. What was hard was the day to day on campus once classes began. Read More: The Supreme Court\u2019s Decision on Affirmative Action Must Not Be the Final Word \u201cWhen you have the troubles of life on top of that, as a Black person from an underserved community,\u201d Aladdin says, \u201cand you now have this racial climate that you have been thrown into. It was crazy. I don\u2019t know if some of my experience was projection because it was so top of mind. There are 96 Black freshmen here. And you felt alienated. You felt very different.\u201d When Matthews arrived on campus, he was, as he puts it, all of 5 ft. 3 in. Yet, non-Black people all over campus frequently asked him questions or mentioned things to him that seemed to hinge on the presumption that he was an athlete. \u201cI\u2019ve since had a little growth spurt so I am now 5 ft. 7 in.,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what I could not believe is that people, at this Division I school, seriously looked at me and made their assumptions. This was before we had or at least I knew of terms like microaggressions, pre-DEI and all of that.\u201d It often made Matthews, other members of the 96, and other Black students on campus feel as if they weren\u2019t welcome. \u201cWe really started talking about campus climate and safety and feeling psychologically safe and feeling that, \u2018Do I belong here?\u2019 thing,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cThis was about like look, I\u2019m on campus. I stick out like a sore thumb. I stay in my little small enclave and I go to class and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Matthews didn\u2019t feel welcome so he didn\u2019t engage in many parts of campus life. He got in. He did what he could to make way for others. He went to class. He learned. He graduated. He got out. He\u2019s accepted that not everyone actually grasps the difference between equality and actual equity, that people are sometimes rude intentionally and sometimes don\u2019t know exactly how offensive they are. Sometimes they simply do not care. For Aladdin, the climate on campus made her question everything. When someone would fail to move over to share the sidewalk, forcing her into the grass, she often wasn\u2019t sure if they were just rude or they were racist. When someone failed to hold a building door despite her trailing only inches behind, when people didn\u2019t thank her for holding the door for them or making room for them on a bench, she wasn\u2019t sure. Read More: How the End of Affirmative Action Could Affect the College Admissions Process \u201cYou often found yourself asking, how racist is this, really?\u201d Aladdin says. \u201cI think with time those thoughts subsided, but at first\u2026I made sure I was aware of my surroundings because I didn\u2019t know how weird things could get.\u201d When she walked across campus or anywhere near the row of white fraternity houses, she felt particularly anxious about her safety. It wasn\u2019t that she thought white frat guys were particularly dangerous. It was that she wasn\u2019t sure anyone would care or respond if she became the victim of a crime and she worried about hate crime specifically. In class she was often the only Black person in the room and felt the need to represent Black people well. But unlike her classmates, most of whom had laptops and in some cases, multiple devices, she and her sister were sharing a desktop. She majored in world arts and cultures and found other students in the department, many of them wealthy and most of them white, a bit standoffish. Aladdin, who since graduation has worked as an actress, model, songwriter, and screenwriter, has an ad-sales job at Disney and a BET Christmas movie on her resume, Merry Switchmas, featuring both her and her twin. But when she was a freshman, she had to deal with all of that on top of all the other changes that come with anyone\u2019s adjustment to college. \u201cThe emotional gymnastics of having to analyze it,\u201d says Aladdin, who went home every weekend until her father died her senior year. \u201cYou have this dynamic that felt so uncomfortable, but then you also felt this responsibility to do something about it.\u201d In the fall of 2021, UCLA championed the demographics of its new student body. It had required a lot of effort and spending on targeted recruitment and other activities that began after the year that brought in the Infamous 96. It still wasn\u2019t much like the state\u2019s population but had restored and surpassed the level of campus diversity in 1995 the year before Proposition 209 passed. In 1995 there were 790 Latino students on campus. In 2021 there were 1,185, according to the school\u2019s data. There were 259 Black students enrolled at UCLA in 1995 and in 2021, 346. (Federal data puts percentages for Black and Latino students that year slightly lower than UCLA\u2019s figures.) But even the University of California system itself argued last year that the loss of affirmative action had had a profound impact, writing in a brief to the Supreme Court that \u201c[f]or nearly a quarter century, UC has made persistent, intensive efforts to improve the diversity of its student body through race-neutral programs, yet full realization of the educational benefits of diversity remains elusive.\u201d A public university system exists to educate, to prepare, to enable the intellectual and economic growth of a state, its people and the country around them. It exists to foster the development of leaders and innovations and meet social and economic needs. So, Taylor has also grown concerned about other after-effects of Proposition 209 and some phenomena which predate it but have grown more intense. Away from the California flagships, Black and Latino student enrollment has slowly climbed on campuses where these students were once scarce. He worries that public resources aren\u2019t keeping pace. That\u2019s true in other parts of the U.S. as well, where most students, and certainly the vast majority of students of color, attend open or nearly open enrollment schools as opposed to the elite institutions at the center of the affirmative-action debate. There, public funding cuts have shifted more costs onto students, including many low-income students. UCLA, like every campus, always had people occupying every place on the continuum from anti-racist to open bigot, Kayise says. It always had people who hated affirmative action and took every chance they could get to \u201caccuse\u201d Black students of \u201ctaking\u201d someone else\u2019s slot. Both Matthews and Aladdin had a version of that very exchange, a decade after the affirmative-action ban. Kayise recalls a professor who kept a cartoon affixed to his office door that read \u201cAffirmative Action lets them in. I kick them out.\u201d So Kayise has a warning to a country that just followed California and banned race-based affirmative action: Watch the campus climate, the way all students are treated. \u201cPeople need to be prepared,\u201d Kayise says, \u201cfor the kind of attitudinal change that you might find. People who maybe feel like Black people don\u2019t belong on those campuses may now feel emboldened. They may no longer feel an obligation to lift a finger to facilitate any form of diversity, no need to diversify the staff, try to bring new voices onto the faculty. Like, you are free now to say what you feel.\u201d",

        "title": "Climate Change is Changing How We Dream",
        "content": "Martha Crawford started having climate change dreams about 11 or 12 years ago. Unlike many of her previously remembered dreams, these were not fragmented or nonsensical\u2014they were \u201cvery explicit,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThey didn\u2019t require a lot of interpretation.\u201d In one, she\u2019s reading a textbook about climate change and then throws it behind the back of her couch, pretending it doesn\u2019t exist. In another, she\u2019s sitting in a lecture given by a climate scientist. But the professor starts yelling at her for not paying attention, and she fails the course. The meaning was pretty clear, says Crawford, a licensed clinical social worker: \u201cYou\u2019re not paying attention, and you need to pay attention.\u201d The dreams eventually inspired her to start the Climate Dreams Project in 2019, and since, she\u2019s been facilitating a space where people can share climate dream anecdotes, mostly anonymously. One dream submitted to the collection was of people digging holes in the desert so that the rising seas would have somewhere to go. In another contribution, a Flood Football game was underway, and in the second half, players were floating on inner-tubes. Another person, who shared four climate dreams, recounted one in which billions of people were funneling into a giant room that looked like a video-game sports arena, but large enough to hold the world\u2019s population. \u201cAt the end of the dream, the entire face of the earth was different,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt was completely icy and the only habitable part was a giant plateau with a city on it.\u201d It would seem that climate change has woven itself into the \u201cfabric of dreaming\u201d as Crawford puts it. Studying dreams can be slippery. We don\u2019t always remember them, and interpreting them is highly subjective. But, according to a survey of 1,009 people conducted by The Harris Poll in June on behalf of TIME, over a third of people in the U.S. have dreamed about climate change at least once in their lives. The imagery and sensations evoked by these dreams vary widely, according to the survey. Most people\u2019s climate dreams involve extreme weather or natural disasters; fewer are about mosquitoes and locusts or political leaders and laws. The most common emotions reported are fear and stress, except among Millennials who seem to have more hopeful dreams. The prevalence of climate dreams decreases with age: 56% of people between 18 and 34 years old said they had at least one climate dream in their life compared to 14% of people over the age of 55. Men appear to be dreaming more about climate change than women. And people of color are dreaming about it far more than white people. Together, the data give us a new perspective on how the country may be feeling about climate change. Every now and then, society collectively experiences the same moment to such an acute degree that it changes our dreams. The pandemic certainly did this, as have world wars and 9/11. The question is whether enough people are feeling climate change acutely enough that it is systemically infiltrating our dreams at a population-level. The Harris Poll survey, coupled with Crawford\u2019s dream project, suggests that in the U.S., it may be starting to. Climate change is now part of the zeitgeist, says Alan Eiser, a psychologist and a clinical lecturer at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. \u201cIt\u2019s part of what we\u2019re living in and through, so it must impact dreams.\u201d But determining exactly how, he continues, \u201cwell, that\u2019s complicated.\u201d The majority (57%) of Gen Z and Millennials have dreamed about climate change, according to the survey. That\u2019s compared to 35% of Gen Xers and just 14% of Boomers. One way this split can be interpreted is that, from school lessons to real world events, climate change has been pervasive throughout younger people\u2019s lives in a way it hasn\u2019t been for older generations\u2014and it will continue to define their future.  For many people, particularly Gen Zers and Boomers, climate change makes for bad dreams: 44% of Gen Z respondents said their dreams evoked negative emotions (rather than positive or neutral); 41% of Boomers said the same. That\u2019s compared to 24% of Millennials, and 34% of Gen Xers. For both of those generations, positive emotions were far more common; 41% of Gen X respondents, for example, had good climate dreams compared to 35% of Gen Zers and 20% of Boomers. But no one is having more positive climate dreams than Millennials. In this group, 54% of respondents indicated their dreams had positive emotions. Intriguingly, over a third of Millennials said their dreams involved science\u2014at a rate at least 10 percentage points higher than other generations. Climate dreams may actually help people feel motivated to protect the world around them, adds Crawford. \u201cOur dreams often show us that we're embedded in an ongoing relationship with our habitat. Now, many of these dreams can strengthen people and help them find hope.\u201d In one dream submitted to Crawford\u2019s collection, for example, the entrant recounts being asked to give a speech on behalf of a climate scientist: \u201cThe auditorium is filled with pictures of different mushrooms and these are important to the scientist\u2019s work. I am asking the audience to reflect on their sense of belonging in the natural world, and their level of grief. There is a theory underlying the lecture about how these two experiences entwine, but it is overall very positive\u2014there is a sense of active hope pulsing through the words and the crowd.\u201d Other demographic factors such as sex, race, political affiliation, and where you live, also had some influence on whether and how someone dreams about climate change\u2014to a degree. Unsurprisingly, living in the Western United States\u2014where drought, heat, and wildfires are all worsening due to rising global temperatures\u2014can affect someone\u2019s climate dreams. There, 44% of respondents said they\u2019d had a climate dream compared to a third of people across the South, Northeast, and Midwest. And half of people out west\u2014and the same number in the Midwest\u2014had dreams filled with extreme weather compared to 37% in the South and 46% in the Northeast.  Catastrophes like tornadoes or tsunamis are a common theme in all dreams, not just climate-related ones. \u201cOur emotional lives often present like weather,\u201d says Crawford; we use phrases like \u201cI\u2019m flooded,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m heated.\u201d So it\u2019s common for that symbolism to crop up when we\u2019re sleeping. But now, such imagery is more often literally about climate change. \u201cI am visiting a friend who has been ill with covid. Despite her long recovery she still has multiple loaves of fresh baked zucchini bread for her guests,\u201d recounts one contributor to Crawford\u2019s dream project. \u201cWe wander out to see the zucchini growing and her garden is exquisite and abundant, with flowering bushes towering over my head. We collect flowers for wreaths, everyone is wearing flowers. I begin to wonder how they have the water to maintain this garden. I think I have not seen flowers in such abundance that we can wear them in ages, and I compare it to my own parched land. I am not sure if I should be happy for my friend\u2014this generous, giving person\u2014that she has water, or angry that she is using so much when I cannot.\u201d Be it drought or heat waves, hurricanes or flooding, people of color are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. And that awareness seems to be reflected in the survey results. Half of all people of color who were surveyed said they had dreamed about climate change at least once in their lives, compared to just 28% of white people. Meanwhile, people who self-identified as Conservatives dreamed far less (24%) than those who said they were Liberal (48%). And of those who did have climate dreams, positive dreams were far more likely among Conservatives (60%) than Liberals (45%). This seems to reflect the current national divide when it comes to views on how urgent of a threat climate change is. According to an April survey by Pew, significantly more Democrats, or Democrat-leaning, individuals (78%) view climate change as a major threat to the country\u2019s well-being compared to just a quarter of Republicans. The Harris Poll survey also showed that 43% of men had dreamed about climate change while just 29% of women had. More men (50%) had positive dreams compared to women (34%). And regardless of whether the dreams were positive or negative, more women (39%) reported dreams about family than men (29%). That resonates with Rebecca Weston, co-president of the Climate Psychology Alliance North America. As a licensed clinical social worker, Weston often listens to people\u2019s dreams. Dreams are a \u201ckind of a repository and a filter of the feelings and thoughts and images that we're still trying to process in our life,\u201d she says. Personally, she says, \u201cmy dreams are often that I cannot save my children,\u201d from a looming threat created by some sort of extreme weather event. \u201cIt taps into my sense of futility and helplessness in the face of something so large. And it\u2019s much more often about my feeling of helplessness, and I visualize less what happens to my kids.\u201d Studying dreams helps people better understand how the world affects them emotionally. This is particularly true for things outside of an individual\u2019s control, like the impacts of climate change. Part of navigating the climate crisis through dreams, says Crawford, is being \u201cable to come to terms with the aspects of living, the world, and our habitable environment that we do not have control over.\u201d There are a few questions Weston says she\u2019d ask to help someone interpret their climate dreams: What is your relationship to the land, and the place that\u2019s being affected in the dream? What feelings of home does it stir up? Or what about feelings of loss or connection? Who else is in the dream, and what is your relationship to them? What type of relationship is it, one of power, stability, or perhaps insecurity? \u201cI would ask about those things and then talk to them about how that manifests in their world, in their lives,\u201d she explains. Maybe it\u2019s part of your subconscious self \u201csaying this is what we need to develop in your waking life, more connection, more access to nature \u2026 connection to other people who are engaging in these issues.\u201d There could be lessons beyond the individual too. Maybe dreams can teach us something about how to deal with climate change, says Tore Nielsen, director of the Dreams and Nightmares Laboratory and psychiatry professor at the University of Montreal. Dreams have, after all, inspired innovations ranging from the sewing machine to the Periodic Table. When it comes to climate change, maybe logical thinking hasn\u2019t been working so well, says Nielsen. Maybe \u201cwe need more approaches, like a dream-oriented approach.\u201d \u201cImagine you send out a call for dreamers to dream up solutions to climate change. You\u2019d get probably 10s of 1,000s if not hundreds of 1,000s of replies. A lot of them, obviously [won\u2019t be] very useful,\u201d he suggests. \u201cHow many good ideas would it take?\u201d A dream shared in Crawford\u2019s collection offers one vision of the future. \u201cI was part of a group of nomads consisting of about 20 people,\u201d the person begins. \u201cWe would camp in one place for a while then leave before the stormy season.\u201d To survive they planted many, many crops to ensure enough food survived the harsh weather. \u201cWe traveled light, living in teepees mainly. Some of them were insulated and had air conditioning units. We had solar panels for electricity, but mostly used it for lighting and communications. We used large trucks for long-distance journeys and horses for local travel. The most valuable skills were agriculture, mechanics, and electronics. There was no money, and no taxes. Life was simple but we were free.\u201d",

        "content": "If you\u2019re like an unlucky 5% of American adults, you\u2019ll visit a doctor with a medical complaint this year, only to be misdiagnosed and, often, misprescribed a treatment. If you\u2019re like a far less lucky one of 100,000 hospitalized Americans, such a misdiagnosis will cost you your life. There are a lot of reasons for medical errors: inexperienced caregivers; ambiguous symptoms; understaffed hospitals, underlying conditions.  But according to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), there\u2019s one more little-considered cause: doctors working alone\u2014often with too little opportunity to think and rethink the case. By increasing the number of physicians weighing in on a case, doctors can significantly increase the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis and a favorable result, according to a team of researchers led by Damon Centola, professor and director of the Network Dynamics Group at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication.. \u201cWe are increasingly recognizing that clinical decision-making should be viewed as a team effort that includes multiple clinicians and the patient as well,\u201d said co-author Dr. Elaine Khoong, of the University of California, San Francisco, and the San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, in a statement accompanying the release of the study. Medical collaboration is hardly a new thing. As Centola points out, many hospitals, especially ones in lower-income areas, rely on \u201ce-consult technologies,\u201d in which a clinician sends a message to an outside specialist for a second opinion on a case, with results usually taking 24 to 72 hours to come back. But two minds, Centola and his collaborators theorized, are less effective than a hive mind\u2014and they set out to prove that idea. Recruiting a subject group of 2,941 physicians, the authors divided them into a sample group of 2,053 and a control group of 888. All of the subjects were drawn from one of three specialties: internal medicine, emergency medicine, and cardiology. All of them too were presented with case studies of real-life patients who had presented with illnesses known to have high rates of diagnostic error: acute cardiac events, geriatric care, low back pain, and diabetes-related cardiovascular illness prevention. Then they were set to work diagnosing the cases and prescribing a treatment\u2014a process that was divided into three steps, which both groups conducted in different ways. The 888 members of the control group worked alone. They read the case scenario and were given two minutes (sometimes all a doctor gets in an emergency situation) to provide a risk assessment\u2014how serious the patient\u2019s symptoms were, and what the likelihood of severe illness was\u2014and recommend a treatment. This was repeated two more times, with the members of the control group given a second and a third opportunity to re-read and reconsider the case\u2014again with a two-minute timeline, but at least with greater familiarity of the scenario now\u2014and again recommend a treatment. Read More: AI Cough-Monitoring Can Change the Way We Diagnose Disease Things were very different with the other subjects. The 2,053 members of the sample group were divided into smaller groups of 40 each. All of them began the experiment the same way the control group did\u2014taking two minutes to read, diagnose and recommend a treatment for the case study. They too were given a second chance to analyze the case, but before they did, they were also shown the average risk estimate the other 39 doctors in their group\u2014whose identities were not disclosed\u2014had given for the severity of the case. They could then either stick with their initial assessment of the severity of the condition or change it to one more in keeping with the majority. In the third round they did the same, only this time with their treatment recommendation. Both groups benefited from the opportunity to take multiple looks at the same case. In the control group, the doctors improved from an accuracy rate of 76.8% in the first look they took at the case study to 79.3% by the third\u2014or a 3.3% improvement. The sample group, in which the doctors had the benefit of one another\u2019s insights\u2014doubled the improvement of the control group, going from an accuracy of 76.1% to 81.1%, or a 6.6% bump. (There was no indication in the results of the hive mind in the 2,053-person sample leading the doctors to a collective wrong conclusion.) Over a potential U.S. patient population of 332 million, that 6.6% improvement can mean 21.8 million people. \u201cWe can use doctors\u2019 networks to improve their performance,\u201d said Centola in a statement. \u201cThe real discovery here is that we can structure the information-sharing networks among doctors to substantially increase their clinical intelligence.\u201d What\u2019s more, Centola thinks the 40-doctor model his group hit on is a good one. \u201cForty people in a network gets you a steep jump in clinicians\u2019 collective intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe increasing returns above that\u2014going, say, from 40 to 4,000\u2014are minimal.\u201d What\u2019s more, in the sample group, whose members not only read the case study three times, but also read their peers\u2019 responses, the entire trial still took only 20 minutes\u2014far less than the 24 to 72 hours a single-specialist consultation now takes. Effective as the protocol is, there are obstacles to implementing it widely. The amount of time physicians have to spare on cases that are not their own, and reimbursement policies for their work, are both issues to be resolved. More challenging. Centola says, is changing the culture around the business of diagnosing and prescribing\u2014which is too often seen as an entirely solitary practice. \"This network innovation,\" he says, \"replaces that view of decision-making with the insight that it is also a social and behavioral process that can be improved by structuring the flow of information and influence among clinicians.\" When it comes to saving human lives, speed counts, accurate diagnoses count, and getting the right treatment to the right patient counts. If it takes 40 doctors to get all that right, it\u2019s worth the extra work.",

        "title": "Shutdown Threat Intensifies as Congress Leaves",
        "content": "House Republican leaders on Thursday postponed votes for a must-pass government funding bill and dismissed lawmakers to start a six-week recess, raising the risk of a government shutdown in September amid simmering internal conflicts over spending levels and hot-button social issues. The move to punt the bill\u2014which would fund the Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration\u2014sets up a new round of budget fights in September when lawmakers return to Washington with only 12 work days in the House that month. With budget disagreements unresolved despite numerous rounds of amendments and heated discussions in July, lawmakers in the House are expected to leave the Hill on Thursday evening and return on Sept. 12 to a lengthy to-do list that includes passing 11 of the 12 annual appropriations bills. The decision to adjourn with just a single passage vote on the annual spending bills marks a significant setback for GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who had hoped his party would pass as many annual appropriations bills as possible before leaving for recess. But a push by conservatives to pressure GOP leaders to further slash the funding levels for various government agencies and include a provision in the agriculture and FDA bill that would limit access to an abortion pill have upended those plans. \u201cWe should use a government shutdown as a leverage point if necessary,\u201d Rep. Bob Good, a Virginia Republican, said this week. \u201cMost of what we do up here is bad anyway.\u201d House conservatives have pressured Republican leaders to make deeper cuts and attach language to the funding bills on abortion, transgender care, and other social issues that Democrats and some moderate Republicans oppose, including a provision that would nullify a Biden Administration rule allowing the abortion pill mifepristone to be sold in retail pharmacies and by mail with prescriptions from a certified health care provider. Moderate Republicans had voiced their opposition to the abortion provision, warning that they will not support the agriculture and FDA bill unless it is stripped. \u201cI have said from the very beginning that I would not support legislation that would ban abortion nationwide,\u201d Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, said Wednesday. \u201cAnd to me, some of these issues that are being dealt with should be dealt with at the state level, and that\u2019s it. Some states allow it to be mailed, some states don\u2019t. But that should be a decision with the states and the FDA.\u201d Heading into recess, the abortion pill provision remains a main point of contention. McCarthy can only afford to lose a handful of Republicans and still clear the funding bill, but didn't specify when asked by reporters whether he would take out the abortion language: \u201cRegardless of how you feel on this position, you shouldn\u2019t use taxpayer money [for that],\u201d he said at a press conference on Thursday. These were all debates McCarthy had hoped to resolve over the summer. The impasse highlights how little time Republicans have to reconcile their differences before a government shutdown, during which some parts of the government stop working at full capacity as it did in 2013 and twice in 2018. A shutdown, which could come as soon as Sept. 30, would also mean hundreds of thousands of government employees in the affected agencies would go unpaid. House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark criticized Republicans for piling up spending bill votes in September, arguing that lawmakers should stay in Washington to strip out the \"divisive\" measures in the bills and make more progress before recess. \u201cWe have one bill out of 12 completed because extremists are holding your conference hostage,\u201d Clark said on the House floor. \u201cThis is a reckless march to a MAGA shutdown.\u201d",

        "title": "Inside the Los Alamos Lab Making Nuclear Bomb Parts Again",
        "content": "Something unusual is happening inside the plutonium facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. PF-4, as it is known to top government officials, is the heart of America\u2019s nuclear complex, a lab where scientists and engineers study and experiment on highly radioactive materials in tight secrecy. Recently, employees have discovered yellow plastic tents encasing equipment and rendering it inaccessible. At Los Alamos, where even the cleaning crews and firefighters require high-level security clearances, you might think the tents are designed to restrict access to the latest wonder weapon or scientific breakthrough. The truth is more mundane\u2014and more telling. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our expansion plans,\u201d Matthew Johnson, a senior lab manager, tells me during a rare tour of the fortified building. \u201cAll the old stuff is coming out.\u201d PF-4 is being transformed from an experimental laboratory that focuses mostly on research into a facility that mass-produces plutonium \u201cpits,\u201d the grapefruit-sized cores inside every nuclear bomb in America\u2019s arsenal. Los Alamos\u2014 the lab synonymous with the dark art of nuclear-weapon development\u2014hasn\u2019t produced a certified pit in over a decade and has never had to produce more than 10 in a single year. But in 2018, Congress passed a law mandating that PF-4 produce 30 pits a year by 2026. Around $5 billion has already been spent to overhaul the cramped, aging facilities. The Biden Administration has pumped $4.6 billion into Los Alamos this fiscal year alone\u2014a 130% budget increase over what the lab received just five years ago. Truckloads of new work stations, lathes, and furnaces are set for installation. Coast-to-coast recruiting efforts are underway to increase the lab\u2019s workforce, which is already at a record 17,273. Not long ago, such ambitions would have been unthinkable. Following the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991, the U.S. stopped designing, building, and testing new nuclear warheads. Stockpiles were slashed, labs\u2019 budgets cut, and a highly skilled workforce allowed to dwindle. But after a three-decade break from manufacturing nuclear weapons, the U.S. is getting back into the game. Another arms race may be upon us, triggered by China\u2019s growing ambitions and escalating hostilities with Russia, the world\u2019s other nuclear superpower. Since President Biden took office, both nations have wielded their arsenals to threaten adversaries and coerce neighbors. The last remaining nuclear-arms treaty, known as New START, is set to expire in 2026, raising fears about a new era of unchecked expansion. All nine nuclear powers are scrambling to modernize their arsenals and build new weapons. The effort to restart America\u2019s nuclear-weapons manufacturing program in response represents the biggest test since the Manhattan Project. A wide range of arms-control experts and nuclear watchdogs, as well as a handful of lawmakers, are frantically sounding the alarms, warning of the existential risks of the course that leaders in both parties have taken. Critics say the U.S. is repeating the mistakes of the Cold War by funneling billions of taxpayer dollars into weapons that will hopefully never be used and haven\u2019t been tested in more than a generation. They worry about the potential environmental disasters. Washington is reacting to geopolitical concerns without considering the consequences of restarting our own bomb-making factories, says Greg Mello, executive director at the Los Alamos Study Group, an Albuquerque-based watchdog organization. \u201cWe\u2019re rushing into a new arms race with our eyes wide shut,\u201d Mello says, \u201cforgetting everything that went wrong before.\u201d At PF-4, they are well past such debates. Lab managers are busy unsealing and combing through decades-old archives to extract the technical and engineering expertise for plutonium pits that has been all but lost in the U.S. To get a sense of how the headlong rush is unfolding, and the risks that come with it, I accompanied Johnson, a tall, balding metallurgist who\u2019s spent 21 years at the lab, as he led a small group of reporters on a rare trip inside the center of PF-4. It took more than a year to receive government approval for the visit to the facility. All plutonium operations are required to pause if outsiders are on the floor. But with a brief work-stoppage in place, we were given a day pass in late June to slip behind the tiers of barbed-wire fences, code-accessed security doors, and legions of armed guards to catch a glimpse of America\u2019s new nuclear age. Before stepping onto the PF-4 operations floor, we pulled on thick lab coats, cotton shoe-coverings, protective goggles, and personal radiation-detection badges. It\u2019s a windowless, low-slung facility, with a long gray hallway dividing a series of rooms purpose-built for plutonium production. Identity confirmation is required at each door, even though every employee at PF-4 has a Q-level security clearance from the Energy Department, the highest a civilian can hold. Weapons-grade plutonium has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years. The level of radioactivity in these rooms, called \u201chot areas,\u201d is constantly monitored. When you walk into a new chamber, you\u2019re met with the unnerving clicks of a Geiger counter reverberating inside. The personal-safety protocols underline the stakes. One member of our tour had a notebook quarantined after it mistakenly dropped to the floor. Before leaving a room, we had our hands and feet individually checked for contamination. We also were required to take two full body-scans, stepping into different floor-to-ceiling radiation-detection machines, before we left the facility. Inside each production room, workers stand under bright fluorescent lights by a series of linked stainless-steel work stations called gloveboxes. They place their hands into specialized rubber gloves and peer through leaded-glass windows as they shape the plutonium. An accidental slip of the hand could result in catastrophe. There\u2019s virtually no safe level of human exposure to plutonium if it\u2019s inhaled. Even the smallest speck\u2014a one-thousandth of a gram, hidden to the human eye\u2014could kill. \u201cWe have to account for every flake,\u201d Johnson says. The lab has an elaborate air circulation system; the rooms are at a lower pressure than the outside hallways. Each glovebox has a slight vacuum, designed to ensure that if there is a breach, the particles are contained inside the sealed box. The U.S. no longer manufactures new plutonium, so workers at PF-4 take old pits from retired warheads sent from the Pantex plant in the Texas panhandle, which assembles, disassembles, and stores parts for America\u2019s nuclear arsenal. The pits are recycled through a process that purifies them of radioactive elements, which accumulate over time. To do this, plutonium winds its way from glovebox to glovebox through an overhead trolley system snaking through the complex. Dumbwaiters move it up and down from the trolley. The plutonium is melted, machined, welded, and inspected. Mastering these skills can take up to four years of training and mentorship, Johnson says. Each worker must undergo routine mental and physical health checks throughout the year to ensure they can handle weapon components. Up to 1,000 employees work inside PF-4 on a given day, but less than 10 can perform the final step of the assembly, which involves welding pieces of cast plutonium together to form a pit. The task must be done by hand, inside a large walk-in glovebox. Workers wear respirators and several layers of personal protective equipment. The pit then undergoes an inspection process: it\u2019s leak-checked and radiographed, like a medical CT scan, to ensure it meets specifications. If it passes, it\u2019s stamped with a small diamond and sent back to Texas, where it will stay until it\u2019s plugged into a new W87-1 warhead, which is still under development, expected to be completed sometime within the next decade. The W87-1 will be the first 100% newly manufactured nuclear warhead in the U.S. stockpile since the end of the Cold War. Its pit will be encased in plastic explosives designed to detonate with impeccable timing, compressing it, in just a fraction of a second, from the size of a grapefruit into the size of a golf ball. Fission from this first stage of the process spits out neutrons, triggering an atomic chain reaction that generates a massive release of energy\u2014an explosion. The subsequent radiation, pressure, and energy then fuses two types of heavy hydrogen, tritium and deuterium, to form helium. Additional neutrons fire from this process, creating a fission-fusion feedback loop that happens so quickly it appears instantaneous. It culminates with a fireball that reaches into the millions of degrees, followed by a blast that can level buildings for miles around. Read More: Donald Trump is Playing a Dangerous Game of Nuclear Poker. Los Alamos has made 11 development pits so far this year, but none of them are destined for warheads. The first proof-of-concept weaponized pit is slated for completion at the end of 2024, says Robert Webster, Los Alamos\u2019 deputy director for weapons. Webster says he\u2019s confident his team can reach 30 pits per year by 2030. \u201cIt could be sooner,\u201d he says, adding that the most important thing is that it\u2019s done right. \u201cWe\u2019re still cleaning up the legacy mess that we made by working the way we did.\u201d Others are skeptical. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in January that it\u2019s highly unlikely PF-4 will be able to meet its congressional mandate of building 30 pits annually on the prescribed timetable. Another larger facility, the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, which has never produced a single pit, has been tasked with producing 50 per year by 2030. The challenges of building new facilities and re-configuring existing ones with cutting-edge equipment are compounded by the extreme dangers of radioactive plutonium and waste disposal. All this may result in the federal government spending up to $24 billion before Los Alamos and Savannah River can reach their combined target of 80 pits per year, the report says. And rushing has its risks.  The environmental hazards of producing plutonium pits are well-established. The last time the U.S. made pits on a mass scale was in 1989, at the Rocky Flats site in Colorado. Production at the plant, which churned out about 1,000 pits per year, was shut down following a raid by the FBI and Environmental Protection Agency that discovered serious environmental violations. There was enough radioactive waste on the premises to cover a football field to a depth of 20 ft. Some 62 pounds of plutonium were found caked inside the plant\u2019s air ducts. Plutonium poses grave danger to anyone who doesn\u2019t have proper protective equipment, and the total human toll of the work performed at Rocky Flats is unknown. Judy Padilla, 76, worked 22 years at Rocky Flats, most of them handling plutonium in gloveboxes. Padilla says she\u2019s horrified that another generation will be manufacturing pits. She developed a host of medical issues that began during her time at the plant, including a tumor that required a mastectomy of her right breast. Her husband Charles, who also worked at the plant, died in 2014 after battling kidney cancer. Padilla, who attributes both cases to radiation and chemical exposure at Rocky Flats, received $125,000 from the government after Charles died. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, passed at the end of the Clinton Administration, provides funding to former nuclear employees on an individual basis, but Padilla says it\u2019s littered with loopholes that are better designed to deny claimants than help them. \u201cMy advice to younger people doing this work is: Be careful,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought my government would back me up if I got sick and take care of me. That never happened. It sounds really bitter. But yeah, I\u2019m bitter. I consider myself a walking time-bomb.\u201d The safety record of Los Alamos has always been intensely scrutinized, particularly in the post-Cold War years. \u201cIs There Really a Cowboy Culture of Arrogance at Los Alamos?\u201d ran a Dec. 2004 headline in the trade publication Physics Today. The question followed a series of high-profile lapses at the lab, including a trove of missing classified documents and an incident in which an intern suffered an eye injury from a laser. The biggest blunder arguably came in 2011, when technicians took a photograph of eight ingots of plutonium lined up side-by-side on a work table to impress their bosses. It may have looked cool to them, but putting radioactive rods in close proximity risked triggering a chain reaction that could have produced a fatal burst of radiation, capable of killing anyone in the room. Plutonium pit production ended the following year, and hasn\u2019t restarted until now. In 2018, Triad National Security was named as the new contractor to run the lab for the U.S. Energy Department. The company has stated that safety is a core pillar of its operations, including pit production. But workers\u2019 missteps continue to be cited by the the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, which provides independent federal oversight. Jill Hruby, head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Energy Department agency that oversees nuclear weapons, wrote a letter in May to Triad for a formal explanation on four \u201cnuclear safety events\u201d that took place between February and July 2021. The incidents included two separate floods, a glovebox breach, and an instance in which an unsafe amount of fissionable material was placed in a dropbox. An investigation attached to the letter noted a \u201csignificant lack of attention or carelessness\u201d for worker and public safety.  Mistakes like these only heighten skepticism about how Los Alamos can possibly mass-produce plutonium pits on the appointed schedule without risking the health of its workers and surrounding community. Lab officials recognize that the project will generate unprecedented levels of hazardous waste. The most radioactive waste Los Alamos produces, called transuranic waste, primarily involves contaminated gloves, tools, equipment, and other debris that are typically stuffed into 55-gallon drums stored on site until they can be hauled to an underground facility in southeastern New Mexico. The lab projected the number of drums to spike to 2,000 this year, double the tally of just three years ago, according to a 2021 report delivered to Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to comprehend the level of contamination, the diversion of amounts of money into something that, in my view, will not improve national security,\u201d says Jay Coghlan, executive director of Nuclear Watch New Mexico, a Santa Fe-based watchdog. The dangers, of course, stretch far beyond New Mexico. Dread of nuclear annihilation hung over the globe throughout the Cold War. That fear is practically inscribed by history in the creosote-dotted hills around Los Alamos, the birthplace of The Bomb. Located atop a secluded mesa between the Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains, its transformation from a high desert outpost into a boomtown began in 1943, when more than 8,000 scientists, soldiers, and other personnel arrived to work for the Manhattan Project\u2019s secret \u201cSite Y\u201d laboratory, under the direction of the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. The picturesque setting for Oppenheimer\u2019s pursuit of an atomic bomb contributed to the sense of insularity. Outsiders were not welcome. The people who worked and lived at Los Alamos were bound by secrecy and, with few exceptions, unable to leave. To this day, the people on this isolated plateau say they\u2019re \u201con the hill,\u201d which by default means that everyone else in the world is \u201coff\u201d it. But the ingrained seclusion of Los Alamos isn\u2019t just semantic and geographic. It\u2019s hard to find anyone in the community of 13,000 who doesn\u2019t either work at the lab or have a neighbor, friend, or family member who does. It is a company town where even the street names gesture to its controversial past: Oppenheimer Drive, Trinity Drive, Manhattan Loop. The lab developed the first atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed and maimed hundreds of thousands of Japanese in 1945. Those were crude, comparatively simple devices that produced explosive yields measured in kilotons, or thousands of tons of TNT. In the arms race that ensued over the following decades, weapons designers at Los Alamos came up with ever more lightweight and destructive weapons\u2014some so small that they allowed for a dozen city-busting warheads to fit inside a single ballistic missile\u2019s nose cone. Today\u2019s staged-thermonuclear devices produce explosive yields measured in megatons, or millions of tons of TNT\u2014weapons far more lethal than Oppenheimer\u2019s original. When the U.S. began pursuing such bombs, Oppenheimer discouraged it, calling them a \u201cweapon of genocide.\u201d Oppenheimer envisioned the A-bomb program as a one-off for a narrow mission. Instead, nuclear bomb-making became a full-fledged American industry. Los Alamos was just one facet of a nationwide nuclear-industrial complex, cranking out weapons components for an arsenal that the U.S. wielded to deter the Soviet Union\u2019s aggression by threatening \u201cmassive retaliation\u201d and \u201cmutually assured destruction.\u201d In 1967, around the height of the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear stockpile reached 31,255. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, nuclear weapons-production stalled. The number of U.S. sites involved in making warheads was cut in half. President George H.W. Bush declared a self-imposed nuclear-weapons testing moratorium in 1992. The number of warheads in the U.S. stockpile was continually reduced through a series of arms-control treaties with Moscow. Today the nuclear stockpile stands at an estimated 5,244 warheads\u2014an 83% reduction from its Cold War peak. Read More: The $100 Billion Mission to Modernize America\u2019s Aging Nuclear Missiles. The reduction brought challenges: if the U.S. could no longer build or design the next world-altering bomb, what could government officials do to retain the expertise of scientists? And how would the ensure the integrity of the arsenal without being able to test the products? Nuclear bombs contain more than 4,000 parts, and most of those parts are now more than 30 years old. Ask yourself: If you left a 1993 Ford Mustang in the barn\u2014a temperature-controlled vault of a barn, but a barn nonetheless\u2014would you feel 100% certain that everything would work properly when you turned the ignition? Oh, and don\u2019t forget that your life may depend on it. The answer the Energy Department came up with was to harness computer simulations and experiments to evaluate the reliability\u2014and extend the life spans of\u2014America\u2019s nuclear weapons. The most vexing dilemma was assessing plutonium, an element only discovered 80 years ago. To find out how it ages, Los Alamos ran experiments in the early 2000s that found plutonium pits changed over the years in ways that could impact weapons\u2019 performance. But the studies couldn\u2019t provide specifics on when exactly plutonium aged out. At first, scientists concluded the pits should last for 100 years or more. But in 2019, after Congress began pushing for more pits, JASON, the long-time independent scientific advisory group to the U.S. government, urged the Energy Department to reestablish large-scale pit production \u201cas expeditiously as possible to mitigate against potential risks posed by (plutonium) aging on the stockpile.\u201d The day before my tour of PF-4, I visited the modernistic three-story Municipal Building in Los Alamos to see how the small town was preparing for the coming influx of scientists, technicians, engineers, security guards and support staff. \u201cWe\u2019re building as fast as we can,\u201d says Paul Andrus, the community-development director. Roads are being widened. Expansion plans are underway for Atomic City mass transit. Wooden skeletons of condos and housing developments are in the process of getting built in any area they\u2019ll fit. But finding suitable spots for new construction is a challenge. In addition to the nearly 40-sq. mi. lab, Los Alamos is hemmed in by canyons and abuts Bandelier National Monument. The lack of housing is concerning not only because of the incoming workers, but also the teachers, doctors, and other professionals who will be needed alongside them. \u201cWe\u2019re just out of space,\u201d says Denise Derkacs, a former lab employee who now serves on the county council. \u201cWe would love to help support the lab more, but we just have no more land to build on.\u201d This lack of available space has forced Los Alamos to forge closer ties with communities off the hill. The lab leased two buildings in Santa Fe, located more than 30 miles to the southeast, where it moved hundreds of employees not involved in classified work. The transition, which began in 2021, marked the first time in a half century that the lab had a presence in the city. The pace of expansion is stunning to those familiar with Los Alamos, including Siegfried Hecker, who served as lab director from 1986 to 1997. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the Cold War, but it\u2019s a Cold War-like environment,\u201d Hecker told me. \u201cI did not expect a renewed arms competition when I left Los Alamos.\u201d In the last two years of his term at the lab, Hecker signed the first annual letters of certification attesting to the safety, security, and reliability of the weapons in the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Those letters, delivered each year to the U.S. secretaries of defense and energy, reads in part: \u201cI certify that the nuclear weapons we designed are safe and reliable without the resumption of nuclear testing at this time.\u201d Every sitting president must have this letter on his or her desk to have complete confidence in the nuclear arsenal. Hecker told me signing that letter marked a consequential moment in his life, and in the history of the nation. Resuming pit production is necessary, Hecker believes, because of the unanswered questions about how plutonium ages. But he anticipates the process will trigger calls to resume underground weapons testing in Nevada, in order to redouble confidence in the old stuff and to ensure the new stuff works. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government will do that, because that will open Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we go back and test, we will lose more than we gain.\u201d Of the nine nuclear powers, only North Korea has tested in this century. If the U.S. begins doing so, other nations are sure to follow suit. In the high-stakes world of nuclear weapons, a single political decision sets off an unpredictable chain reaction that can put us all at risk. As we enter this new nuclear era, it\u2019s not yet clear how much we\u2019ve learned from the past.\u2014With reporting by Leslie Dickstein TIME receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Outrider Foundation.

        "title": "How Extreme Weather Is Fueling the Political Right",
        "content": "Last weekend, the climate-related headline on the print issue of the New York Post caught my eye during a gas station pit stop. Instead of focusing on the crazy heat and climate extremes that had dominated other outlets, the cover page headline read \u201cabuse of power\u201d and a spread inside claimed that the state\u2019s green policies would soon dramatically raise the cost of electricity\u2014an easy way to rile readers during the summer months when air conditioning is already driving up electricity bills. It made me think, amid the climate-related disruption currently being experienced across the country, will there be a moment that jolts skeptics into action? It\u2019s easy to see how these scenes could lead to some reflection\u2014and some accelerated action\u2014on the threat climate change poses to human life and society. Indeed, over the past decade I\u2019ve heard a similar argument time and again: eventually climate extremes will force skeptics of climate policy to get with the program. It is an optimistic yet reasonable sounding vision. But, if the past few months are any indicator, it seems something closer to the opposite may be happening. As temperatures have spiked, conservative backlash around the world to climate policy may have also reached a fever pitch. In the U.S., former President Donald Trump has turned electric vehicles into a major attack line targeting President Joe Biden. In a late June speech, he called Biden\u2019s policies \u201cenvironmental extremism\u201d and claimed they were \u201cheartless and disloyal and horrible for the American worker.\u2019 In Spain, Vox, the far-right party, campaigned on softening climate policy, among other things, ahead of a national election on July 23. During the campaign, Vox called the country\u2019s 2021 climate law \u201cthe return to caves and poverty\u201d as the country pushes measures like water conservation to help adapt to a warmer planet. The debate over green policies also infiltrated an important bellwether election in Britain. In the Uxbridge constituency outside of London, on July 20, the Conservative Party unexpectedly won a seat in an election dominated by discussion of expanding congestion pricing. Within hours, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that climate solutions should be executed in a way that is \u201cproportionate and pragmatic\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs in their lives.\u201d (Unlike others listed here, Sunak does support the broader aims of the energy transition). Despite the widely held view that experiencing climate change might lead to wider acceptance of climate policy, research on the link between public opinion and climate events is mixed. In short, it\u2019s not clear exactly how or whether extreme weather triggers people to reassess their views on climate change. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it's clear that partisanship matters here. A 2020 paper in the journal Nature Climate Change pointed to a clear dividing line in the U.S. Extreme weather tends to reinforce the link between climate change and weather effects in Democratic and/or highly educated communities\u2014and less so elsewhere. This dynamic means that extreme weather may actually be creating an opportunity for conservatives to cater to their base. As heat waves or flooding raises the specter of climate change for certain groups, others can use it to raise the specter of the costs of climate policy to rally their most loyal supporters who are primed to oppose it anyway. Politicians and commentators are searching for answers. In Britain, for example, the Labour Party has rolled back its signature green policy amid this consternation. But some analysts are advocating for another approach: keep the policy and get a better message. After all, a world where extreme weather events lead to a backtracking in climate policy would be a scary one indeed. A version of this story also appears in the Climate is Everything newsletter.

        "title": "Performing Under Pressure at the World Cup: Extra Time",
        "content": "This story first appeared in Extra Time, our pop-up newsletter about the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup. Get it in your inbox by subscribing here. Quadrennial events like the World Cup and the Olympics ratchet up pressure like no other. Women soccer players, in particular, have a lot riding on a tournament that comes around once every four years. Unlike the men, many women don\u2019t have lucrative professional club gigs to fall back on. National stardom, sponsorships, and financial futures are at stake for the players who are about to take the field for the 2023 World Cup, which kicks off Thursday morning at 3 a.m. E.T., when New Zealand hosts Norway in Auckland. What\u2019s more, many of these World Cup players are facing external pressures beyond the pitch, and playing for more than just a soccer victory. The American women went through this four years ago, when they were embroiled in an equal-pay lawsuit with their federation while trying to win a second straight World Cup (the U.S. ultimately succeeded, on both fronts). This time, players from England are fighting for World Cup bonuses. The Canadian women are at odds with their federation over pay. Players from Spain and France revolted against their coaches (Spain\u2019s coach is still around, France\u2019s isn\u2019t). The World Cup cauldron is a lot to handle, for any player. (Not to mention for the fans so heavily invested in how their side fares.) So on Tuesday afternoon, I spoke to America\u2019s preeminent scholar on performing under pressure: Sian Beilock, a cognitive psychologist and author of Choke: What the Secrets of the Brain Reveal About Getting It Right When You Have To. She took time out of her day running Dartmouth College, where she started as the school\u2019s new president in June, to offer brain-calming tips for World Cup players\u2014tips that we can also apply to high-stakes situations in our own lives\u2014and a quick word of psychological advice for rabid soccer fans who likely need it. Remember you\u2019re not just a soccer player. \u201cThere are lots of different aspects to who they are,\u201d says Beilock. \u201cPut this situation in context. It\u2019s very important. But they also are moms, or friends. So it takes the pressure off succeeding in just this one part of their lives. Like when I have a bad day as a president, I can fall back on the fact that I\u2019m a mom. When I\u2019m mothering my 12-year-old, I remember there are other aspects of who I am.\u201d The U.S. Women\u2019s National Team (USWNT) features three mothers: Alex Morgan, whose daughter Charlie is 3; Crystal Dunn, whose son Marcel is 1; and Julie Ertz, whose son Madden turns 1 in August. Madden made the trip to New Zealand on the team plane; Charlie and Marcel will join their moms later on during the World Cup. Thankfully, the importance of keeping perspective is top of mind for the U.S. women. On Tuesday, the nonprofit Common Goal, which seeks to utilize soccer to advance social good, announced a partnership with the USWNT and Fox Sports to tackle mental-health stigma during the World Cup. Defender Naomi Girma, a World Cup rookie, penned a moving essay in the Players\u2019 Tribune about her former Stanford teammate Katie Meyer, who died by suicide in March 2022. Girma hopes the World Cup campaign helps save lives. \u201cWe know how important it is to destigmatize the conversation around mental health, especially for the millions of young people around the country who will be watching this World Cup,\u201d Girma writes, \u201cso FOX Sports will be dedicating 1% of its broadcast coverage to spotlighting the importance of mental health across all its platforms.\u201d Forget about practice. Not literally. Neither Beilock nor I recommend that World Cup players ditch training sessions and earn a proper benching. Beilock is basically saying, it\u2019s game time. Trust your training. \u201cNow is the time to stop paying so much attention,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know that when you start focusing on the step by step of what you\u2019re doing, you often mess yourself up. They should be on autopilot at this point. Just as an example, if you\u2019re shuffling down the stairs, and I asked you to think about what you\u2019re doing with your knee, you\u2019ll fall on your face, right? You know how to do it. And so they should remind themselves they\u2019ve done the hard work, they\u2019ve done the practice. Now is the time to go out and enjoy the moment.\u201d Self-compassion wins. \u201cNo one else is as hard on us as we are on ourselves,\u201d says Beilock. \u201cSo remind ourselves that we\u2019re not perfect and that we\u2019re going to be uncomfortable and we\u2019re going to make mistakes and there\u2019s a larger outcome. That can do a lot to take the pressure off.\u201d A few hours before we spoke, Beilock gave a talk to first-year Dartmouth medical students. She encouraged them to embrace discomfort. \u201cIt is not a sign that you\u2019re going to fail,\u201d says Beilock. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that everyone feels this way. And it\u2019s a sign that now you\u2019re going to look for feedback. I\u2019m giving you permission to be uncomfortable.\u201d Beilock got the reaction from the students she was looking for. \u201cI saw a bunch of them sort of sigh, which was nice,\u201d she says. As for the fans, particularly the American ones who consider a USWNT title a birthright, it\u2019s important to remember that the women\u2019s team is \u201cone of a big bucket of things you root for.\u201d Surely, you have other cheering interests: other national teams? Your favorite baseball team or hoops team or college sports team? Your daughter\u2019s softball team? Her academic success and well-being? You do, right? \u201cIt\u2019s not everything,\u201d Beilock says. A useful reminder for any season, World Cup or otherwise. America\u2019s first opponent, Vietnam\u2014the USWNT and the Golden Star Women Warriors play on Friday at 9 p.m. E.T.\u2014has had an inauspicious run-up to the World Cup. On July 13, Spain pummeled Vietnam 9-0 in a friendly in Auckland. Germany\u2019s second string also defeated Vietnam 2-1, in June, in Germany. Vietnam is making its World Cup debut. Forward Huynh Nhu, 31, has won the country\u2019s Golden Ball as the top player on four occasions and is the only Golden Warrior to play professionally outside the country, in Portugal, for L\u00e4nk FC Vilaverdense. Anything less than a U.S. victory would be a major upset. Vietnam is a relatively young women\u2019s soccer squad, having played its first international match in 1997. For more on the Vietnamese team, read this piece by TIME\u2019s Koh Ewe. Vietnam survived a round-robin playoff against Thailand and Chinese Taipei to qualify for the World Cup. Four years ago, the U.S. opened its World Cup defense with a 13-0 victory over Thailand. The Americans continued to celebrate their goals late in the game, setting off a furious debate back home about sportsmanship. Vietnam should offer more resistance than Thailand. But if the U.S. lights up the scoreboard Friday, don\u2019t expect much muted joy. The USWNT never apologized for relishing that moment four years ago. Why start now? You may have come across this viral video out of France. Orange, the telecommunications company that sponsors France\u2019s soccer federation, created a two-minute ad highlighting the athleticism of France\u2019s men\u2019s team. Which seemed sort of odd before a women\u2019s World Cup. Midway through the video, the creators reveal the twist: the men, it turns out, weren\u2019t responsible for those standout plays. Computer imaging just made them look like male French stars such as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Those were actually highlights of France\u2019s women\u2019s team. One TikTok post featuring the commercial got 8.5 million views. As Koh Ewe wrote for TIME, the ad neatly dovetailed with academic research published a week ago, which found that \u201cthe quality of men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer performances are actually judged similarly when the gender of the players is obscured. When the players\u2019 gender was revealed to the study subjects, however, men\u2019s soccer performances were rated significantly more highly.\u201d Marcel, a French ad agency, produced the spot: I tracked down the company\u2019s co-CEO, Pascal Nessim, while he was on vacation in the south of France. He said a creative team at Marcel brought him the idea, which he signed off on. \u201cIt\u2019s a magical demonstration that women\u2019s soccer can be as impressive as men\u2019s soccer,\u201d says Nessim. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to create a transformative campaign. It helps change the point of view.\u201d But Nessim never expected the clip to catch on like this. He says he\u2019s enjoying his holiday. It\u2019s now official. On Monday, Netflix announced that it will stream a multipart, all-access docuseries on the USWNT\u2019s World Cup run in the fall. TIME Studios is co-producing the project, along with Words + Pictures and Togethxr. The series will be directed by Rebecca Gitlitz of TIME Studios, a two-time Emmy winner. Connor Schell, the Emmy-winning producer responsible for The Last Dance, OJ: Made In America and ESPN\u2019s 30 for 30 series, is one of the executive producers. We have cameras on the ground in New Zealand and will be following the USWNT throughout the tournament. I\u2019ve gotten a sneak peek at some of the interviews and footage captured so far: the material is, in all honesty, very compelling. The producers were on hand, for example, when USWNT coach Vladko Andonovski let one of the players know she had made the team. The player sat on the so-called \u201cbubble\u201d\u2014her place on the team was no lock. You won\u2019t want to miss her raw, emotional reaction when she heard the news. We hope to be sharing snippets of the documentary reporting throughout the tournament. (But not too much! Tune in to the Netflix series, in a few months, for the good stuff.) Some other highlights of TIME\u2019s World Cup coverage. From Yasmeen Serhan: How Women\u2019s Soccer Exploded in Britain. From Tom Farrey, executive director of the Aspen Institute\u2019s Sports & Society Program: Let\u2019s Start Treating Knee Injuries Like Brain Injuries Trinity Rodman Is More Than Her Famous Last Name Elsewhere around the web: Japan\u2019s women\u2019s soccer team struggles to grow support at home (Bloomberg) A friendly between Ireland and Colombia got a little unfriendly (CNN) America\u2019s business owners stare down punishing World Cup timings (Al Jazeera) \u2013 Something to keep in mind as you begin to watch the tournament: unlike the other so-called \u201cflow sports,\u201d like basketball and hockey, soccer coaches can\u2019t rotate their players in and out of games at the international level. In that sense, soccer is like baseball. Once a player\u2019s taken out of the game, she can\u2019t return. Each side can make five subs per game at the 2023 World Cup, with an extra sixth sub reserved for players who suffer a head injury and must be removed. \u2013 While much of the world swelters, Auckland is feeling a bit chilly. American midfielder Rose LaVelle has impressed journalists with her attire: while at least one reporter wore a winter coat during a USWNT training session, Lavelle, a University of Wisconsin alum, practiced sleeveless and in shorts. Lavelle is a key player, but a pre-World Cup injury has worried USWNT observers. Will she be ready to go? If Lavelle\u2019s taking on the cold head up, that seems like a strong sign she\u2019s thriving. We\u2019ll discover Lavelle\u2019s status soon enough. Finally, kickoff is near. Look out for Extra Time in your inbox this Saturday; we\u2019ll break down the U.S. opener, and surely overreact to the good and the bad. That\u2019s part of the fun. Speak to you then.",

        "title": "The Food to Eat During a Heat Wave",
        "content": "As temperatures continue to climb in what could become the northern hemisphere\u2019s hottest summer on record, the summer of 2023 is all about finding any way to stay cool. And that includes turning to foods that will hopefully provide a little relief. While not a panacea for the heat, body-cooling foods and no-cook diets could help to lower body temperature and make record-breaking heat waves a little more bearable.. Living safely in consistently hot climates means staying hydrated, especially with chilled drinks or fruits. But there are other, more physiologically based\u2014and even surprising\u2014ways to make your diet more heat friendly. While the science behind diets, nutrition, and climate is still growing, changing global temperatures makes understanding the link between food and metabolism increasingly critical. One place to start is to explore how heat influences diets in warmer parts of the world. Why, for example, do the spiciest foods come from the hottest places on the planet? Think southeast Asian curries and peppers, and South American chilis. If spicy foods make you sweat and feel even hotter, why are they such a staple in warmer regions? There\u2019s a biological reason for that, says Dr. William Li, a former Harvard Medical School faculty member who has written a book about finding the right diet for your metabolism. What happens when you dig into a spicy dish? Your heart beats a little faster, you breathe a little harder, you start to perspire, and not just your mouth but your whole body can feel as if it\u2019s on fire. And if you\u2019re eating this dish and it\u2019s above 90F outside, you\u2019re really feeling the heat. But sweating is the body\u2019s physiological response to being too hot. \u201cOur sole means of cooling is to sweat,\u201d says Dr. Linda Shiue, an internist and chef who is director of culinary and lifestyle medicine at Kaiser Permanente San Francisco. Once you sweat, the perspiration evaporating moisture cools the skin. We\u2019re not talking tens of degrees here\u2014it\u2019s fractions of single digits of change in temperature, but it\u2019s still something. If the body\u2019s core temperature starts climbing\u2014which it does if you\u2019re exposed to extreme heat for too long\u2014sweating cools off the skin in an attempt to bring that core temperature down. Eating spicy foods jumpstarts that process, which is why they\u2019re so popular in hotter regions of the world. \u201cCultures in these parts of the world have known this for thousands of years,\u201d says Li. \u201cTheir culinary culture triggers a hard-wired system that opens your pores and releases heat from the body. You feel temporarily hotter but that\u2019s part of the package of cooling down.\u201d That hard-wired system involves a protein on our cells called TRPV1, which acts as a receptor for the active agents in spicy foods, such as capsaicin and capsinoids. The cells that have the highest concentration of TRPV1 receptors are on the tongue and the front of the roof of the mouth. Those spice agents trigger the receptors to send signals to the brain to release norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter primarily responsible for launching the fight-or-flight response. When this hyper-alert response is triggered, the body releases heat by triggering the sweats. That was helpful to human ancestors trying to outrun potential predators thousands of years ago\u2026and also turns out to be useful in adapting to climate change today. There are a bunch of foods and spices that can activate TRPV1. In addition to hot peppers, sweet peppers and black pepper can also stimulate the receptor. Garlic can as well, through a different chemical called diallyl sulfide, which doesn\u2019t produce the same spicy sensation in the mouth but has the same end effect of activating norepinephrine and generating perspiration. Ginger and galangal, another root vegetable with a sharp, citrusy taste, are other foods\u2014also commonly used in hotter regions\u2014that can cause the same sweating and cooling effect. Read more on extreme heat: How to sleep when it\u2019s really hot outside The difference between heat stress, exhaustion, and stroke The art of air conditioner maintenance Extreme heat hits companies where it hurts There are also other, less obvious foods that work on TRPV1, but the data supporting how they are connected isn\u2019t solid enough yet. There is anecdotal data suggesting, for example, that fruits such as durian and pineapple can help to cool, but in different ways. Durian may activate TRPV1 and generate perspiration, while an enzyme in pineapple called bromelain can slow digestion, which reduces the amount of energy, and therefore heat, generated by that process. In Mexico, says Shiue, people often season their helpings of fruit\u2014which are helpful for staying hydrated when the weather is warm\u2014with tajin, a blend of dried chilis, lime juice, and salt. Another popular seasoning in the region is chamoy, made from pickled fruit and chilis. \u201cHow brilliant is this as a way to keep yourself cool as well as hydrated?\u201d she says. In India, known for its long periods of hot days, the beverage of choice is nimbu pani, a mix of lemon or lime juice, salt, and sugar that not only cools but replaces electrolytes lost when the body is over heated. Early data from animals also suggests that cinnamon can lower the stomach\u2019s temperature by decreasing the amount of acid and enzymes secreted by cells, which can cool the body by as much as two degrees C. More conflicting data suggests that ingesting or smoking CBD could produce the same \u2018flushed\u2019 feeling and generate perspiration similar to the way spicy foods can, but more research is needed to verify this body-cooling effect.. Metabolically, there\u2019s another way that the TRPV1 system helps to keep the body cool that\u2019s also counterintuitive at first. TRPV1 can burn brown fat, which is more abundant in newborns but is still present in adults, primarily in the neck, upper chest, and under the arms. In colder climates, people burn more of this brown fat because it\u2019s a super-efficient way to generate body heat. That\u2019s because in order to generate more heat, brown fat works together with white fat\u2014the more common form of fat that people gain with age as their metabolism slows down\u2014and starts using it as fuel. So when the body\u2019s core temperature really starts to rise, brown fat can kick in to counterintuitively make people sweat even more, in an effort to cool down. Looking more broadly, Li says there are other ways that people might adapt their eating as the world warms. Cutting back on daily calories can lower core body temperature, since when your body processes calories, it generates energy and heat. A 2011 study showed that reducing daily calorie intake by 23% can lower body temperature by under half a degree celsius. That may not sound like a huge drop, but when combined with other strategies, could help prevent heat stroke and related issues. Intermittent fasting can also lower body temperature by triggering the body to burn calories differently. When we eat, we produce insulin to help break down those calories or store them as fat. During fasting, the body starts delving into those fat deposits for energy\u2014in a way that generates less heat than the insulin-creating process. The body may be taking advantage of this strategy during extremely hot periods; when it\u2019s uncomfortably hot, most people\u2019s appetites start to wane, and this may be a physiologic coping mechanism for surviving the heat. \u201cThe body does anything it can to minimize the intake of energy and the generation of more heat, and that includes eating,\u201d says Shiue. That\u2019s not to say that fasting is a solution to keeping cool, since whatever small temperature benefits that come with it must be balanced with the potential dangers of becoming malnourished. The science of how the human body\u2019s energy needs change with heat, and therefore how heat affects things like how much and what people eat, is still in its early stages. But the latest studies on receptors like TRPV1 could help the world adapt to climate change as temperatures keep rising. \u201cAs we better understand how foods in certain cultures have been beneficial in cooling, I think it would be natural to adapt some of those ingredients in the culinary style of eating of the western world,\u201d says Li. Shiue agrees. \u201cIf people know that yes, certain ways of eating have a function such as cooling the body, then maybe they will start to creep into our daily food choices,\u201d she says. Which would make diets one more aspect of human existence that could be forever transformed by climate change.",

        "content": "Less than a minute into the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team\u2019s (USWNT) World Cup opening against Vietnam on Friday night, American forward Trinity Rodman fell to the turf. A Vietnamese defender swiped her leg going for a ball. For a moment, the young star\u2019s World Cup debut looked like it would be maddeningly brief. Megan Rapinoe started to stretch, getting ready to replace Rodman. After receiving some treatment on the sideline, however, Rodman came back into the game. But the Golden Star Women Warriors were sending an unsubtle message: Vietnam was not going to roll over. The Warriors would play rough, would play sharp defense, and refuse to give up double-digit goals. This would assuredly be no repeat of 2019, when the U.S. beat Thailand 13-0. The U.S. still won the game fairly easily, 3-0. Sophia Smith\u2014another World Cup rookie member of the generation of forwards carrying the USWNT into the future but making their mark in the present\u2014turned in a spectacular debut, scoring two first-half goals and assisting on the third. The first breakthrough came in the 14th minute, when Alex Morgan flicked a beautiful pass to Smith, who was streaking down the left side of the field and fired a shot through the legs of Vietnam keeper Thi Kim Thanh Tran. Then in the first-half stoppage time, Kim Thanh mishandled a saveable Smith shot; it was a rare error from Kim Thanh, who made several nice saves and blocks in a valiant effort. Sign up for \u2018Extra Time,\u2019 our new newsletter that will break down the biggest moments from the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup Vietnam was playing to keep the game close. It put all their players back on defense, so the USWNT faced a sea of red jerseys almost every time it had possession. The Golden Star Women Warriors\u2019 offense was, well, non-existent. The USWNT\u2019s defensive back line didn\u2019t face much of an attack: Julie Ertz moved up front for a few scoring chances, but for the most part, she could have spent 90 minutes FaceTiming her son Madden, who\u2019s almost a year old and in New Zealand. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naher did not face a single shot. She could have enjoyed a Speight\u2019s or two. The Americans could have easily pumped in more goals: missed chances are a legitimate concern coming out of this game, as future opponents are expected to be more of a challenge. Aside from her assist to Smith, Morgan was a bit off her game. She missed a penalty shot in the first half, when the U.S. was up a goal. And at the start of the second half, a Rodman cross landed right on the foot of midfielder Linsey Horan, who shanked the opportunity. But Horan made up for it later on. In the 77th minute, Ertz lobbed a nifty ball that Smith chased down on the right wing. Tran left her line to challenge Smith, who crossed it to Horan about 12 yards in front of goal. She fired the shot in to make it 3-0. Megan Rapinoe made her 200th appearance in a U.S. uniform, when she replaced Morgan in the 61st minute. In the 71st minute, midfielder Rose Lavelle, who like Rapinoe has been fighting injuries coming into this World Cup and came in as a second-half sub, set Rapinoe up for a valedictory goal. (Rapinoe is playing in her last World Cup). But Rapinoe sent the shot high. Horan sorta laughed Rapinoe\u2019s error\u2019s off. Rapinoe, still competing at 38, just looked ticked. In all, the Americans took care of business. The USWNT avoided any kind of disaster on the scoreboard, or with injuries. They got the win and the 3 points. The final tally wasn\u2019t a laugher, but the Americans dominated the game. The USWNT will now face the Netherlands, the 2019 World Cup runners-up, on Wednesday. The quest for history\u2014a third straight World Cup\u2014remains on track.",

        "title": "New Technique Restores Motion and Feeling to Paralyzed Man",
        "content": "Acluster of researchers surround 45-year-old Keith Thomas, their eyes fixed on his right hand. \u201cOpen, open, open,\u201d they urge, cheering when his fingers flutter out to mirror an image on a computer screen and again when they begin to curl back inward. Thomas, who was paralyzed from the chest down after a diving accident in July 2020, is able to move his hand again thanks to a cutting-edge clinical trial led by researchers from Northwell Health\u2019s Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in New York. Chad Bouton, a bioengineer at the Feinstein Institutes who is leading the trial, says he believes Thomas is the first human in the world to receive a double neural bypass, a technology that links his brain, spinal cord, and body in hopes of restoring both his ability to move and his sense of touch\u2014even outside the laboratory. So far, the therapy seems to be working. Thomas is now able to lift his arms and can feel sensations on his skin, including the touch of his sister\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s indescribable,\u201d Thomas says, \u201cto be able to feel something.\u201d When Thomas began working with Bouton\u2019s lab in 2021, he couldn\u2019t lift his arms off his wheelchair frame. For about a year, to help Bouton and his team get a sense of his baseline post-accident function, Thomas\u2019 primary task was to watch hands moving on a computer screen and try to copy their motions. Much to his frustration, his body couldn't match his mind's commands. That changed after a 15-hour surgery in March 2023, during which neurosurgeon Dr. Ashesh Mehta placed five tiny, fragile electrode arrays in the hyper-specific regions of Thomas\u2019 brain that control motion and feeling in his right hand and fingers. To confirm he\u2019d found the right spots, Mehta awakened Thomas during surgery and stimulated those areas of the brain. Immediately, he says, Thomas could feel some of his fingers for the first time in almost three years. \u201cIt was a very good feeling,\u201d Mehta says. Now, when Thomas thinks about moving\u2014imagining himself squeezing a bottle, for example\u2014the arrays transmit the electrical signals in his brain to an amplifier on his skull, which via an HDMI cable passes the signals on to a gaming computer sitting a few feet away. The computer decodes those messages and sends a signal to electrodes placed on Thomas\u2019 skin, which stimulate the muscles he needs to perform the motion he\u2019s envisioning. The whole thing happens almost in real time, though it takes effort on Thomas\u2019 part to imagine and attempt the movement. This process feels harder on some days than others, Thomas says, and it\u2019s not always clear why. But after all those months of staring at hands, Thomas can finally use his. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing,\u201d he says. Along with motion, Thomas is also regaining a sense of feeling. When he touches an object or person, sensors on his skin send a signal to the computer, which then communicates with the arrays in his brain. He can now feel a hand in his, or a feather stroking the sensors on his fingertips. Touch doesn\u2019t feel exactly how it did before the accident\u2014Thomas describes it as a burst of energy\u2014but it\u2019s progress. \u201cTouching someone\u2019s hand and feeling that is such an important part of life,\u201d Bouton says. An accurate sense of touch is also essential for carrying out functional tasks, like buttoning a shirt or holding a styrofoam coffee cup without crushing it. Thomas\u2019 case shows how far paralysis research has advanced in the last few decades. About 20 years ago, researchers began demonstrating that brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)\u2014like the one now used by Thomas\u2014could help people with paralysis perform tasks using their thoughts. About a decade later, building upon research that showed humans with paralysis could use their thoughts to control robotic limbs, Bouton and his team used a neural bypass to restore movement, but not sensation, to the arm of a man who had been paralyzed in an accident. In the years since, research teams have used spinal-cord stimulation to restore mobility to people recovering from accidents or strokes. And earlier this year, a scientific team reported that they\u2019d helped a man with paralysis begin to walk naturally again by creating a bridge between his brain and spinal cord. The new trial with Thomas (results from which have not yet been published in a scientific journal) pushes the field forward by \u201ccombining all the elements\u2014brain, body, and spine\u2014and movement and the sense of touch,\u201d Bouton says. Unlike in his previous neural-bypass work, Bouton adds, Thomas is slowly but surely relearning to move and feel even when he\u2019s not attached to the computer system in the laboratory. That\u2019s thanks to the extra connection between his brain and spinal cord, in addition to the bridge between his brain and body. Each time Thomas performs a motion when he is attached to the computer, the system stimulates the portion of his spinal cord that sits just below his injury\u2014essentially, reestablishing contact between his brain and spinal cord and helping his body train to again move and feel on its own. \u201cThat electrical stimulation, we believe, is awakening circuits that have been damaged and dormant for three years,\u201d Bouton says. Only a few months post-operation, Thomas is able to move his arms when he\u2019s not connected to the computer and can describe where on his arm he\u2019s being touched, even with his eyes closed. The team has also observed small natural movements in his fingers, another good sign. Thomas\u2019 spirits are up, he says, now that he can see his accomplishments during his twice-weekly visits to the Feinstein Institutes, which he spends cracking jokes and listening to his favorite musician, Harry Styles. Thomas is motivated to keep going both by his own gains and by the promise of pioneering a technology that could someday help others, he says. Widespread adoption of neural bypass technology is likely a ways off; it\u2019s taken millions of dollars in research funding and a team of dozens to get Thomas to this point. (The clinical trial that Bouton is running aims to test the technology in up to three people, but Thomas is the first to be implanted.) In hopes of benefitting a larger group of people, Bouton is also working on a separate, non-invasive system meant to stimulate movement through electrodes placed on the skin\u2014no surgery required. Bouton says such a product could be a good fit for people with less-extensive paralysis, such as those who have suffered a stroke, or who don\u2019t want to undergo brain surgery. If the system works for those populations, Bouton says, \u201cnow you\u2019ve opened up the door to millions and millions of folks around the world.\u201d",

        "title": "Ron DeSantis' Latest Staff Shakeup Is Part of a Pattern",
        "content": "Ron DeSantis is looking for a fresh start. Last week, the Florida governor fired roughly a dozen staffers and offloaded two top aides to a pro-DeSantis super PAC, signaling a campaign reset amid an existential crisis: He\u2019s failed to meet fundraising goals, burned cash at an alarming clip, and has been faltering in the polls. If things don\u2019t turn around soon, there may be more layoffs, according to sources familiar with the matter, who say that donors are exasperated with the campaign\u2019s underwhelming performance thus far. Yet the latest staff shakeup isn\u2019t an anomaly within the arc of DeSantis\u2019 career. It\u2019s part of a larger pattern of a politician who has struggled to maintain a core group of trusted advisers or loyal employees. During his five years in Congress, his office had one of the highest turnover rates in the House. No employed member from his victorious 2018 gubernatorial campaign team is working in a senior role on his 2024 presidential race. And things didn\u2019t change when he became governor. In his first term, he fired staffers with enough regularity that some formed an emotional support group, according to a 2021 Politico report. Now, DeSantis is shedding staff only two months into his bid to beat out former President Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. DeSantis\u2019 long history of staffing woes has been a red flag to some of the party\u2019s veteran hands. One prominent GOP operative in touch with DeSantis, who requested anonymity to speak freely, advised him last winter that he would struggle to compete at the national level without a cohesive campaign nucleus. \u201cI told him early on: In my lifetime, I\u2019ve never watched someone win a major race\u2014not a congressional race, but a major contested race\u2014without being able to keep a team and trust the team,\u201d the source recounts to TIME. It\u2019s a reason why that same Republican operative warned high-net-worth donors who were looking for an alternative to Trump against investing too heavily in DeSantis until they could see how he performed as a presidential candidate. \u201cPeople who were big players were thinking about giving 50 or 100 million dollars,\u201d the source says. \u201cI told them, \u2018You should stitch that in and see if he can make it more than six months with actual professionals in charge.\u2019\u201d Since DeSantis formally entered the race in May through a glitch-riddled announcement on Twitter, he hasn\u2019t inspired more confidence. A national Reuters/Ipsos poll from last week has Trump leading him by a commanding 28-point margin. It comes as Trump\u2019s multiple criminal indictments have only appeared to endear him more to Republican primary voters. The DeSantis camp is trying to reassure donors that it can turn things around. In private meetings with top contributors, they\u2019ve said they believe adverse press coverage has hampered the campaign rollout and have vowed to embark on a new strategy. \u201cNo matter how much the media and D.C. elites try to destroy Ron DeSantis, they can\u2019t change the fact that this is a two-man race for the nomination,\u201d the campaign\u2019s communications director Andrew Romeo tells TIME. \u201cRon DeSantis is ready to prove the doubters wrong yet again and our campaign is prepared to execute on his vision for the Great American Comeback as we transition into the next phase of winning this primary and beating Joe Biden.\u201d Read More: The DeSantis Project Yet those who\u2019ve worked with the Florida governor before expect staff turnover to continue to plague his presidential bid. They say he has never been one to forge lasting emotional bonds with people who work for him. \u201cThe same struggle that he has with voters, he has with staff,\u201d another Republican operative familiar with the DeSantis campaign operation tells TIME. \u201cWhen things start to sour, it\u2019s easy for staff to either leave on their own volition, or it\u2019s easy for the boss to ultimately cut staff loose. There are no personal connections there.\u201d One person who has been at DeSantis\u2019 side through every campaign is his wife Casey, who has a heavy influence over his political strategy. That dynamic has led some to doubt that any staffing changes can truly reorient the campaign when it will always be the two of them calling the shots. \u201cHis top advisor comes with the house,\u201d the source close to DeSantis says. \u201cIt\u2019s his wife. There\u2019s no firing his spouse. The idea that DeSantis can do a reset is a complete fallacy.\u201d While early campaign issues are an ominous sign for DeSantis\u2019 2024 presidential ambitions, there is some precedent for a Republican presidential candidate clinching the party\u2019s nomination after a major staff shakeup. In July 2007, John McCain dropped two of his top political aides, at the same point of the 2008 presidential election cycle. \u201cThe guy had run for president once already and still had to completely recalibrate,\u201d says Jon Seaton, who worked on George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection campaign and McCain\u2019s 2008 bid. \u201cJohn McCain was kind of proof positive that a rocky rollout doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your campaign is doomed.\u201d But there were also significant differences between the two primaries. McCain, a longtime Senator from Arizona, entered that race as the likely frontrunner, and neither of his main competitors\u2014former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney\u2014had anything resembling the loyalty of Trump\u2019s base. DeSantis, on the other hand, is going up against the most dominant force in GOP politics. Presidential campaigns inevitably face adversities and vicissitudes. That\u2019s why seasoned campaign veterans say a candidate needs people who have been through the trenches with them before. It\u2019s a source of consternation and confusion to Whit Ayres, a GOP consultant who worked on the 2018 DeSantis gubernatorial campaign, that no one from that team is part of his inner circle now. \u201cHe will have nothing to do with anyone associated with that close, amazing victory,\u201d Ayres tells TIME. \u201cHe will have nothing to do with the general consultant, the campaign manager, the financial consultant, neither one of the media firms, or the polling firm. Most of the time when politicians win races, especially when they\u2019re close, hard-fought races, they keep at least some members of the team that helped them win. But he basically will have nothing to do with any of them.\u201d In that election, DeSantis beat his rival, Democrat Andrew Gillum, by roughly 30,000 votes. Trump and his team are quick to point out that DeSantis secured the nomination with Trump\u2019s endorsement months earlier. Now that he\u2019s running against the former President, Trump has called him \u201cungrateful\u201d and a \u201clousy candidate\u201d who only rose to the governor\u2019s mansion on his coattails. But the challenge for DeSantis going forward may be whether he can re-introduce himself as a credible new standard bearer for a Republican Party that doesn\u2019t seem ready to move on from Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of already defined himself,\u201d the GOP operative who previously worked with DeSantis says. \u201cThat\u2019s the tough part about where he is: He is very well known by our base. He\u2019s pre-defined. That doesn\u2019t leave him a lot of wiggle room to maneuver.\u201d",

        "title": "Why Many Adults Struggle With Bedwetting",
        "content": "When Ben was 13, he walked into his bunk at a Wisconsin summer camp to see his worst fear realized: About half a dozen other boys, his friends and bunkmates, giggling as they rummaged through his suitcase and his pile of pull-up diapers. Each night at camp, Ben would wait for the bunk to fall silent so that he could tiptoe off to the bathroom with a pull-up from his well-hidden stash in case he peed in his sleep. For days, he\u2019d gone to bed late and woken up early so that nobody would discover he was a bedwetter. But now, after letting slip to a hungry friend that he had snacks in his bag, the secret was out. \u201cEveryone was kind of just throwing them around,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was traumatizing.\u201d Ben, who\u2019s now 23 and requested he be referred to only by his first name (as did many of the others TIME spoke with for this story), is one of the many adults who struggle with bedwetting. About 1-3% of U.S. adults have \u201cnocturnal enuresis,\u201d the term used to describe uncontrollable nighttime urination in anyone age 5 or older. And while the long-term health risks are minimal, the social and emotional repercussions of wetting the bed past early childhood can be so devastating that they practically merit a diagnosis all their own. There\u2019s fear, isolation, and secrecy; missed opportunities, experiences, and connections. More than anything else, there\u2019s shame. There are two kinds of nocturnal enuresis in adults: primary and secondary. Primary describes people like Ben, who\u2019ve wet the bed consistently\u2014anywhere between every night and twice a year\u2014since childhood. Secondary describes people who hit standard benchmarks as children and then suddenly began bedwetting again years later. While the latter is almost always brought on by old age, trauma, or injury, nobody really knows what causes primary nocturnal enuresis, though both types are markedly more common in men. What\u2019s more, there are no surefire treatments for primary nocturnal enuresis, which means that many sufferers endure an emotionally taxing gauntlet of failed treatments in adolescence only to be left with an even more painful sense of defeat and resignation before even turning 18. Sooner or late, the doctor\u2019s appointments stop, and the protective wall of secrecy goes back up. Some people with the condition continue to lean on family. Most talk to no one. The majority of people who wet the bed past childhood have a grade-school horror story\u2014usually around a school trip or slumber party. At home, it\u2019s easier to deal with wet sheets in privacy, and that insularity makes it easier to believe the issue will eventually resolve itself. \u201cAround age 11 or 12 is when I realized that this is something that\u2019s not \u2018normal\u2019 to still be doing: to be still wetting the bed, to still be in diapers,\u201d says Ben. When sleepovers do start, the secretive pull-up method is the most popular choice, aside from avoiding nights away altogether. Ben says that the anxiety he felt attending sleepovers was so great that \u201cthey weren\u2019t even enjoyable.\u201d Sam, a 29-year-old schoolteacher from London, remembers his own concerns ratcheting up around early adolescence as well, particularly when his younger brother\u2019s bedwetting stopped before his. \u201cThat was the time when it turned from something I was really shy and self-conscious about into something that really tormented me,\u201d he says, \u201cand I could tell my parents were frustrated too.\u201d Many families believe the fewer people who know, the better. Occasionally, to smooth out the required plotting, a trusted educator or mentor is looped in. \u201cIn year 8, we had a French [class] trip\u201d to France, says Sam, \u201cand I remember my mom phoning school saying, \u2018He doesn\u2019t want to come, because he\u2019s worried about being bullied.\u2019\u201d The big concern for the trip was spending the night aboard a bus, which meant that Sam and his mother had to arrange for a teacher to stay awake and notify Sam when they\u2019d stopped at the last service station for the night. \u201cI was like, \u2018How at the age of 16, 17, do I go on this trip and tell the teachers that this is still an issue?\u2019\u201d he says. Now, as a teacher himself, Sam is on high alert for students he thinks might be dealing with the same hidden anxieties. \u201cI quite like the fact that I know how to deal with it better than any other adult that I work with,\u201d he says. He\u2019s talked openly about his experiences with a few children at his school who also wet the bed, but finds that he\u2019s often walking a tightrope when trying to gently guide colleagues on overnight class trips toward best practices without having to explain where his expertise comes from. As teens grow older, the problem can become harder and harder to hide. In college, where a roommate often means no privacy in your own bedroom, many bedwetters opt for single dorm rooms, even if they\u2019d otherwise want the social experience of having a roommate. Carrying the burden of this secret can lead to introversion and anxiety that can make even simpler socializing feel just not worth it. Racquel, a 23-year old in Texas, remembers years of double-bagging soiled diapers in plastic and carrying them home from sleepovers in her overnight bag so that nobody would find them in a friend\u2019s trash can. \u201cI would rather do anything than tell someone that it had happened,\u201d she says. These types of experiences, she says, \u201cled to this weird anxiety around not wanting to be away from home because I won\u2019t have all my stuff.\u201d For teens and adults with the condition today, there are pockets of online support, if you know where to find them. Message boards and review sites allow people to anonymously recommend sympathetic therapists and physicians, and a subreddit dedicated to adult bedwetting is one space to share and read stories and experiences. Racquel says she was shocked to discover her traumas weren\u2019t unique when she came across the page in adulthood. But a fear of being outed in real life\u2014and the fetishests who reportedly prowl the forum\u2014means that building one-on-one connections there can be difficult. Community is useful, but for those engaged in militant secret-keeping, any degree of risk is too much. Read More: How Big Tech Weaponizes Our Shame One of the more difficult interpersonal challenges adult bedwetters can face is dating. \u201cThere\u2019s just no good point to bring it up,\u201d says Bob, a 38-year-old software engineer in Alabama who\u2019s remained single most of his life. \u201cAnd what do you even say?\u201d Every bedwetter has heard the same refrain about dating from close friends and family, Bob and others say: If they\u2019re a good person, they won\u2019t care. Though those who\u2019ve ventured out into the dating pool often find this to be true in practice, the anxiety seems to reset with each new relationship. For something so intimate, it can feel overwhelming to not always be able to share it on your own timeline. When I talked to Raquel in March, she was planning to sit down for a serious talk with her boyfriend of six months. Racquel\u2019s nocturnal enuresis disappeared for two years in early adolescence and re-emerged when she was diagnosed with diabetes at age 16. In adulthood, she\u2019d go for months without an incident, and, through early 2023, hadn\u2019t had one for the past 10 months\u2014until just before we spoke. \u201cI thought it was gone,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just like, I\u2019m a normal person!\u201d Earlier that week, she\u2019d taken a chance and stayed overnight for the first time with her boyfriend. She woke up to wet blankets. Are you kidding me? she thought. After all this time? She\u2019d steeled herself for a breakup before her boyfriend even awoke. To her surprise, he woke up grinning. \u201cDid you pee on me?\u201d he asked her, casually. \u201cAre you sure it was you?\u201d Then he climbed out of bed, grabbed a towel and a different blanket, and climbed back in to hold a stunned and teary Raquel. Assuming it was a one-time accident, he assured her it could just as easily happen to him. Despite his reaction, Raquel seemed confident that disclosing her chronic problem was going to end the relationship. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that if I weren\u2019t directly dealing with this issue, I wouldn\u2019t be tolerant of it in a partner,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just very logical to me if someone doesn\u2019t want to spend every night with the person they love wondering if they might wake up with that person\u2019s piss on them.\u201d The night after Raquel told her boyfriend all about her nocturnal enuresis, we spoke again. The talk had gone well. He didn\u2019t break up with her; he just asked what he could do to help. Studies have identified certain psychological risk factors related to bedwetting among younger children, including family stress and temperament issues, but there\u2019s much less research on why PNE persists so much longer in some people. By age 5, 85% of children stop wetting the bed, with significant drop-offs in the first few years after. Dr. Audrey Rhee heads up the Center for Pediatric Urology at the Cleveland Clinic. Most cases Rhee sees are primary nocturnal enuresis, and a portion of those patients suffer from developmental disorders and other serious health conditions in which cognitive and physiological deficits can cause bedwetting. Sometimes there are more minor comorbidities: Children with autism, for instance, are more likely to be affected by PNE. For the rest of Rhee\u2019s PNE patients, the issue is more often than not unexplainable, and likely has a complex web of genetic causes relating to urine production and bladder control. Motivation is key for behavioral modification, which is the first of three treatment options\u2014followed by devices and medications\u2014that urologists like Rhee will try once causes like legitimate sleep disorders such as apnea are off the table. Often, her recommendations involve tweaks to improve a child\u2019s sleep hygiene and basic bathroom access: measures like limiting screen time before bed, cutting out caffeine and bladder-irritating foods like artificial colorings, and making sure that a kid isn\u2019t tucked away on a top bunk where getting to the toilet requires a climb. Rhee discourages parents from being disciplinary, or \u201csetting the expectation that if their child is wet in the morning, they\u2019ve already lost for the day. They already feel bad.\u201d Punitive responses to bedwetting have been linked to depression in children, which can interrupt healthy sleep and make the problem worse. After behavioral modification, Rhee\u2019s patients get bumped up to level two: the alarms. These small, brightly colored devices are made up of a playing-card-sized speaker the wearer pins to their shirt, connected to a wire that trails down to a sensor clipped inside their underwear. When the sensor gets wet, an alarm blares. The concept is simple; the execution is often lacking. The basic conditioning approach of the alarm only works if it\u2019s worn every night. Rhee says that \u201conly 20 or 25% of families actually use it appropriately\u201d\u2014in part because the alarm is often loud enough to also wake the rest of the household, the neighborhood, and the dead. To work, \u201cthe entire family has to buy in\u201d\u2014Rhee often sees sleep-deprived parents throwing in the towel or cutting corners after just a few weeks of nightly wear. But, if used correctly over the course of three or four months, Rhee says, the alarms can have a high success rate\u2014the literature puts it at around 75%. Sam never wanted to try bedwetting alarms as a child or teenager, a decision his parents respected, but he did allow his doctor to prescribe him the third remedy typically offered by urologists for persistent bedwetting: a drug called Desmopressin, or DDAVP. Most people with persistent PNE will end up doing a stint on DDAVP, which works by mimicking a hormone that slows urine production and usually circulates in higher levels at night. Some physicians prefer to prescribe DDAVP before trying alarms, particularly for older patients. Like many PNE treatments, it works better for some than for others: Its success rate can be as high as 80%, but relapse is common. Ben took DDAVP for about six or seven months in middle school, he says, but stopped after it caused incessant morning headaches\u2014a common side effect\u2014and only \u201csort of\u201d worked. \u201cI would wet the bed maybe three or four times a week instead of five or six,\u201d he says. Rhee describes DDAVP as \u201ca band-aid\u201d\u2014good to help improve the odds of a dry spell for a vacation, summer camp, or sleepover, but \u201ccertainly not a long-term solution.\u201d There are other drugs, like imipramine and bladder-relaxing anticholinergics, that work similarly or boost the efficacy of DDVAP, but the results are often the same. By the time kids and teens have made it through this gauntlet of treatment, getting their hopes up time and time again, many shift their focus to accepting life as a bedwetter. They have a system, and know what works for them. \u201cOnce I moved on to coping and acceptance, actually ordering the right [incontinence] products and dealing with it, I actually felt a lot better about it,\u201d says Sam. Daily management of nocturnal enuresis varies, and can look dramatically different depending on how often someone tends to have an incident. For some, diapers and pull-ups remain a nightly routine. \u201cI know when I go to sleep that I will wake up wet,\u201d says Sam. \u201cWhen my brain goes to sleep, everything else goes to sleep.\u201d Others end up playing a sort of Russian roulette with their own bodies, wondering if it\u2019s worth the effort and cost of wearing protection each night just to catch a dozen or so wet mornings each year. For these people, waterproof mattress protectors are a popular solution. Sam felt like he\u2019d just finally made peace with his nighttime routine when he began to experience daytime incontinence three years ago, at age 26. Developing daytime incontinence is a small but present risk for those with very frequent PNE, and can indicate a more bladder-specific origin for both issues. The change was devastating to the self-esteem he\u2019d worked hard to regain\u2014in large part because it meant he had to begin wearing disposable underwear-style pull-ups to work. \u201cHaving those issues in the day just brought back all the negativity,\u201d he says. After being out all day in pull-ups, \u201cwhen you get ready for bed and you change out of that into a nappy, you just feel pathetic. Really, really pathetic.\u201d The primary social challenge that adult bedwetters face is simply that incontinence, in all forms, is seen by many as exclusively juvenile\u2014and it all comes back to the diaper. \u201cPeople hate that word,\u201d says Bob. \u201cWe have all kinds of euphemisms for it.\u201d There\u2019s the less weighty \u201cnappy,\u201d from Sam\u2019s side of the pond, and the sterile adjectives \u201cdisposable\u201d or \u201creusable\u201d are used sometimes on forums in place of the item itself. Many incontinence websites that sell the products for adults call them just \u201cunderwear,\u201d with photos and packaging doing most of the work of differentiation. There is simply no way, bedwetters say, to put on a diaper without feeling infantilized, embarrassed even when there\u2019s nobody else in the room. The market for adult diapers and pull-ups is mostly aimed at the also-belittled geriatric population, and those that look more stylish or are marketed in more dignified ways are often prohibitively expensive for someone who needs them regularly. Even basic diapers bought in bulk come out to around a dollar apiece. Some people who wear them during waking hours easily go through three or more a day. Pull-ups are generally considered to be a bit more emotionally tolerable than bulkier traditional diapers with adhesive tabs, but don\u2019t always provide the tight seal that some people require. Any bedwetter can tell you where the humiliation they associate with diapers comes from. It\u2019s in the way we toilet train children. And nearly everyone cites the exact same phrase: \u201cBabies wear diapers.\u201d \u201cWe shame children out of them,\u201d says Sam. We appeal to childrens\u2019 desires to grow up, to grow out of diapers. We ask them, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be a baby, do you?\u201d Wearing a diaper can mean not only feeling like a baby, but being treated like one, too. This applies to almost anyone who struggles with any form of incontinence at any age. Among the elderly, more so than other consequences of aging, losing the ability to \u201chold it in\u201d is a one-way ticket to infantilization. It\u2019s a violation of the adult contract. Sam feels hurt when he hears bedwetting associated with childlike qualities like immaturity and laziness. \u201cI feel simultaneously too old for this and too young for this at the same time,\u201d says Sam. \u201cI\u2019m 29\u2014I\u2019m meant to be in my prime.\u201d",

        "content": "You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking only one movie is coming out this year. It\u2019s Barbie\u2019s world, and we\u2019re just living in it. Perhaps we should have anticipated the Barbie craze. After all, more than a billion dolls have been sold worldwide since Barbie\u2019s debut in 1959. Barbie is 64 years old, and yet this is the first time she\u2019ll star in a live-action movie on the big screen. A Barbie movie has been in the works since at least 2009, but versions with stars like Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer stalled in part because Mattel was nervous about attaching a face and a personality to the doll. Barbie has no inner life on purpose; children are supposed to project their hopes and dreams onto her blank canvas. Now, director Greta Gerwig is finally bringing not just one but several Barbies to the big screen\u2014many of whom are featured on a recent cover of this magazine. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about how the Barbie movie came to be and the frenzy around its opening, from the star-studded soundtrack to Margot Robbie\u2019s red carpet looks to how the movie\u2019s rivalry with Oppenheimer came to dominate social media. \u2014Eliana Dockterman The marketing may be inescapable, but Warner Bros. has done a good job of keeping the plot of Barbie under wraps. We\u2019ve seen the movie, and here\u2019s what we can reveal: The film is set in Barbie Land, a utopia where each Barbie has an equally impressive job, ranging from diplomat to scientist to Supreme Court Justice. As Helen Mirren\u2019s narrator wryly tells us, \u201call problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved.\u201d The Barbies have sleepovers every night during which they declare how beautiful and confident they feel. The Kens exist as convenient dance partners. But then Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie begins to think about mortality. Looking for answers, she ventures into the real world with Ryan Gosling\u2019s Ken, who has been feeling like a mere accessory in Barbie\u2019s dream life. The real world is, well, real. Men in suits at Mattel\u2014led by Will Ferrell\u2019s CEO\u2014make disingenuous speeches about female empowerment; tweens dress Barbie down for wreaking havoc on their self-esteem. Both Barbie and Ken go on quests of self-discovery, and that\u2019s when things get really interesting. The movie doesn\u2019t stick to a single genre: Somehow Barbie is a satire of a toy company\u2019s capitalist ambitions, a searing indictment of the current fraught state of gender relations, a heartwarming if occasionally clich\u00e9d tribute to girl power, and a musical spectacle filled with earworms from Nicki Minaj and Dua Lipa. And then some. \u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here Along with a relentless press tour that has seen Barbies and Kens\u2014or at least the actors playing them\u2014grace the cover of seemingly every magazine (including ours), this summer has also played host to a blitz of Barbie merchandising. Warner Bros. and Mattel have partnered with everyone from Bloomingdales to Pinkberry to roll out pink products. The fashion and makeup collaborations were perhaps to be expected. But Barbie pasta? A Barbie XBox? Barbie and Ken popping up on the Bumble dating app? The scale of this marketing campaign may be unprecedented. Still, the real reason that predictions for Barbie\u2019s box office have nearly doubled in the last few weeks may have less to do with the fact that you can\u2019t cross a street in a major city without spotting a Barbie ad and more to do with the fact that that ad is pink. Barbie is unapologetically leaning into the feminine aesthetic and courting a female audience\u2014still a rarity in Hollywood. Big budget movies, including Barbie\u2019s rivals at the box office, Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible, tend to be marketed toward a male audience. But, as Gerwig told TIME in her interview for our cover story, the movie was always going to be at its heart a mother-daughter film. Just about every woman has played with Barbie at some point in her life and has an opinion on the doll, whether they love her or hate her. As the Barbie trailer says, \u201cIf you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.\u201d \u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here Fans of Gerwig were probably surprised when she signed on to Barbie. What was the writer-director of Lady Bird and Little Women doing filming what could easily turn into a Mattel commercial? But Gerwig told TIME that she was a huge fan of dolls as a kid\u2014she was still playing with them in junior high: \u201cKids were drinking, and I was playing with dolls.\u201d And she stuffed the film full of ideas\u2014about capitalism, the patriarchy, religion, 1950s Hollywood musicals, and Sylvester Stallone\u2019s sartorial choices, to name just a few. The folks at Mattel have been notoriously protective of Barbie\u2019s image over the years, and the head of Mattel Films, Robbie Brenner, told the toy company executives they would have to \u201cwhite knuckle\u201d it through the creative process as Gerwig and producer-star Robbie pushed the limits on how much they could poke fun of the iconic and controversial doll. That led to occasional clashes, including a moment when Mattel President Richard Dickson flew to London to argue with Gerwig and Robbie over a particular scene. Dickson told TIME they changed his mind by performing the scene for him. The resulting film is a mashup of something both uniquely Gerwig, filled with all her quirks, and a project of corporate ambition to sell more dolls. \u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here Though the marketing push surrounding Barbie has been groundbreaking, ubiquitous, and very, very pink, the most memorable part of the film\u2019s promotionmay be the red carpet (ahem, pink carpet) looks sported by star Margot Robbie, who\u2019s taken inspiration from iconic looks worn by the doll over the years. While it could have been easy for Robbie to simply rely on the ultra-pink Barbiecore trend for the film\u2019s press tour, she and stylist Andrew Mukamal instead turned to the style archives of the world\u2019s most famous doll. From the signature black and white swimsuit and peep toe stiletto mules sported by the first Barbie doll in 1959 to the glamorous glittering black cocktail sheath with matching opera gloves worn by the \u201cSolo in the Spotlight\u201d doll that debuted in 1960, Robbie and Mukamal have found a way to not only channel, but also playfully reinterpret Barbie\u2019s most iconic looks through high fashion collaborations with brands like Schiaparelli, Moschino, and Vivienne Westwood. With her Barbie homages, Robbie isn\u2019t just delivering exquisite looks or compelling marketing for Mattel\u2014she\u2019s also setting a new and incredibly high bar for what the future of the red carpet looks like. Here\u2019s to a new (and far more playful) era of film promotion. \u2014Cady Lang Read the full story here There\u2019s been plenty of buzz around Barbie\u2019s star-studded soundtrack. Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Charli XCX, and Karol G are just a few of the high-profile artists featured on the album, which is executive produced by the superproducer Mark Ronson. In an interview, Mark Ronson describes what it was like making the album, finding the right collaborators, and jumping on the opportunity to work with Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. \u201cThose two make some of my favorite films,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, \u2018Even if I don\u2019t get this gig, I know this is going to be my favorite movie next year.\u2019\u201d So he signed on to do the project, and he and Gerwig hit the ground running: \u201cI became the Robin to her Batman,\u201d he says. And after weeks of teasing, Ronson finally revealed that Billie Eilish\u2014who the producer told TIME was \u201cone of the f-cking greatest living artists around\u201d\u2014had contributed a song called \u201cWhat Was I Made For?\u201d\u2014Moises Mendez II Read the full story here The movie\u2019s trailer makes the case that Barbie is everything and her male companion is \u201cjust Ken.\u201d But it\u2019s clear from the film\u2019s press tour that Ryan Gosling is far more than just Barbie\u2019s main squeeze. Throughout the film\u2019s promotion, Gosling has been anything but plastic\u2014delivering endless charm to journalists and fans alike by talking about how to channel your \u201cKenergy,\u201d sporting numerous dapper pastel suits, extolling the virtues of director Greta Gerwig (and even wearing a shirt with her name on it), and praising his wife Eva Mendes and their two daughters. While he might not be the titular star of Barbie, Gosling has proven he\u2019s a major player\u2014and a joy and delight\u2014when it comes to generating buzz around the film. \u2014Cady Lang Read the full story here What happens when two of the most anticipated films of 2023 debut in the same week? A fan-made movie crossover event known as Barbenheimer. Barbie will be released on July 21, and so will Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan\u2019s film about the development of the atomic bomb. Summer movie-goers are relishing the chance to celebrate a one-day cinematic experience of watching two polar-opposite films back-to-back. According to Elizabeth Frank, AMC\u2019s CCO and executive VP of worldwide programming, over 20,000 tickets have been sold so far at AMC Theaters to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day. The filmmakers and actors from both films are in on the fun, playfully leaning into the crowded film lineup to encourage more people to the movies. Gerwig and Robbie joined in, buying tickets to Oppenheimer, as well as the new Mission Impossible and Indiana Jones movies. Both Nolan and leading man Cillian Murphy of Oppenheimer have addressed the frenzy, with Nolan telling IGN, \u201cI think for those of us who care about movies, we\u2019ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it\u2019s here and that\u2019s terrific.\u201d \u2014Mariah Espada Read the full story here Barbie has landed in hot water in some parts of the world for a seemingly innocuous scene featuring a map that critics have alleged depicts the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d\u2014a maritime border that, although rejected by an international tribunal at The Hague, has been used by China to assert ownership of practically all of the South China Sea. Vietnam authorities banned the movie from being released in the country over the map, which Warner Bros. has said was meant simply to be a \u201cwhimsical, child-like crayon drawing\u201d and was \u201cnot intended to make any type of statement.\u201d The Philippines, another country that disputes China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea, approved Barbie for release\u2014justifying the decision in part by the fact that the line in question has only eight dashes\u2014but requested the map scene be blurred to prevent further misinterpretation. It\u2019s not clear what exactly eight dashes jutting out the side of a misshapen Asia continent are supposed to represent, but it\u2019s not the first time that this issue has caused controversy in the region, raising questions about the relationship between Hollywood and Beijing\u2014and the extent some studios will go to appease China for access to its massive market.\u2014Chad de Guzman Read the full story here There are so many references and easter eggs in Barbie it would take multiple viewings to catch every one. The movie isn\u2019t a musical, exactly, but it does have several song-and-dance numbers inspired by the soundstage musicals of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, particularly Gene Kelly films like An American in Paris and Singin\u2019 in the Rain. But Gerwig also drew inspiration from much more contemporary films, and references to movies like The Matrix, Clueless, and even Zack Snyder\u2019s cut of the Justice League find their way into the movie. And Gerwig didn\u2019t stop at studying film. She also extended our interview for the Barbie cover story just to tell me that specific shots in the film were modeled on Michaelangelo\u2019s Creation of Man, which adorns the Sistine Chapel. Like I said, there\u2019s a lot going on in this movie. \u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here Before there was Barbie, girls mostly played with baby dolls designed to train them to be nurturing mothers. Barbie, dreamt up by Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler, was the first \u201cfashion doll\u201d who had the body and stature of an adult woman. Girls could project their future selves onto the doll rather than care for her. Eventually, they could dress her up to be a doctor, an astronaut, or even president of the United States. Handler named the doll after her daughter Barbara, a tidbit that led Greta Gerwig to ground Barbie in a mother-daughter story. But Handler was a complicated woman who, as the Barbie film alludes to, was pursued by the IRS. In the movie she\u2019s a god-like figure, even if a flawed one. \u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here Barbie outperformed even the most optimistic prognosticator\u2019s predictions about the movie: The movie earned $337 million worldwide its opening weekend, the biggest debut of 2023 so far and the largest box office victory for a female director in the history of film. Though it initially seemed like Barbie and Oppenheimer might cannibalize one another at the box office, it turns out that Barbie buoyed the World War II era biopic: According to a poll by The Quorum, 6% of people who saw Oppenheimer did so because Barbie was sold out. Together, they set a post-pandemic record at the box office. Not since Avengers: Endgame premiered in 2019 have so many people flocked to movie theaters. Studios are already scrambling to find lessons about how future films might coax audiences away from streaming services and back to the cinema.\u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here",

        "title": "How 2024 Longshot Candidates Are Using Podcasts",
        "content": "If you follow politics on social media, video clips of long-shot 2024 presidential candidates have likely been all over your feeds recently, sitting in studios or offices with podcast microphones pressed to their faces. In recent months, Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Republican Vivek Ramaswamy have embarked on a podcast blitz, using their campaigns as calling cards for any show that will have them on\u2014from obscure history, wellness or crypto podcasts to Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter Spaces and Joe Rogan\u2019s popular program. It\u2019s an approach driven by necessity: television networks and media outlets tend to give long-shots little airtime or attention compared to the leading candidates. But as Kennedy and Ramaswamy have recognized, hundreds of podcasts and livestreams are happy to offer fringe contenders the opportunity to expound on their views for hours, usually without being challenged or fact-checked. Video clips of the exchanges are then widely disseminated across social platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Twitter, reaching bigger audiences than many traditional media outlets. Read More: Inside the Very Online Campaign of RFK Jr. It\u2019s a test run of a new kind of strategy for the social-media era: make yourself impossible to ignore by flooding the online ecosystem with appearances on alternate platforms. The resulting headlines often inflate the candidates\u2019 importance or support, and could ultimately become a headache for President Joe Biden or the Republican frontrunners. These kinds of candidates have \u201cfigured out a style of weaponized contrarianism that garners a lot of engagement,\u201d says Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab. \u201cIt\u2019s this \u2018vibes only\u2019 approach to mass media.\u201d For Kennedy, podcasts and alternative platforms offer a chance to speak to large audiences after more than 15 years of being relegated to the fringes for his anti-vaccine activism. Now, the views that once got him banned from social media for violating disinformation policies are being widely circulated on the same platforms through clips of his podcast appearances. \u201cOur strategy is not complex or targeted\u2026[but] we\u2019re getting a lot of traction,\u201d Kennedy told TIME in an interview in June, explaining that he views podcasts as a medium he can use to his advantage the same way his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, used television in the 1960s. \u201cIt\u2019s just about telling the truth to people and listening to what they say\u2026and big groups of people are listening. So that\u2019s nice.\u201d After appearing on Rogan\u2019s massively popular podcast on June 15, Kennedy\u2019s 2021 book The Real Anthony Fauci\u2014in which he accuses the top U.S. infectious-disease doctor of orchestrating \u201ca historic coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Western democracy\u201d\u2014shot up to become the #10 best-selling book on Amazon, his publisher says. It has sold more than 100,000 copies since he announced his presidential run. \u201cI\u2019m not attracted at all to soundbite politics,\u201d Kennedy explained in a June 8 interview with TIME. \u201cI\u2019m better at kind of explaining the complexities of issues, so I think [podcasts] are a much better medium for me. And the weird thing about it is that people are listening, particularly young people.\u201d For Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old biotech entrepreneur, the attention podcasts can bring has helped build name recognition and a larger online following. Previously little-known to most Republican voters, Ramaswamy announced in April that he was launching a daily podcast called \u201cThe Vivek Show,\u201d to \u201cpull back the curtain on the political process.\u201d It\u2019s reportedly part of a $10 million investment in media production that he plans to continue even if he drops his presidential bid, which is built on a promise to take the America First agenda \u201cfurther than Trump.\u201d Since that rollout, Ramaswamy has posted 55 episodes\u2013an average of one episode every day and a half. He\u2019s interviewed a host of conservative personalities, including former Attorney General Bill Barr and former NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch. In the meantime, he has gone on more than 70 podcasts himself, delivering polished, video-clip-friendly talking points to conservative commentators like Dan Bongino and Jordan Peterson as well as appearing on shows like \u201cRetirement Talk\u201d and \u201cAlmost 30,\u201d a women\u2019s wellness podcast. Read More: Why Vivek Ramaswamy is Defending Trump More Forcefully Than Other 2024 Contenders. The medium comes with a significant audience. Despite an increasingly saturated market, podcasts have continued to grow in popularity over the last decade. As of 2023, 42% of Americans over the age of 12 listen to at least one podcast per month, according to Edison Research, up from 12% in 2013. Political podcasts in particular have taken off, with everyone from Trump adviser Steve Bannon to former Obama strategist David Axelrod and Sen. Ted Cruz hosting regular conversations which are increasingly filmed and distributed as short clips. In right-wing media, these podcasts and online shows seem to have stepped into the role of conservative talk radio, creating popular commentators like Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino. The podcast strategy won\u2019t necessarily translate into votes. Ramaswamy is currently averaging 3% in polling nationally. While Kennedy started off polling around 20% with Democrats largely due to his name ID, analysts predict his track record of espousing conspiracies and increasingly close ties to right-wing personalities ultimately won\u2019t fly with party voters\u2014in one June poll, his net favorability among Democrats had fallen from 18% to 7%, while it jumped to 29% among Republicans. But to these candidates, the polls may not be the point. What matters is the exposure the medium provides\u2014and the fact they will continue to get more of it if they, and the people they\u2019re speaking to, are very loud and very online. \u201cThis is the first time there\u2019s someone actually speaking my language,\u201d says Justin Rezvani, a 34-year-old social media entrepreneur and Kennedy supporter who says he has never voted in a presidential election before but likes the candidate\u2019s views on cryptocurrency and censorship. \u201cIt\u2019s my personal belief that the 2024 election will not be determined by mainstream media approach\u2026but will be built upon this decentralized podcast and creator network that distributes the message.\u201d",

        "title": "Bereavement Camps Help Kids Affected by Suicide Grieve",
        "content": "One by one, children toss notecards into the flames, each one bearing the name of a loved one lost to suicide: fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters. Each card makes the fire burn a little brighter, a burst of light and memory as the paper singes and crumples. When each child has had their turn, they embrace in a group hug\u2014some crying, some smiling, together in both grief and healing. Tomorrow, the 72 children, teens, and young adults attending Comfort Zone Camp\u2019s three-day suicide-bereavement camp in rural New Jersey, as well as the parents who accompanied them and the \u201cbig buddies\u201d with whom the kids are paired, will pack up and return home. The hope is they\u2019ll leave feeling emotionally lighter than when they arrived, says Lynne Hughes, who founded Comfort Zone Camp more than 20 years ago to give grieving children a place to open up and heal from their losses. \u201cIf you never tell your story, grief doesn\u2019t go anywhere; it just hangs out on your shoulder with you,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cIf you tell your story, it de-powers it. You\u2019re going toward it. Mourning is the intentional act of going toward the grief.\u201d Hughes didn\u2019t start her organization specifically to help people dealing with suicide loss; it also offers free bereavement camps for kids who have lost loved ones to any cause. But the need for suicide-specific support has grown at both Comfort Zone Camp and in the wider network of U.S. bereavement camps in recent years. Attendance at Comfort Zone Camp\u2019s suicide-bereavement camp rose by about 50% from 2022 to 2023. That growing demand coincides with rising U.S. suicide rates, which increased by about 37% from 2000 to 2021. Almost 50,000 people in the U.S. died by suicide in 2021, leaving behind a devastating multiple of grieving loved ones\u2014many of them children. The bereavement-support organization Judi\u2019s House estimates that more than 450,000 U.S. children will lose a parent to suicide by the time they turn 18. Short sleepaway camps have emerged as a unique way to support children and families grieving these losses. Out in the woods, campers can tell their stories, bond with people who understand their pain, and feel like kids again through activities like boating, crafts, archery, and roasting marshmallows. \u201cYou make lifelong friendships at camp because you meet somebody that doesn\u2019t exactly know what you\u2019re going through, but they\u2019ve been through it in a different way,\u201d says Tess Wenger, 15, who started attending Comfort Zone Camp after her then-11-year-old sister died by suicide. \u201cYou feel as though you can talk to somebody about it and you won\u2019t feel judged like in the \u2018normal,\u2019 outside world.\u201d Some people who balk at traditional talk therapy find it easier to open up during activities like nature walks, yoga classes, and bonfires\u2014particularly with the knowledge that they\u2019re around people who intimately understand what they\u2019re going through, says Kaitlin Daeges, volunteer executive director at the Livin Foundation, which established a suicide-bereavement camp in Minnesota in 2019. Bereavement camps, which tend to be free, may also be more accessible than traditional mental-health care. Bridie Croucher struggled to find a therapist with immediate availability for her 10-year-old son, Oscar, after he started asking questions about his father\u2019s death by suicide, which happened when the boy was two-and-a-half. Facing a six-month-long waitlist for care, she enrolled him in Comfort Zone\u2019s suicide-loss camp \u201cto help bridge that gap,\u201d and says she\u2019s since noticed a huge difference in his ability to process and cope with his feelings. Sydney, Morgan, and Isaiah Mosher know first-hand how important it is to offer kids a place to heal when they need one. Their father died by suicide when they were teenagers. The family barely talked about their loss, Sydney says, which only prolonged the pain\u2014so as adults, she and her siblings decided to open Camp Kita, a free suicide-bereavement camp in Maine. Camp Kita hosted five campers in its first season 10 years ago; this year, it had to cap enrollment at 75 and limit the waitlist. Demand is so high that the founders are raising money to construct permanent campgrounds. They hope to offer year-round programming, including multiple camp sessions; retreats for groups at increased risk of suicide, such as veteran families and LGBTQ+ youth; mental-health trainings; nature-therapy programs; and more. Daeges, whose father died by suicide when she was 12, says rising demand for these services underscores their dual purposes: to serve families who are already part of the \u201cunfortunate club\u201d of suicide bereavement, and to prevent others from joining it. \u201cCamp is both reactive and preventive at the same time,\u201d Daeges says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to support these families and the people left behind\u2026so they don\u2019t get to the same place.\u201d Camps can also help address the \u201cunique nuances\u201d of suicide grief, Hughes says. Loved ones often blame themselves, feeling as though they could have intervened if they\u2019d picked up on certain clues or been in the right place at the right time. They may also have experienced specific traumas, like finding their loved one\u2019s body or reading a suicide note they left behind. Many people who die by suicide have also previously dealt with substance use and mental-health disorders, which can impact the memories their loved ones carry. Research shows that people are at greater risk of suicidal behavior after someone they know dies by suicide. Children who lose a parent to suicide are also susceptible to developing suicidal behavior and psychiatric disorders, research suggests. Although far more adults than children die by suicide, rates of mental distress and suicidal thinking are on the rise among young people. As of 2021, more than 40% of high school students said they felt sad or hopeless; 30% of teen girls and 14% of teen boys had seriously considered suicide; and 13% of teen girls and 7% of teen boys had attempted suicide, federal data show. Given those alarming statistics, it\u2019s particularly important to support young people who may be at increased risk of self-harm or suicide, such as those who have experienced the death of a parent, sibling, or friend. Suicide bereavement isn\u2019t like other types of grief. It\u2019s a form of \u201cdisenfranchised grief,\u201d or grief that, due to social stigma, \u201cis not fully embraced and welcomed by society,\u201d says Sarah Behm, who works with the Eluna Network, a nonprofit that supports grieving children and families and runs Camp Erin, a nationwide network of bereavement camps. This stigma can make it difficult for people to openly grieve those they lost, often causing them to draw inward instead. Bereavement camps create safe spaces where people can freely discuss their losses without judgment, Behm says. That power is on full display at Comfort Zone Camp, where campers share their stories in age-group-specific \u201chealing circles\u201d to counter the hushed tones with which people usually talk about suicide, Hughes says. To start the circle, campers exchange pins to recognize what they appreciate and respect about one another. Then, campers volunteer to tell their stories. Passing around a stress ball to mark whose turn it is to share, some campers speak eloquently\u2014it\u2019s clear they\u2019ve told their stories before\u2014while others stammer as they describe difficult details aloud for the first time. Their peers listen quietly, then ask questions about their grief journey and the deceased. Who were they as a person? What was their favorite color? What\u2019s your favorite memory with them? Is there anything special you do on their death date? What brings you comfort when you\u2019re feeling sad? The answers aren\u2019t just healing for the speaker; sharing these lived experiences exposes everyone in the circle to new coping mechanisms. \u201cYou can talk without any fears\u201d in these healing circles, says 16-year-old Malachi Chass\u00e9, who attends Comfort Zone Camp to help cope with his father\u2019s death by suicide and his baby brother\u2019s accidental death. \u201cYou can share. Everyone\u2019s going to understand.\u201d Even outside healing circles, during activities that are ostensibly just for fun, there is an undercurrent of community and healing. As campers clamber through an obstacle course, Hughes asks how the experience is like grief. \u201cSome sections take longer than others,\u201d replies one camper. \u201cYou get down,\u201d adds another, \u201cand get back up.\u201d If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental-health crisis or contemplating suicide, call or text 988. In emergencies, call 911, or seek care from a local hospital or mental health provider.",

        "title": "U.S. has a New Operating Nuclear Power Reactor",
        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A new reactor at a nuclear power plant in Georgia has entered commercial operation, becoming the first new American reactor built from scratch in decades. Georgia Power Co. announced Monday that Unit 3 at Plant Vogtle, southeast of Augusta, has completed testing and is now sending power to the grid reliably. At its full output of 1,100 megawatts of electricity, Unit 3 can power 500,000 homes and businesses. Utilities in Georgia, Florida and Alabama are receiving the electricity. Nuclear power now makes up about 25% of the generation of Georgia Power, the largest unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. A fourth reactor is also nearing completion at the site, where two earlier reactors have been generating electricity for decades. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Friday said radioactive fuel could be loaded into Unit 4, a step expected to take place before the end of September. Unit 4 is scheduled to enter commercial operation by March. The third and fourth reactors were originally supposed to cost $14 billion, but are now on track to cost their owners $31 billion. That doesn\u2019t include $3.7 billion that original contractor Westinghouse paid to the owners to walk away from the project. That brings total spending to almost $35 billion. The third reactor was supposed to start generating power in 2016 when construction began in 2009. Vogtle is important because government officials and some utilities are again looking to nuclear power to alleviate climate change by generating electricity without burning natural gas, coal and oil. \u201cThis project shows just how new nuclear can and will play a critical role in achieving a clean energy future for the United States,\u201d Southern Co. CEO Chris Womack said in a statement. \u201cBringing this unit safely into service is a credit to the hard work and dedication of our teams at Southern Company and the thousands of additional workers who have helped build that future at this site.\u201d In Georgia, almost every electric customer will pay for Vogtle. Georgia Power currently owns 45.7% of the reactors. Smaller shares are owned by Oglethorpe Power Corp., which provides electricity to member-owned cooperatives, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Oglethorpe and MEAG plan to sell power to cooperatives and municipal utilities across Georgia, as well in Jacksonville, Florida, and parts of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Georgia Power\u2019s 2.7 million customers are already paying part of the financing cost and elected public service commissioners have approved a monthly rate increase of $3.78 a month for residential customers as soon as the third unit begins generating power. That could hit bills in August, two months after residential customers saw a $16-a-month increase to pay for higher fuel costs. Commissioners will decide later who pays for the remainder of the costs of Vogtle, including the fourth reactor.",

        "title": "Life Expectancy Proves How Far Black Americans Have Come",
        "content": "In August 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that over the last two years, Black Americans\u2019 life expectancy declined to about 71 years old, six years lower than their white counterparts. National disparities in life expectancy can represent the permanency of racism, offering little reason for hope. But in Manassas Park, Va. and Weld County, Colo., the mean-life expectancy for Black residents is 96\u2014a national high among all Black citizens by county. Black people are living in their 80s in larger Democratic jurisdictions like Montgomery County, Maryland and smaller Republican districts like Collier County, Florida. My colleague Jonathan Rothwell and I reported hundreds of places that exceed commonly held expectations in Brookings\u2019s recently released Black Progress Index, an interactive tool and report developed in partnership with the NAACP that provides a means to understand the health and well-being of Black people and the conditions that shape their lives. Instead of comparing Black people to white people, we examine life expectancy differences among the Black population in different places. This method reveals the locales where Black people are thriving. Researchers often sloppily compare rates of home ownership, educational attainment, income and mortality without attending to past and present discrimination that intended to create disparities. Consequently, broad national averages void of context policy and local contexts camouflage the very real progress that\u2019s occurring across the country. Still, in places like Jefferson County, Ohio, the average Black person lives 33 fewer years than Manassas Park, Va. and Weld County, Colo. That gap is roughly equivalent to 100 years of progress in living standards, medical science, and public health. Black people are not a monolith. They have widely different outcomes in very different places. Local contexts matter as Black people do. Lower life expectancy in counties and metro areas across the country suggests that people are losing battles against racism. But geographic areas where Black people are thriving offer more than hope: People\u2019s civic actions are delivering positive change. Read More: Why John Lewis Kept Telling the Story of Civil Rights, Even Though It Hurt What accounts for such vast differences? Life expectancy, a cumulative measure of health and well-being, summarizes both the biological and non-biological influences on our lives.\u202fBecause race is a sociological construct and not a biological one, we should assume disparities in life expectancy represent differences in non-biological influences on our lives. Our current life expectancy data suggest that people are breaking down specific social conditions that influence longevity, giving real reason for optimism. Using a common machine-learning algorithm to select variables and rank their importance, the Index identifies 13 social conditions that predict Black life expectancy.\u202fMany are those one might expect, such as income, education, housing, and family composition. Others were more surprising, including the top predictor of high Black life expectancy: larger shares of foreign-born Black residents. One standard deviation above the mean in this variable adds one year to predicted life Black expectancy. For instance, Brooklyn, N.Y. is in the 89th percentile of life expectancy at 78.5. The more than 43% of Black residents of King\u2019s County who are immigrants, places it in the 98th percentile among all counties. The cause for this interpretation is unclear; it may be a pure composition effect, in that foreign-born Black Americans enjoy better health than the native Black population. Though, this data points to a larger question: Is less exposure to U.S. racism good for your health? On the other end of the spectrum, a surprising predictor of low Black life expectancy is religious membership. Keeping in mind all the social determinants that showed to be significant in our study are correlational, not causal. Revoking a church membership will not automatically add years to a person\u2019s life. The challenge is understanding why religious adherence is associated with lower life expectancy. Church goers are more likely to be obese and, on the surface, asking \u201cJesus to take the wheel\u201d may negate any agency we have in influencing our health outcome. We also know that place-based bias that comes out of the wash of housing devaluation hurts the families and institutions, including churches, in those locales. More research is needed to uncover the conditions and behaviors underlying all the variables that strongly influence life expectancy. The fact that we realize progress and stagnation in Black life expectancy in different places makes clear that people have agency. The gains and losses reflect that. When we take an overly optimistic or pessimistic view of the state of Black America and treat Black people as a monolith, we don\u2019t see localized stories of growth, determination, and thriving. The diversity of places where Black people are thriving suggests that it has something to do with Black people themselves. In places like Montgomery County, Md., individuals, civil rights groups, organizers, and politicians are dismantling the architecture of inequality that takes away years of life. That said, we still need to examine and throw away the overly optimistic position on race relations\u2014that the country has moved beyond slavery, Jim Crow racism, and the array of discriminatory policies and their long-term effects. People who hold this perspective contend that America is a level playing field and that with effort, Black people can achieve anything a white person can. But locales that post life expectancies under 70 perform poorly on environment or institutional indicators like the air and school quality, suggesting that life is harder in some places due to systemically racist forces. In Lowndes County, Ala. where Montgomery is the county seat, Black life expectancy is 68.5. In Greenwood, Miss., it\u2019s 67.3. In Salem, Ore., life expectancy is 64.4. It\u2019s also worth speculating on seemingly obvious reason why some cities, like Jackson, Miss., don\u2019t post higher rates than 72.6. Jackson has higher homeownership rates than most places (94th percentile) and a higher percentage business ownership (59th percentile). But the recent water crises show how local politics of Mississippi play out in lower investments in the city\u2019s water infrastructure, which plays out in other municipal services that impact life expectancy like education. \u201cSocial reforms move slowly,\u201d wrote W.E.B. Du Bois, suggesting that we must learn from our circumstances in ways that reject intemperance and blame. \u201c[W]hen Right is reinforced by calm but persistent Progress we\u202fsomehow all feel that in the end it must triumph.\u201d Society is toiling with the same struggles around racism that Du Bois faced at the turn of the 20th century. Nonetheless, we must take the time to recognize empirical signs of progress and not rush toward unsophisticated, untruthful narratives of hopelessness or blind ignorance that remove or dismiss our agency. A path of progress demands that we have a clear view of the social, political, and economic landscape in which we live. Recognizing progress and defeats will have us see the very real capacity for future change. The assumption\u2014backed with data\u2014that Black people in places with higher life expectancy had a hand in their outcomes should inspire us to seek change in places where discrimination is robbing people of years of life.",

        "title": "'Humbled for the opportunity': Country music star Craig Morgan re-enlists in the army",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Country music star Craig Morgan had decided to step away from the military after more than 17 years of service, including nearly a decade on active duty.   But fans in the historic halls of the Grand Ole Opry on Saturday night were in for an unprecedented surprise, when Morgan, 59, was sworn in as a warrant officer with the U.S. Army Reserves \u2014 becoming the first person to commission at the home of country music \u2014 Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cI feel like an 18-year-old kid, I can tell you,\u201d Morgan said in an interview with NBC News ahead of the ceremony. \u201cI\u2019m excited, nervous. But humbled. I\u2019m humbled for the opportunity.\u201d One year ago, after Morgan performed at a military fundraiser, he had told Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., that leaving the military early was his \u201cbiggest regret.\u201d \u201cAs a, you know, throwaway comment I said, \u2018I\u2019d love to finish my commitment \u2014 that\u2019s a 20-year commitment to our country, and I want to finish that,\u2019\u201d Morgan recalled of their conversation. Soon after, Blackburn\u2019s team connected Morgan with officials from the Department of Defense.  Amid projected shortfalls across several military branches, Morgan\u2019s personal ambitions fell secondary to the main reason he decided to serve again. \u201cI feel like if a guy like me, who has the career that I do, can go in and participate \u2026 anybody can do it,\u201d he said Friday while on a tour bus in Britt, Iowa. Morgan, who grew up poor, said the military opened doors for him: \u201cIf you join the military, you\u2019re going to be afforded opportunities and situations for you to enhance and grow your life that you can\u2019t get in the civilian populace.\u201d  The Army missed its recruiting goal of new recruits by 15,000 last year, and is on track to miss its goal by 10,000 this year, according to recent congressional testimony from Army Secretary Christine Wormuth. The Navy and Air Force also expect to fall short of their recruiting goals. The military has fallen victim to politicization in recent years, with some Republicans attributing \u201cfar-left woke\u201d policies \u2014 like once-mandatory Covid vaccinations, abortion access, and LGBTQ inclusivity \u2014 as a lynchpin for why recruitment is at a historic low. Wormuth rebuked those claims in June, telling MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d: \u201cWe are a ready Army, not a \u2018woke\u2019 Army.\u201d She also told reporters that the \u201cdrip, drip, drip of criticism about a woke military is having some counterproductive effects on recruiting.\u201d Previously a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Blackburn told NBC News on Friday that she believes young people do not have an \u201cemphasis on doing for others that there ought to be,\u201d adding: \u201cPeople who go into the military are selfless and they put others before themselves.\u201d Morgan echoed Blackburn\u2019s comments, but struggled to pinpoint an exact reason as to why the military is not able to attract sufficient recruits. \u201cBudgets are important. Military force buildup is important,\u201d he said.  \u201cI also think it has a lot to do with this right here,\u201d Morgan added, holding up his iPhone during the virtual interview. \u201cThey\u2019re great if used properly. But there\u2019s also something to be said about having to talk to someone, having to rely on someone, having to support someone.\u201d The Tennessee native \u2014 who tragically lost his son, Jerry, in a tubing accident in 2016 \u2014 said those who refuse to join the military due to political disagreements need to \u201cput all of that aside.\u201d \u201cI might not agree with everything this administration does, but I still go do my job and be all I can be so that I can be all I can be for everyone else,\u201d he said. In front of the American flag on stage where he swore in Morgan, commander of Army Forces Command, Gen. Andrew Poppas, said: \u201cEvery soldier who enters the Army has the opportunity to become the best version of themselves, and Staff Sgt. Morgan is no exception.\u201d  Poppas added that he looks \u201cforward to seeing what he [Morgan] accomplishes and how he impacts other soldiers around the Army.\u201d Morgan will be assigned to Redstone Arsenal in Alabama, where he will be stationed two days out of every month. The musician is currently on his God, Family Country tour across the country. \u201cHaven\u2019t sung in uniform in a long time,\u201d he said, performing his hit \"Soldier\" for the roaring crowd.",

        "content": "Fans of singer and songwriter Coco Lee, who was known for her powerful voice and live performances, were gathering with flowers to pay their respects to their idol at her funeral in Hong Kong on Monday. The evening services were expected to be attended by her family, friends and supporters. Lee died July 5 at age 48. She was born in Hong Kong and attended school in San Francisco before releasing her first album in 1994 at age 19. She began her career as a Mandopop singer but branched out to release albums in Cantonese and English. She was the first Chinese singer to break into the American market, and her English song \u201cDo You Want My Love\u201d climbed to #4 on Billboard\u2019s Hot Dance Breakouts chart in December 1999. In 2001, she sang \u201cA Love Before Time\u201d from Ang Lee\u2019s movie \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\u201d at the Academy Awards, becoming the first Chinese American to perform at the Oscars. Lee was also the voice of heroine Fa Mulan in the Mandarin version of Disney\u2019s \u201cMulan,\u201d and sang the Mandarin version of the movie\u2019s theme song \u201cReflection.\u201d Lee was married to Bruce Rockowitz, former CEO of Hong Kong supply chain company Li & Fung. She had two stepdaughters. Her death had shocked fans. Her siblings posted on Facebook that she had depression for years and had attempted suicide at home on July 2. She died a few days later. On Monday afternoon, more than 100 fans dressed in black were waiting outside the funeral home. Lin Jing, a fan from Fujian province in the southeast, said she admired Lee\u2019s smile and appearance, adding: \u201cShe was really talented. She always tried to improve and she inspired women to feel independent.\u201d In a video for her memorial service, actors and singers from Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan recalled their memories with Lee and mourned her death. Action star Jackie Chan said in the video that everyone was proud of her when she sang at the Oscars. \u201cTo friends like us, Coco was a passionate and kind friend who showed care to us. She was really a good person. That\u2019s why we are so reluctant to accept she has left us,\u201d he said. Award-winning director Ang Lee recalled his exchanges with the late singer before the Oscars and said it was a pity she died so young. \u201cWe miss her very much. Coco, rest in peace,\u201d he said in the video. In Coco Lee\u2019s recent social media posts, she kept spreading positivity. In March, she posted about having to relearn how to walk after undergoing surgery for an old leg injury. \u201cSuccessful surgery. Even though I\u2019m in a lot of pain and I have to re-learn how to walk again, I know I can do it,\u201d she wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cYes I can and I will!\u201d If you or someone you know is in crisis, call 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

        "title": "What does Ron DeSantis have riding on the debates? Maybe everything.",
        "content": "Ron DeSantis is weeks away from what could be the pivotal moment of his White House bid. Allies, donors and voters alike are looking at Aug. 23, the night of the first Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, as the event that could re-establish the Florida governor as a strong alternative to former President Donald Trump \u2014 or, if things go poorly, deliver a death blow to an already ailing campaign. \u201cThe debate is of vital importance for Gov. DeSantis,\u201d Dan Eberhart, a donor to the campaign, said. \u201cHe urgently needs to change the story arc and regain momentum.\u201d  While it\u2019s still early, the debate kickoff is traditionally a time when audiences begin to more broadly tune into the presidential primary.  DeSantis\u2019 campaign has taken a beating since his official launch in May. His performance has not met the early hype and high expectations that he was the GOP contender best positioned to beat Trump. His poll numbers remain stubbornly stagnant, a cash crunch looms and donors have grown restless. A recent bloodletting of campaign staff \u2014 more than 40% have been fired in recent weeks \u2014 has pushed DeSantis into a reset that has yet to show sharp improvements.  All of this adds exponentially more pressure as he prepares for a debate that the front-running Trump has hinted he may skip. Any notable missteps by DeSantis on that prime-time national stage could be difficult, if not impossible, to recover from, GOP observers say. \u201cIf he bombs, it\u2019s full-blown tail spin at that point,\u201d said Republican strategist Gregg Keller, who has worked on presidential campaigns dating to George W. Bush in 2004. \u201cYou do this long enough and you don\u2019t believe any early narrative. Yet I personally have become convinced that DeSantis has some very, very substantial problems.\u201d  DeSantis campaign allies say the national exposure will only strengthen the governor's position, giving him the opportunity to show off his intelligence and political record, among the attributes they say got him elected twice statewide in Florida.  \u201cObviously, debates are milestones in a campaign. Oftentimes, they are make or break in both directions for various campaigns,\u201d Ken Cuccinelli, founder of the pro-DeSantis Never Back Down super PAC told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in an interview last week. \u201cDonald Trump lost the first presidential debate to Joe Biden because he is a good showman, but he is not a good debater because it highlights his weaknesses. Whereas in Ron DeSantis\u2019 case, it showcases his preparation, his brainpower and his application of it all to the benefit of ordinary Americans\u2019 lives,\" he added. \"So I look very forward to his performance in those debates as a place to expand his forward-looking vision for America.\u201d   Several likely GOP caucusgoers in Iowa said in interviews this week that they believe DeSantis has squandered his early advantage as the highest-polling alternative to Trump. The debate, they said, is a potential opportunity for the governor to reverse his fortunes. \u201cI like him. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be able to go all the way,\u201d Alan Boelter, an undecided GOP voter from Clive said while waiting to hear South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott this week in Ankeny. \u201cIf he has a good first debate, he might actually rocket up a little bit higher.\u201d \u201cI like what he has to say,\u201d Morey Hill of Slater said at the same event. \u201cI\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t gotten more traction in the polls. I\u2019m just waiting to see if some movement can be gained.\u201d \u201cIf people will tune in and be engaged\u201d to the debate, Hill added, \u201cthey might get a better feel of what he\u2019s doing.\u201d This campaign, I think, really starts on the day of the debate. DESANTIS DONOR HAL LAMBERT Some say DeSantis had a strong performance at the Iowa GOP\u2019s Lincoln Dinner last week in Des Moines. But the governor\u2019s other events in the state that will hold the first Republican caucuses in January were marked by awkward moments and thin turnout. He also spent much of his time defending his stance on Florida 's controversial new educational standards on slavery.   \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely huge,\u201d New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican who opted against a presidential run but prefers to see the party nominate someone other than Trump, said of the first debate and its importance to a DeSantis comeback. Sununu spoke to NBC News in Des Moines after listening to DeSantis\u2019 speech, which he found impressive. \u201cIf he comes [to the debate] with the energy that he just brought here tonight, he\u2019s going to do very well,\u201d Sununu said. \u201cHe had the crowd. He didn\u2019t just have people interested, he had them excited. But that\u2019s kind of the formula they all need to find.\u201d DeSantis\u2019 struggles are all a far cry from late last year, when he was well funded, leading Trump in the polls and had already caught the attention of some of the country\u2019s top billionaires.  Some of those high-rollers, including Dick Uihlein and Ken Griffin, have pumped the brakes. Other donors have more than once agitated for a campaign shakeup.  Donors and allies have consistently said they need to see a signal that DeSantis is capable of righting the ship.   \u201cThis campaign, I think, really starts on the day of the debate,\u201d said Hal Lambert, a DeSantis donor. \u201cIf you want to talk about reset, I think the debates are what are going to cause that.\u201d  If Trump isn\u2019t there, Lambert said, \u201cDeSantis will be getting all the arrows launched at him. If Trump is there, DeSantis will still get all the arrows.\u201d  \u201cNo one needs a win on the debate stage more than Gov. DeSantis,\u201d said Bill Stepien, who managed Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign and now is not working for any campaign. \u201cBest-case scenario? He lays out the case for his candidacy in a way that he has failed to do thus far and reminds people that they once considered him to be the viable alternative to Donald Trump. Worst-case scenario? He continues his streak of failing to meet expectations and his campaign bleeding continues.\u201d  Mary Kate Carey, a onetime speechwriter for George H.W. Bush, said usually the first primary debate isn\u2019t a high stakes situation, but in DeSantis\u2019 case, it is. \u201cHe\u2019s under some pressure to put forth a positive, pro-growth agenda that is all about a transformative vision for moving the country forward in a positive way,\u201d she said.  Trump has said in public statements and private conversations that he does not intend to debate. But the former president has a penchant for unpredictability. Before an Iowa crowd this weekend, he openly pondered whether he should head to the debate stage. \u201cI probably, maybe won the presidency because of the debates, but at a certain point, you say, why are we doing these things? Why are we doing this thing? So we\u2019ll see what happens. I haven\u2019t made a commitment one way or the other,\u201d Trump said, then asked the crowd: \u201cShould I do them or not?\u201d DeSantis has challenged Trump to take to the debate stage, saying earlier this month on a talk radio show: \u201cNobody is entitled to this nomination ... Every candidate needs to be put to the test, and I think he needs to step up and do it.\" The super PAC backing DeSantis took the challenge up a notch. \"Gov. DeSantis has said he looks forward to debating to prove to voters he is the leader who will save our country. Nobody is entitled to the nomination, and everyone who qualified for the debate should respect the American people by showing up and debating the issues facing them,\" Never Back Down spokeswoman Jess Szymanski said. \"Donald Trump wants to hide just like Joe Biden, while Ron DeSantis never shies away from the tough fights. What is Trump afraid of?\" Beth Hansen, who managed former Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s 2016 campaign for the GOP presidential nomination, said she sees Scott and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 two relative newcomers on the national stage \u2014 with the most to gain from the first debate. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to be there and be seen as a top-tier candidate, someone who can potentially challenge for the nomination,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cYou want supporters to know the strength of your campaign.\u201d Conversely, Hansen said she viewed DeSantis more like the Scott Walker of the 2024 field. Walker, then the governor of Wisconsin, was an early favorite in the 2016 GOP primary but burned through money quickly, failed to surpass Trump in the polls and dropped out months before the Iowa caucuses. DeSantis, she added, should lean more into his record as a governor navigating hurricanes rather than nagging Disney. \u201cI think he has put himself in a little bit of a trick box,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cHe wanted to be the candidate most like Trump who wasn\u2019t Trump. If you\u2019re going to have a choice between Coca-Cola or RC Cola, you want the real one.\u201d Natasha Korecki reported from Chicago, Henry Gomez from Iowa, and Jonathan Allen from Washington, D.C.",

        "content": "Pakistan held funerals on Monday for victims of a massive suicide bombing that targeted a rally of a pro-Taliban cleric the previous day as the government vowed to hunt down those behind the attack. No one immediately claimed responsibility for Sunday\u2019s bombing, which killed at least 45 people and wounded nearly 100. Police said their initial investigation suggests the Islamic State group\u2019s regional affiliate could be behind the attack. The victims were all from the Jamiat Ulema Islam party, which is headed by hard-line cleric and politician Fazlur Rehman. He did not attend the rally, held under a large tent close to a market in Bajur, a district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that borders Afghanistan. The IS regional affiliate \u2014 known as the Islamic State in Khorasan Province \u2014 is based in neighboring Afghanistan\u2019s Nangarhar province and is a rival of the Afghan Taliban. Bajur was a stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban \u2014 a close ally of Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban government \u2014 before several Pakistani army offensives that ended in 2016 claimed to have driven them out of the area. The cleric\u2019s supporters had gathered in Bajut on Sunday as part of their party\u2019s preparations for the next parliamentary elections, expected sometime in October or November after the current parliament\u2019s five-year term ends. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to dissolve the parliament in August to pave the way for the vote. Rehman\u2019s party is part of Sharif\u2019s coalition government, which came to power in April 2022 by ousting former Prime Minister Imran Khan through a no-confidence vote in the legislature. Khan later on Sunday also condemned the bombing, as condolences continued to pour in from across the country. Dozens of people who received minor injuries were discharged from hospital while the critically wounded were taken to the city of Peshawar by army helicopters. Local police chief Akhtar Hayat Gandapur told NBC News on Monday that they have confirmed 43 deaths, with around 90 people injured and under treatment in different hospitals. Jalil Jan, a spokesperson for the Jamiat Ulema Islam political party, said earlier that the death toll was 55. Sharif called Rehman to express his condolences and assure the cleric that those who orchestrated the attack would be punished. The bombing has also drawn nationwide condemnation, with ruling and opposition parties offering condolences to the families of the victims. The U.S. and Russian embassies in Islamabad also condemned the attack. Abdul Rasheed, a senior leader in Rehman\u2019s party said the bombing was aimed at weakening the party but that \u201csuch attacks cannot deter our resolve.\u201d The Pakistani Taliban also distanced themselves from the attack. The outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, said the attack aimed to set Islamists against each other. Zabihullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Afghan Taliban, posted on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201csuch crimes cannot be justified in any way.\u201d The bombing came hours before the arrival of Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Islamabad, where on Monday he was to participate in an event to mark a decade of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a sprawling package under which Beijing has invested billions of dollars in Pakistan. In recent months, China has helped Pakistan avoid a default on sovereign payments. Some Chinese nationals have also been targeted by militants in northwestern Pakistan and elsewhere. Feroz Jamal, the provincial information minister, said police were \u201cinvestigating this attack in all aspects.\u201d Sunday\u2019s bombing was one of the four worst attacks in northwestern Pakistan since 2014, when 147 people, mostly schoolchildren, were killed in a Taliban attack on an army-run school in Peshawar. In January, 74 people were killed in a bombing at a mosque in Peshawar. And in February, more than 100 people, mostly policemen, died in a bombing at a mosque inside a high-security compound housing Peshawar police headquarters.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell suddenly stopped speaking during a weekly Republican leadership news conference Wednesday afternoon, appearing to freeze, and then went silent and was walked away. McConnell, R-Ky., had been making his opening remarks about an annual defense policy bill when he stopped talking. He was silent for 19 seconds. His Republican colleagues asked whether he was OK, and a top McConnell deputy, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, a physician, escorted McConnell, 81, away from the cameras and reporters. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa made a hand gesture that initially appeared to resemble the sign of the cross. Her office later clarified that she was motioning for Senate Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota. McConnell's freeze-up comes after he tripped and fell at the Washington, D.C., airport earlier this month, as first reported by NBC News Wednesday night. McConnell was not seriously injured in the incident. A few minutes later, McConnell walked back to the news conference by himself. Asked about his health, he said he was fine. Asked whether he is fully able to do his job, he said, \"Yeah.\" Asked about the episode, an aide pointed to McConnell\u2019s saying, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d but the aide added that McConnell \u201cfelt lightheaded and stepped away for a moment.\u201d \"He came back to handle Q&A, which as everyone observed was sharp,\" the aide said. McConnell spoke to reporters briefly Wednesday night as he left the Capitol and said, \"The president called to check on me.\" \"I told him I got sandbagged,\" he joked. A White House official and a spokesperson for the senator confirmed that President Joe Biden and McConnell spoke by phone Wednesday. Asked by reporters how he was feeling, McConnell said, \"I'm fine.\" He did not directly answer what happened earlier in the day or whether he saw a doctor. McConnell tripped and fell March 8 after an event for the Senate Leadership Fund \u2014 a Republican super PAC aligned with McConnell and GOP leadership \u2014 at the Waldorf Astoria in Washington. He was hospitalized with a concussion and a minor rib fracture and was discharged March 13 before he entered rehab. He didn't return to the Senate, however, until mid-April. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told NBC News on Wednesday that he met with McConnell after the Senate GOP leadership news conference for a regularly scheduled meeting \"to catch up on both houses.\" \"He was good,\" McCarthy said. \"There was no concerns about his health in the meeting.\" McConnell has served in the Senate since 1985. He isn't up for re-election until the 2026 midterm elections.",

        "content": "Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis reemphasized her plans to announce charging decisions by Sept. 1 in her investigation into efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. \u201cThe work is accomplished,\u201d Willis told an NBC affiliate during a back-to-school event last weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working for two-and-a-half years. We\u2019re ready to go.\u201d In a letter to the chief judge of the Fulton County courthouse in May, Willis signaled in a scheduling request that charging decisions stemming from an investigation into \u201cpossible criminal interference in the administration of Georgia\u2019s 2020 general election\u201d could come in early August. She asked the judge to not schedule in-person trials or hearings the weeks of Aug. 7 and 14. Willis also said in a separate letter to law enforcement that she\u2019d announce charging decisions during a state Superior Court term that began this month. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney seated two grand juries this month that will hear cases over the length of term, which ends Sept. 1. They are likely to be tasked with deciding whether Trump and his allies will face election interference charges. In the interview over the weekend, Willis said she is preparing for people\u2019s reactions to the charging decisions. \u201cSome people may not be happy with the decisions that I\u2019m making,\u201d Willis said. \u201cAnd sometimes, when people are unhappy, they act in a way that could create harm.\u201d  She also said part of the preparations include increased security, and she commended the Fulton County sheriff. \u201cI think that the sheriff is doing something smart in making sure that the courthouse stays safe,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to put any of the employees or the constituents that come to the courthouse in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Willis launched a sprawling investigation in early 2021 into whether Trump and his allies interfered in the battleground state\u2019s election process during the 2020 election  Willis called for a special grand jury last year because the panel had the power to issue subpoenas to force witnesses to testify. The jury, which was tasked with determining whether there were coordinated attempts to unlawfully change the results of the 2020 elections, recommended indicting more than a dozen people, its foreperson, Emily Kohrs, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News\u201d in February. The names have not been made public. \u201cThere are certainly names that you will recognize, yes. There are names also you might not recognize,\u201d Kohrs said at the time. At least eight of Georgia\u2019s \u201cfake electors\u201d \u2014 who signed a certificate falsely declaring that Trump had won Georgia in the 2020 election and declared themselves Georgia\u2019s \u201cduly elected and qualified\u201d electors \u2014 have been granted immunity in Willis\u2019 probe, court filings show. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the case and has accused Willis, a Democrat, of spearheading a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him. Willis\u2019 latest remarks comes after Georgia\u2019s Supreme Court denied Trump\u2019s attempt to disqualify her from the probe and to quash the special grand jury\u2019s report that recommends indictments.",

        "title": "GOP lawmaker 'screamed' curse words inches from Senate pages' faces, source says",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A freshman Republican lawmaker received bipartisan condemnation after he allegedly yelled at a group of high- school-age Senate pages for \u201cdefiling\u201d the Capitol on Wednesday. New details shared with NBC News paint an even more disturbing picture of what took place that night. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., told the teenagers to \u201cget the f--- out\u201d of the rotunda, according to one source who witnessed the interaction and spoke on condition of anonymity. The source described Van Orden's demeanor as \u201cphysically aggressive\u201d toward the pages. The lawmaker was \u201cscreaming inches from the pages\u2019 faces\u201d and \u201cshooed\u201d at them with his hands several times, said the source, who described previously unreported details of Van Orden\u2019s behavior. The summer pages are part of a prestigious Senate tradition that dates back to 1829, and were enjoying their last week on the job. After completing a long shift, a group of them decided to take advantage of a typically empty rotunda at that time of night to take in the Capitol sights.  Van Orden approached the group. He had been hosting a beer and cheese event with constituents as he often does, a spokesperson said, and a photo posted to Twitter by a reporter for Punchbowl News showed empty alcohol bottles and trash in his office. The pages were lying on the rotunda floor and taking photos of the exquisite dome 470 feet above them, a Senate page tradition, according to former pages, when Van Orden, who was leading a large tour group, approached them.  He called the pages \u201cjackasses\u201d and \u201cpieces of s---,\u201d according to a transcript written issued by a page minutes after the incident and first reported by The Hill.  \u201cWake the f--- up you little s---s. What the f--- are you all doing? Get the f--- out of here. You are defiling the place,\u201d the former Navy Seal shouted at the group. The source told NBC News that Van Orden, 53, also said, \u201cI don\u2019t give a f---who you are. I\u2019m a congressman. My name is Derrick Van Orden, and I represent the 3rd District of Wisconsin,\u201d and he called the group \u201cpieces of s---\u201d multiple times.   The pages, who were 16 and 17 years old, were \u201cvisibly shaken,\u201d according to the source.  Reached for comment regarding the source's allegations, Van Orden's office shared a statement that it gave to some reporters previously but did not dispute the account. \u201cThe Capitol Rotunda served as a field hospital where countless Union soldiers died fighting to free men in the Civil War. I have long said our nation\u2019s Capitol is a symbol of the sacrifice our servicemen and women have made for this country and should never be treated like a frat house common room. Threatening a congressman with bad press to excuse poor behavior is a reminder of everything that\u2019s wrong with Washington,\" the statement read. The U.S. Senate Page Program offers high school students from all 50 states the opportunity to work on the Senate floor, assisting lawmakers and staff with administrative tasks.   \u201cThey come here bright-eyed, ready to learn about America \u2026 and serve the Senate, which they do,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a news conference Thursday evening. \u201cThey\u2019re really invaluable to us.\u201d Several other senators, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., expressed their support for the pages and condemned Van Orden\u2019s behavior. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., called on Van Orden to apologize in a tweet Saturday.  \u201cThis is inexcusable and embarrassing behavior for a member of Congress or any adult for that matter. The Congressman should do the right thing and apologize,\u201d said Tillis, who regularly sponsors pages from North Carolina.   House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., defended Van Orden, telling reporters on Friday that it wasn\u2019t \u201cthe norm\u201d of the congressman. \u201cI guess the interns have some ritual of laying down or something like that. I think it\u2019s a misunderstanding of all sides,\u201d said McCarthy, adding that he had spoken to Schumer about the incident and plans to speak to Van Orden as well. Other lawmakers have poked fun at Van Orden.   Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, himself a former member of the Senate, tweeted a photo from the floor of the rotunda, writing: \u201cTGIF after a rough week, Senate Pages? I got a great photo, how about you?\u201d",

        "content": "A major search for a 14-year-old girl who disappeared from the Phoenix area over three years ago came to a happy end when the young woman, now 18, reported to a police station in Montana, officials said Wednesday. Alicia Navarro went to the small town near the Canadian border recently and said she is the girl who vanished from her Glendale, Arizona, home on Sept. 15, 2019, Glendale police said. \"She is by all accounts safe, she is by all accounts healthy, and she is by all accounts happy,\" Jose Santiago, a spokesman for Glendale police, told reporters at a news conference. The disappearance started as a runaway, police Lt. Scott Waite said, but the case is under investigation, and more details about how she got to Montana remained unclear. \"Every indication she's given to us so far is that she willfully left her home,\" Waite said. \"Now the dynamics surrounding that decision are obviously something we're looking into.\" When Navarro went to police in the very small Montana town, around 40 miles from the U.S.-Canada border, she was alone, and every time she talked to police she did so alone, officials said. \"She showed up to a police department. She identified herself as Alicia Navarro. She basically asked for help to clear her off of a missing juvenile list,\" Santiago said. \"She is not in any kind of trouble. She is not facing any kind of charges,\" he said. Navarro's disappearance sparked a search that included the FBI and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. There were thousands of tips over the years, police said. Waite said that when Navarro was reunited with her mother, it was \"emotionally overwhelming\" for both of them. \"I can say, for everyone involved, including the detectives, it was extremely overwhelming,\" Waite said. Police clarified Friday that the mother and daughter \u201cwere connected electronically.\u201d \u201cThey have not been in physical contact. We are working with Alicia to fulfill her needs/wishes. That said, we have been in communication with her mother,\u201d a spokesperson said. Navarro and her family are asking for privacy, police said. Police would not name the Montana town. \"She wanted to talk to her mom, and she wanted to make sure her mother knew she was OK,\" Santiago said. Navarro is \"very apologetic to what she has put her mother through\" and expressed that it was not intentional and that she hopes to have a relationship with her mother and move on with her life, Santiago said.",

        "title": "Family sues Delta after drunken passenger allegedly groped mom and her teen daughter on flight",
        "content": "A federal lawsuit was filed against Delta Air Lines on Tuesday accusing flight attendants of failing to intervene after a male passenger, according to the lawsuit, was served at least 10 alcoholic drinks and then groped a mother and her 16-year-old daughter. The plaintiff in the suit, filed in the Eastern District of New York, was identified only as the parent of the teenager. According to the filing, the girl and her mother were traveling to Athens, Greece, from New York City on a nearly nine-hour flight last year when the incident occurred. A woman who was assigned the seat next to her daughter, who was in the middle, switched with an unidentified man in order to sit next to her husband, the suit said. The family is referred to by initials throughout, with \"N.A.\" referring to the girl while her mother is identified as \"A.A.\" Before the plane even departed, the man allegedly asked the flight attendant for a \"vodka on the rocks.\" \"Over the first three hours of the flight, the Delta flight attendants served the intoxicated Delta passenger approximately 10 vodka on ice drinks,\" the lawsuit said. The male passenger appeared visibly intoxicated, slurring his speech and continually attempting to get the teenager's attention the more he intoxicated he became, the lawsuit said. When the girl asked him to stop talking to her, the man became \"aggressive\" and yelled at her. He then demanded to know where she lived, identifying himself as a Connecticut resident, and wanted to know her address, according to the filing. \"N.A. was frightened by his personal questions, tone and body language and turned her back to him to tell her mother that she was scared,\" the suit said. \"When N.A. turned away from him, the intoxicated Delta passenger began grabbing N.A., putting his hands on her back.\" The girl's mother also intervened, begging the man to leave her daughter alone. They both told the man that the girl was a minor and still in high school, but he reached over and \"began pulling and pushing\" at the mother's arm, according to the suit. The mother spoke to a flight attendant, saying the passenger was \"very drunk and was making both her and her 16-year-old daughter feel unsafe by yelling, making obscene gestures and touching her daughter inappropriately.\" According to the suit, the flight attendant simply told her to \"be patient\" before walking away. When the man went to the bathroom, the girl's mother once again spoke with the flight attendant and pleaded with staff to stop serving him alcohol. But upon his return the man had a glass of red wine with him, according to the lawsuit. Later on, the girl laid her head in her mother's lap in an effort to ignore the man when he allegedly put his fingers underneath her shirt and up her back. \"N.A. was frozen as she felt the intoxicated Delta passenger\u2019s hand fingering her bra strap and moving over her body,\" the suit said. \"N.A. was trembling, petrified and crying and finally got the courage to jump out of the seat and out of his reach.\" The man then put his hand on the mother's thigh and moved \"toward her vagina,\" the suit said. The girl and her mother then spoke to both the head flight attendant onboard the flight and the pilot, who both, according to the lawsuit, said there was nothing they could do. Another passenger saw both the mother and daughter crying and offered to switch seats to sit next to the drunken passenger after learning about the situation, according to the lawsuit. Despite the flight attendant telling the family she had asked for volunteers to switch with them, the passenger who offered to change seats told the girl and her mother he had not been asked or heard an announcement for volunteers. The man was allowed to leave when the plane landed in Greece and no police were called despite the mother's request that authorities meet them in Athens, the lawsuit said. Delta declined to comment on the litigation but a spokesperson told NBC News in a statement Sunday that the airline has \"zero tolerance for customers who engage in inappropriate or unlawful behavior.\" \"Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and our people,\" the spokesperson said. The lawsuit, which seeks $2 million in damages, accuses Delta of violating New York's human rights law by failing to protect them from sexual misconduct. It also alleges negligence by Delta staff in continuing to serve the passenger despite Federal Aviation Administration policy on serving intoxicated passengers.",

        "content": "A Georgia resident has died from a rare brain-eating amoeba after they were likely infected while swimming in a freshwater lake or pond, officials said. The resident, who has not yet been identified, died after being exposed to Naegleria fowleri, which can cause a rare infection that \"destroys brain tissue, causing brain swelling and usually death,\" the Georgia Department of Public Health said in a news release Friday. It was not clear exactly when the resident died or where they were swimming when they contracted the infection. \"Naegleria fowleri is an amoeba (single-celled living organism) that lives in soil and warm, freshwater lakes, rivers, ponds, and hot springs,\" the health department said. It noted that the amoeba is not found in salt water or in properly treated drinking water or swimming pools. The amoeba is known as the \"brain-eating amoeba\" because it can cause a brain infection when water containing the amoeba goes up the nose, the health department said. \"It cannot infect people if swallowed and is not spread from person to person,\" the department noted. The deadly infection is rare, with only about three people in the United States contracting it each year, \"but these infections are usually fatal,\" the health department said. Prior to this latest case, there have been five other cases reported in Georgia since 1962, according to the department. There have been multiple other cases reported in the U.S. so far this year. In July, a 2-year-old boy from Nevada was confirmed to have died from a Naegleria fowleri infection. The boy, from Lincoln County, just north of the Las Vegas area, may have been exposed at Ash Springs, a natural hot spring in the county, the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health said. In February, a man in Florida also died from an amoeba, which he may have contracted after he rinsed his sinuses with tap water, health officials said. Last year, there were three confirmed cases of Naegleria fowleri that were believed to have occurred after exposure to freshwater in Iowa, Nebraska and Arizona, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Three cases were also reported each year in 2019, 2020 and 2021. \u201cThough the risk of infection is low, recreational water users should always assume there is a risk when they enter warm fresh water,\u201d the Georgia Department of Public Health said. \u201cIf you choose to swim, you can reduce your risk of infection by limiting the amount of water that goes up the nose.\u201d Symptoms of an infection can include \"severe headache, fever, nausea and vomiting and progress to stiff neck, seizures, and coma that can lead to death,\" the department said. \"Once symptoms start, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within about five days.\"",

        "title": "30 dead dogs, 90 alive but in inhumane conditions found at Ohio animal rescue",
        "content": "The operator of an Ohio animal rescue organization faced several felony allegations Sunday after authorities said they discovered 30 dead dogs at two of its locations. The Butler County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Friday that searches of two locations tied to the nonprofit Helping Hands for Furry Paws also turned up 90 living dogs kept in inhumane conditions. Suspect Rhonda Murphy is described as the organization's owner and operator. She faced \"dozens of charges of neglect and cruelty to companion animals, both felony and misdemeanor,\" the office said. It wasn't clear if she was arrested, booked, or formally charged. Court records turned up no information on the matter, and Murphy wasn't listed as an inmate. It wasn't clear if Murphy had legal representation. The public defender for the area did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sheriff's office said its dog wardens and humane officers found the dead dogs at a rescue location that was one of two addresses searched in Madison Township. Helping Hands for Furry Paws is listed on websites that offer background on nonprofit groups as being in Middleton, a city adjacent to Madison Township that occupies part of Butler County. The dead animals were discovered in refrigerators and freezers, some not working, in various states of decomposition, the sheriff's office said in its statement. The reasons behind the search, and whether it was executed with a judge's permission, were not revealed in the sheriff's statement, and a contact for the office's dog wardens did not immediately respond to an inquiry. Deputies also found dogs that were alive but in need of fresh air, food, and water, were also discovered at the location, the sheriff's office said. \"One garage housed over 25 dogs in cages with no ventilation or air conditioning, with measured indoor temperatures of 89 degrees,\" it said. Their cages contained fecal matter and urine, and lacked food and water, the sheriff's office alleged. \"One cage contained a mother and eight newborn puppies,\" it said. Another location, described by the sheriff's office as \"the main house,\" contained 11 dogs. Photos depict hoarder-like conditions, although it wasn't clear which locations are shown. Sheriff's officials described the odor there as \"horrendous\" in the statement, which said deputies had to take breaks to walk outside for fresh air. The Animal Friends Humane Society took the seized dogs, an act that nearly doubled its animal population, reported NBC affiliate WLWT of Cincinnati.",

        "title": "Paul Reubens,\u00a0actor best known as Pee-wee Herman, dies at 70",
        "content": "Actor Paul Reubens, who came to fame in the 1980s as children's TV star Pee-wee Herman, has died years after a cancer diagnosis, his team said Monday. He was 70. \"Last night we said farewell to Paul Reubens, an iconic American actor, comedian, writer and producer whose beloved character Pee-wee Herman delighted generations of children and adults with his positivity, whimsy and belief in the importance of kindness,\" according to a statement posted to his Facebook. \"Paul bravely and privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit. A gifted and prolific talent, he will forever live in the comedy pantheon and in our hearts as a treasured friend and man of remarkable character and generosity of spirit.\" It had not been previously disclosed that Reubens was diagnosed with cancer. The announcement of his death included a personal statement from the actor, explaining why he had kept his medical condition under wraps. \u201cPlease accept my apology for not going public with what I\u2019ve been facing the last six years,\" he wrote. \"I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you.\u201d Reubens rocketed to fame for creating the sarcastic but good-natured man-child Pee-wee Herman, a character whose red bowtie and sneering catch phrases \u2014 \u201cI know you are, but what am I?\u201d \u2014 were ubiquitous in the \u201880s and early \u201890s. Pee-wee was the star of a Los Angeles stage play produced by Reubens that gained enough of a following that HBO recorded and broadcast a performance in 1981.  That eventually led to Reubens\u2019 big break, the 1985 movie \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure,\u201d helmed by first-time feature film director Tim Burton. The movie followed Pee-wee\u2019s surreal and slapstick journey to find his missing bicycle and, while a modest box office hit, became a cult favorite. The success of \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure\u201d led to Reubens landing a Saturday morning CBS show, \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d The live action show was a hit with kids and adults alike and ran from 1986 to 1991. But Reubens' rise to fame was halted in 1991 after he pleaded no contest to indecent exposure at an adult movie theater in Sarasota, Florida. Then in 2004, Reubens was sentenced to three years probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor obscenity charge involving photographs of minors engaged in sexual conduct that were seized from him. Those brushes with the law dented but didn't derail Reubens' career. He returned to the big screen following the indecent exposure incident with a cameo as the Penguin's father in Burton's 1992 blockbuster sequel, \"Batman Returns.\" That same year, he fully shed his Pee-wee persona by playing a snarling blood-sucker in the \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" film. Reubens won critical acclaim in 2001 for playing a drug-dealing hairdresser in the movie \"Blow,\" starring alongside Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp. His TV credits included appearances on \"30 Rock,\" \"The Blacklist\" and \"Gotham.\" \"Paul Reubens was like no one else \u2014 a brilliant and original comedian who made kids and their parents laugh at the same time,\" late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel said in a statement. \"He never forgot a birthday and shared his genuine delight for silliness with everyone he met. My family and I will miss him.\" Comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien recalled \"the magic, generosity, artistry, and devout silliness of Paul Reubens.\" \"Everyone I know received countless nonsensical memes from Paul on their birthday, and I mean EVERYONE,\" O'brien said in a statement. \"His surreal comedy and unrelenting kindness were a gift to us all. Damn, this hurts.\"",

The 14-year-old was hanging out with three other minors and listening to music at his father's home at 104 Cabresto Road in Questa around 2:30 p.m., police said. \"At some point, a 14-year-old male took out a pistol and pointed it at a 13-year-old female,\" the Department of Public Safety said in a news release. \"The male pulled the trigger, fatally wounding the female. The male then dragged the female\u2019s body outside and returned to the residence.\" Police said the pistol belonged to the teen's father, 39-year-old William Brown. Brown came home after the fatal shooting. When officers arrived to investigate the homicide, both Brown and his son would not come out of the home for around 30 minutes, officials said. The teen was arrested and booked into the San Juan Juvenile Detention Center in Farmington. He was charged with an open count of murder in the first degree, two counts of tampering with evidence and two counts of assault on a police officer. Officials didn't clarify why the 14-year-old was charged with assault on a police officer. Brown was arrested and charged with \"negligent making a firearm accessible to a minor resulting in death\" and booked into the Taos County Detention Center.    \"Out of respect for the victim\u2019s family, the New Mexico State Police will not release the name of the juvenile victim,\" the Department of Public Safety said. \"We also will not release the name of the juvenile suspect via press release.\" The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and once complete, will be turned over to the District Attorney\u2019s office.

Besides Beijing, heavy rain continued to soak the neighboring city of Tianjin as well as Hebei province in a region nearly the size of Britain in the wake of Doksuri, which was downgraded to a tropical depression on the weekend. Three of the five rivers that make up the Hai river basin rose to dangerous levels on Monday. Some houses were washed into the Yongding river, and nearly 55,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Baoding city, state media reported. Doksuri was one of the strongest storms to hit China in years and caused widespread flooding over the weekend in the southern province of Fujian, driving hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. Average rainfall in Beijing reached 176.9 mm (7 inches) between Saturday night and Monday afternoon, with the maximum recorded rainfall in Mentougou district hitting 580.9 mm (23 inches), according to state media. The Beijing observatory kept a red alert \u2014 the highest warning \u2014 for heavy rainfall in place while Beijing Hydrology Station upgraded its flood warning with more rain and river flooding forecast. More than 31,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Beijing, work at more than 4,000 construction sites was halted, almost 20,000 buildings were inspected for damage, and scenic spots in the city were closed, media reported. Both airports in the capital cancelled more than 180 flights on Monday morning, with hundreds more delayed, according to flight tracking app Flight Master. Railway authorities dispatched workers to send food including instant noodles, eggs and ham, and drinking water to train passengers who were stuck overnight. As many as 358 roads in Beijing were affected by the rain as of Monday. There was no reported damage or casualties, state media said, but south of Beijing, Doksuri\u2019s impact was more pronounced. In northern Hebei province, a driver was missing after two trucks fell off a collapsed bridge in Baoding city on Sunday, while a railway bridge for freight in Shijiazhuang city was washed away in a swollen river, media reported. While Doksuri continues to taper off, forecasters warned that typhoon Khanun was approaching and was set to strike China\u2019s densely populated coast this week. Authorities said Khanun could inflict further damage to corn and other crops that have already been hit by Doksuri.",

        "title": "Israel is in turmoil after judicial overhaul vote. What now?",
        "content": "Israel faces extraordinary turmoil and a democratic crisis as opposition leaders and protesters step up their campaign against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s judicial overhaul plan. Netanyahu and his coalition allies on the religious and political right won a key victory Monday by voting through the first part of the overhaul, removing the right of judges on the Supreme Court to overrule Cabinet ministers\u2019 decisions for being \u201cunreasonable.\u201d In response, thousands of protesters blocked streets outside the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, some of whom had camped overnight in a nearby park. Leading Israeli newspapers published entirely black front pages Tuesday. NBC News explains the latest developments and why they matter. What happened Monday? On Monday, the Knesset passed one of its most contentious laws since Israel was founded in 1948. While the ability to overrule Cabinet ministers\u2019 decisions for being \u201cunreasonable\u201d is rarely used, it was employed in January when the court ruled that the appointment of a minister was \u201cunreasonable in the extreme\u201d because of his criminal convictions. Netanyahu, much to his displeasure, had no choice but to remove him. The change is part of a long-promised raft of proposals from Netanyahu\u2019s coalition of far-right and hard-line religious parties. Netanyahu has long argued that the Supreme Court is a liberal, politically motivated body in need of reform. There were hopes that a compromise could be reached. But the ruling coalition passed the law by 64 votes, with none against \u2014 opposition lawmakers left the parliament chamber in protest during the roll call. In a statement addressed to the Israeli people Monday, Netanyahu said, \u201cWe passed the amendment on the reason of reasonableness, so that the elected government could lead the policy in accordance with the decision of the majority of the country\u2019s citizens.\u201d Far-right Cabinet minister Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of the Religious Zionist Party, said in a statement that the change had started \u201cto repair the judicial system and restore the balance between the authorities that was violated 30 years ago by Aharon Barak,\u201d referring to the former president of the Supreme Court who developed the \u201creasonableness\u201d test. Why is it so important? Unlike the U.S. Congress, Israel\u2019s parliament has just one house, and there is no written constitution, giving the government a high degree of autonomy. The ability of judges to intervene was seen as a vital check on executive power.  It may sound like a technical detail, but the division this and other proposed changes have caused is unlike anything long-standing observers have seen. \u201cThis is a serious threat. This has never happened before, and we are going into a civil war now,\u201d Ehud Olmert, who was prime minister from 2006 to 2009, told the British broadcaster Channel 4 News on Monday.  Protesters, including military reservists and the 150 or so businesses that closed Monday in solidarity, say putting even more power in the hands of the prime minister is a risk. \u201cThe fear is that if they get this through, they will weaken democracy, especially because there are many elements in the coalition who are not very democratic \u2014 the far right is not very democratic,\u201d said Gideon Rahat, an Israeli politics expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \u201cThe only check and balance we have is the courts \u2014 we don\u2019t have strong local government; we don\u2019t have constituencies. \u2026 And the government is trying to weaken it,\u201d he said. What happens next? It is far from over. Protests will continue, and more judicial changes are coming. In a twist, it\u2019s possible that Israel\u2019s judges could end up deciding the fate of the \u201creasonableness\u201d bill. The Movement for Quality Government, a good governance group, has filed a petition to the court arguing that the change is illegal. Future proposed laws would give the government greater powers to appoint judges and remove ministries\u2019 independent legal advisers.  No demonstrations were expected Tuesday, but protest groups have vowed to carry on as Netanyahu plans to take the rest of his judicial changes to parliament.  \u201cThe government of the destruction of the house voted to crush the State of Israel as we knew it \u2014 we will fight them to the end,\u201d the Black Flags protest group said in a statement. Histradut, the country\u2019s trade union umbrella group, said after Monday\u2019s votes that it would convene a meeting of its members to discuss a general strike. But while the government has shown no signs of relenting, the sheer scope of the opposition to Netanyahu\u2019s changes could be too much, some said.  \u201cThe protests and other pressures, such as what Biden might do and the economy, that all might restrict this plan,\u201d Rahat said. \u201cI think they did not predict this amount of rejection.\u201d President Joe Biden has repeatedly urged Netanyahu not to impose his judicial plan on an angry public, with the White House again making that clear in a statement Monday, adding that Biden has been a \u201clifelong friend\u201d to Israel.   The columnist Thomas Friedman of The New York Times suggested that only Biden has the power to stop Netanyahu\u2019s plan.  Netanyahu, who has survived numerous political crises over his many years in power and is on trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, which he denies, may ultimately lose out in his quest to remake Israel\u2019s judicial system. \u201cNetanyahu is riding the back of a tiger, but sometimes the tiger takes him places he doesn\u2019t want to be taken,\u201d Rahat said.",

        "content": "A Georgia judge on Monday denied an attempt by Donald Trump to halt Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's investigation into whether the former president and his allies interfered in the state\u2019s 2020 presidential election, calling his allegations of wrongdoing in the probe \"overwrought.\" In a nine-page ruling Monday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney found that neither Trump nor Cathleen Latham, a Trump \"alternate elector\" challenging the probe, had legal standing to block the investigation at this point. He said their claims are \u201cinsufficient\" because \"while being the subject (or even target) of a highly publicized criminal investigation is likely an unwelcome and unpleasant experience, no court ever has held that that status alone provides a basis for the courts to interfere with or halt the investigation.\u201d The ruling is the second against Trump on the issue in two weeks. The Georgia Supreme Court denied a similar request from Trump on July 17. A third petition to the Fulton County Superior Court is pending, with a hearing scheduled for Aug. 10. In his Monday ruling, McBurney suggested his ruling should make the third action moot. He noted that Trump could raise the same concerns to the courts after he's indicted, but said it's premature for him to do so now. \u201cGuessing at what that picture might look like before the investigative dots are connected may be a popular game for the media and blogosphere, but it is not a proper role for the courts and formal legal argumentation,\u201d McBurney wrote. \"There will be time and forum in which Trump and Latham can raise their concerns about the constitutionality of the special purpose grand jury statutes, about the performance of this particular Special Purpose Grand Jury (and the judge supervising it), and about the propriety of allowing the Fulton County District Attorney to remain involved with whatever criminal prosecution \u2014 if any results from the work of this Special Purpose Grand Jury. That time is not now and that forum is not here. \"Should either (or both) movant be indicted, they can raise all these issues (as they undoubtedly will) before the judge,\" he wrote. The district attorney's office declined comment on the ruling. Representatives for Trump and Latham did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in the case and maintains Willis, a Democrat, is leading a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him. Willis has indicated that she could seek indictments in the case in the first half of August. Trump has also been notified by special counsel Jack Smith that he's a target in his federal investigation into interference in the 2020 election. Trump has denied wrongdoing and accused Smith of \"election interference\" since Trump is now running for president.",

Chris Coons, Joe Biden's campaign co-chair, said Sunday on NBC's on \"Meet the Press\" that it \"may be worth looking at\u201d a congressional code of ethics for presidential family members.

Todd mentioned calls for the Supreme Court to set up a code of conduct after reports about potential ethics lapses by Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor. \u201cShould presidential family members be a separate, you know, perhaps come under a little additional scrutiny?\u201d Todd asked. \u201cThat may be worth looking at because frankly, as you referenced, Jared Kushner wasn\u2019t just a private citizen,\u201d Coons said. \u201cHe worked in the White House and engaged in economic\u2014\u201c Todd added: \u201cTo me if you're outraged about Hunter Biden, you should be outraged about Jared Kushner.

Hunter Biden last week pleaded not guilty to federal tax charges after a plea deal he struck with the government unraveled when U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee, raised questions about the terms of the agreement. The parties are expected to reconvene in the coming weeks to hammer out the terms and provide Noreika more information. Coons' comment also come as Republican presidential candidates have ramped up personal attacks against Biden and his family over his lack of a relationship with one of Hunter Biden\u2019s daughters. Hunter Biden and the mother of the child, Lunden Roberts, recently settled a paternity case in an Arkansas court. Hunter previously described his relationship with Roberts as a short-lived fling while he battled addiction. Conservative news outlets targeted the president for not having acknowledged the child as one of his grandchildren in recent comments. But the president on Friday publicly acknowledged his seventh grandchild for the first time, saying that his granddaughter Navy is \u201cnot a political issue.\u201d",

        "content": "A 6-year-old girl died in Arizona in a horrific boating accident Friday after her mother accidentally struck the child with a boat propeller on Friday, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Office. A group of 12 people made up of two families were on a boat since 7 a.m. on Lake Pleasant. At 11 a.m. one of the families called 911 to report their young daughter had been hit by the boat\u2019s propeller. \"Witnesses at the scene confirmed that the child\u2019s mother was operating the boat when she began to drive and, unbeknownst to the family, the child had somehow entered the water,\" the sheriff's office said in a news release. \"The father of the child was in the water holding onto a wakeboard when he noticed someone in the water and swam to the child.\" The parents realized their child was in the water and that her leg had been amputated by the boat\u2019s propeller, according to the sheriff's office. The 6-year-old was taken to the lake's marina by her family where first responders rendered aid and transported her to a nearby hospital. She was pronounced dead at the hospital. \"The incident remains under investigation and impairment does not appear to be a factor as MCSO detectives continue to investigate,\" the sheriff's office said.",

        "title": "Body camera footage shows family held at gunpoint after police typo IDs car as stolen",
        "content": "Texas police held a Black family at gunpoint earlier this month after a typo lead police to wrongly believe their car was stolen. During the incident, an officer admitted to identifying the family's license as being from Arizona, rather than their home state of Arkansas. The incident, which unfolded on July 23 in Frisco, Texas, was captured on multiple officers' body cameras. The emotional footage, released Saturday, shows several members of the Frisco Police Department demanding the family \u2014 who identified themselves as husband, wife, their son and nephew \u2014 exit the car. They identified the boys as 12 and 13 years old. An officer also pointed his gun at at least one of the children and handcuffed him, according to the footage. At one point, the officer who ran the family's plates admits her error. \u201cIt looks like I made a mistake. So I ran it \u2018AZ\u2019 for Arizona instead of \u2018AR,\u2019 and that\u2019s what happened,\u201d she says, according to the footage. Later, the husband becomes emotional and says: \u201cIt could\u2019ve went all wrong for us though.\u201d \u201cIf I would\u2019ve went to reach for my phone, we could\u2019ve all got killed,\u201d he says, before walking away sobbing. NBC News was not immediately able to identify or reach the family members involved in the incident. In a statement released Friday, Frisco Police Chief David Shilson said the department \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and \u201cwill not hide from its mistakes.\u201d \u201cInstead, we will learn from them,\u201d Shilson said. \u201cThe officer involved quickly accepted responsibility for what happened, which speaks to integrity.\u201d Body camera footage shows emotional scene Body camera footage from the officer \u2014 who later admitted to incorrectly identifying the license plate \u2014 shows police with their guns raised, demanding members of the family exit their car on the Dallas North Tollway. Officers had closed down the southbound lanes while responding to the incident, according to information released by the Frisco Police Department. The mother and her son exited the car while the father and nephew remained inside, according to the footage. Body camera footage from another officer at the scene shows officers forcing one of the children to walk backwards from the car with his hands raised as at least one officer points a gun at him.  After exiting, the mother, who was driving the car tells the officer that she is from Little Rock, Arkansas, has always had that registration for that car, and has \"never been in trouble a day in my life,\" according to the footage from the officer who made the typo. The mother also informs officers that there's a gun locked in her glove compartment and that she's licensed to carry a gun. The mother then looks over towards her son, and asks, \u201cIs he in cuffs? This is very traumatizing,\" according to the video. \u201cWhy is my baby in cuffs?\u201d she wails. \u201cWhat are y\u2019all doing?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re just detaining him, it doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d the officer responds. \u201cNo,\u201d the woman yells, prompting the officer to tell her to \u201cstop\u201d four times. Moment officer realizes error Soon after, the officer walks away from the woman, appears to spend a few seconds checking something in the police vehicle and then approaches another officer and says, \"I don't understand.\" The other officer asks, \"Did you not run that out of Arkansas?\" The officer responds, \"I did \u2014 AR.\" Body camera footage then shows the officer explaining the situation to the husband, whose name is muted on the footage, and one of the boys, whose face is blurred. \"I ran your tag, it came back to, associated essentially with no vehicle,\" the officer told the man. \"So I confirmed it with my dispatch \u2014 I'm like, 'That's weird,'\" the officer says. Soon after, the footage appears to feature another police officer saying in the background, \u201cShe ran it out of the wrong state.\" The officer who made the typo protests and says, \"AR, AR is Arkansas, correct?\" Appearing to look at the officer's initial computer search in the cruiser, another officer responds: \"It's Arizona though. It's not Arizona.\" \"Oh, I see what you're saying,\" the officer responds. \"That's on me.\" Body camera footage shows a different officer informing another officer \u2014 who still had his gun pointed toward the car with the husband and nephew inside \u2014 of the mistake. The officers then put their guns down, and four officers approach the car, none of whom made the error. \"Listen bro, we just here for a basketball tournament,\" the husband tells police as one of the boys cries in the back of the car. \"We just learned, right now, that's why we stopped,\" an officer responds. \"Don't do this to my son, bro,\" the husband wails. After the husband and boy get out of the car, footage from an officer at the scene shows him explaining the mistake to the young boy who was crying in the back of the car, saying, \"We're so sorry you had to go through that.\" The rest of the footage shows officers repeatedly apologizing to the family and the officer who made incorrectly identified the plate admitting the error. A family member appears to say, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d The officer responds: \u201cIt\u2019s not fine, and whatever happens to me, I\u2019ll deal with that.\u201d The officer also tells the wife, who had been driving the car: \"This is all my fault. I apologize for this. I know it was very traumatic for you and your nephew and your son. And like I said, it\u2019s on me. There are consequences that come with that.\" The video ends with the officer who made the error shaking hands with the husband after he calms down. The husband tells the officer, \"It's all good.\" Officer\u2019s error led to stop, police chief says A news release from the department states also shed more light on how the situation unfolded and how the error was made. An officer from the Frisco Police Department \u201cobserved a black Dodge Charger with an out of state license plate leaving a hotel\u201d and checked the car\u2019s Arkansas license plate \u201cdue to recent burglaries and vehicle thefts in which Chargers are frequently stolen.\u201d \u201cThe officer then initiated a high-risk traffic stop on the Dallas North Tollway, which is standard procedure for stolen vehicles,\u201d the department\u2019s news release said. But the officer accidentally entered the license plate as being from Arizona, according to the department. When a sergeant arrived on the scene, they \u201crealized the mistake and immediately ordered officers to \u2018stand down\u2019 and ended the high-risk stop,\u201d according to information from the department. The news release states the department initiated an incident review the same day of the incident \u201cto determine what happened, how it was managed, and to evaluate what needed to be addressed to prevent this from happening in the future.\u201d The initial assessment revealed the need for officers to accurately enter information, according to the department, which also promised that \u201can ongoing review will identify further changes to training, policies, and procedures.\u201d Shilson, the police chief, said he has spoken with the family, adding, \u201cI empathize with them and completely understand why they\u2019re upset. I apologized on behalf of our department and assured them that we will hold ourselves accountable and provide transparency through the process.\u201d \u201cThis incident does not reflect the high standard of service that our officers provide on a daily basis to our residents, businesses and visitors,\u201d Shilson said. A spokesperson for the Frisco Police Department did not immediately respond to questions from NBC News on Monday morning, including about whether the officer who made the error has faced any disciplinary action and whether the incident has prompted any changes to the department\u2019s policies or procedures as to how they conduct so-called high-risk traffic stops.",

        "content": "A woman who says she was hit by a microphone rapper Cardi B hurled into the crowd at a Las Vegas concert has filed a police report for battery, authorities say. The singer was performing \"Bodak Yellow\" at Drai's Beachclub on Saturday before a raucous crowd when a fan threw a large drink on stage, videos circulating on social media show. Cardi B appeared shocked for a moment then threw her microphone toward the fan. The microphone appeared to hit the fan and another woman and ricocheted into the air. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said a woman, who was not named, reported a battery case to police one day after the concert. The woman said \u201cshe was struck by an item that was thrown from the stage\u201d during a concert Saturday, police said in a statement. The incident has been documented in a police report, but no arrest or citations have been issued, officials said. No further information was released.  NBC News has reached out to reps for Cardi B for comment. Drai's Las Vegas did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. In recent months, a number of high-profile artists have been hit by objects while performing. In June, singer Bebe Rexha shared images of her bruised eye after a concertgoer threw a phone at her during a concert at Pier 17 in Manhattan. Nicolas Malvagna, the man charged in the incident, allegedly told a witness he \u201cthought it would be funny\u201d to hit Rexha. His attorney said he was just hoping Rexha would take photos on stage and throw the phone back. Country singer Kelsea Ballerini was hit in the face by an object while singing \u201cIf You Go Down (I\u2019m Goin\u2019 Down Too)\u201d during a show in Idaho in June. Harry Styles was also hit with an object during a show in Vienna in early July. Experts have said they think fans are throwing objects in bids for attention.",

        "title": "Lori Vallow gets multiple life sentences in murders of her 2 kids and romantic rival, speaks of 'spirit world' in court",
        "content": "Lori Vallow Daybell received multiple life sentences in prison without the possibility of parole in the deaths of her two children and that of her husband\u2019s previous wife, a case that drew national intrigue after her children disappeared nearly four years ago. Vallow Daybell was convicted in May in the murders of her kids, Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 16, as well as conspiracy to commit murder in the death of Tammy Daybell. Judge Steven W. Boyce ordered she serve consecutive life sentences on the individual murder charges because the crimes occurred at different times. Before her sentencing, Vallow Daybell addressed the court claiming that a near death experience allowed her to communicate with the \u201cspirit world.\u201d She told the judge that she knew \u201cfor a fact\u201d that her children and Tammy Daybell were happy in heaven. Tylee and Joshua have communicated with her that they are happy after their deaths, Vallow Daybell said. \u201cJesus knows me and Jesus understands me,\u201d she said. \u201cI mourn with all of you who mourn my children and Tammy. Jesus Christ knows the truth of what happened here, Jesus Christ knows no one was murdered in this case. Accidental deaths happen, suicides happen, fatal side effects from medications happen.\u201d Boyce noted that Vallow Daybell's last mental health evaluation showed that she suffered from \"hyper religiosity\" and \"unspecified personality disorder with histrionic and narcissistic features,\" according to the judge. But she also refused to comply with court ordered screening that may have mitigated her sentencing, Boyce noted. \"After all of this evidence and trial you haven't shown any remorse,\" Boyce said. \"You haven't said you're sorry. You haven't done anything to seek leniency from this court.\" Tylee is Vallow Daybell's biological daughter from her third marriage to Joseph Ryan, who died of a heart attack in 2018. Joshua was adopted in 2014 by Lori and her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. She and her fifth and current husband, Chad Daybell, were accused of being obsessed with doomsday prophecies and believed that people could become \"zombies\" possessed by evil spirits. Prosecutors read a statement Monday by Colby Ryan, Vallow Daybell's adult son, who said that his mother's actions have kept him from being able to share his life with the people he loved the most. \"My children will never know their uncle, their aunt or grandfather, or even their grandmother,\" he said in the statement. \"Tylee and JJ brought so much light into this world. With their lives stolen, I'd like to share this: I believe nothing could or ever will be the same.\" Prosecutors described Vallow Daybell as a woman who would \"remove any obstacle in her way\" and would use \"money, power, and sex to get what she wanted\" during the weekslong trial earlier this year. Her attorney argued that she was a loving mother who became intrigued in biblical prophecies about the end of the world. Authorities first began the search for Tylee and Joshua in November 2019, after several family members contacted authorities concerned that they hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to the children since September. Police said that Vallow Daybell and her husband lied to authorities about the children's whereabouts during the investigation and failed to comply with court orders to physically produce the children. Their remains were found the following year, in June 2020, on property owned by Chad Daybell in Fremont County, Idaho. Court documents said that Joshua, who was adopted and had special needs, was buried in a pet cemetery, and that Tylee\u2019s remains were dismembered and burned in a fire pit. In October 2019, Tammy Daybell was found dead of what were believed to be natural causes at the time. Investigators later exhumed her body and conducted an autopsy, which ruled her death was a homicide. Vallow Daybell married Chad Daybell just weeks after his previous wife's death. Prosecutors said during her trial that she took part in the conspiracy to kill Tammy Daybell so that she and Chad Daybell could be together. Chad Daybell, a self-published author who wrote doomsday-focused fiction, is awaiting trial on the same murder charges.  Charles and Vallow Daybell were married in 2006 and were estranged by 2019, when divorce papers were filed. According to police documents obtained by NBC affiliate KSL, Charles Vallow learned that his wife was having an affair with Chad Daybell in June 2019 and was shot by his brother-in-law, Alex Cox, weeks later. Vallow Daybell and Cox were questioned at the time but weren\u2019t charged, as they claimed self-defense. A grand jury charged her with conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree nearly two years after his death, the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office said. She will be tried separately, in Arizona, in that case. Cox died in December 2019 from a pulmonary embolism. Kay Woodcock, Charles Vallow\u2019s sister and Joshua's biological grandmother, cried in court Monday during her victim impact statement at the sentencing hearing. \"The grief my family and I have endured is immeasurable as Lori cruelly took my big brother Charles, my adorable grandson JJ, and my beautiful niece Tylee, and sweet Tammy \u2014 whose family I've come to know and love,\" Woodcock said. \"Lori is undeniably a monster.\" Her husband, Larry Woodcock, spoke to reporters following the sentencing and did not speak highly of Vallow Daybell's statement in court. \"That was a bucket of s---,\" he said.",

Jessica Nu\u00f1ez made her plea in a video posted on the Facebook page \u201cFinding Alicia\u201d Sunday, thanking the public for their support over the past few years.  \u201cI can\u2019t even put into the words the amount of gratitude I have for you all,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that we know that Alicia is alive, I have to ask one more favor of you. I know you want answers, and I do too. But the public search for answers has taken a turn for the dangerous.\u201d Nu\u00f1ez said she has been harassed and her family has been attacked on the internet. \u201cThe public has gone from trying to help Alicia to doing things like trying to show up to her house and putting her safety in jeopardy,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez explained.  She asked the public to refrain from posting TikToks about her daughter and to stop reaching out to the teen or her family \u201cwith your speculations or questions or assumptions.\u201d   \u201cThis is not a movie, this is our life,\u201d the mother said, stressing she\u2019ll continue to protect her daughter.  \u201cFor this is my statement, there is an ongoing investigation, and I\u2019m begging you to move on,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez concluded. Navarro was 14 years old when she disappeared from the Phoenix area on Sept. 15, 2019. Now 18, she reported to a police station in a small Montana town near the Canadian border recently and identified herself as a missing person.   Nu\u00f1ez told NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d in 2020 that she had found a note in her daughter\u2019s bedroom saying she ran away, which she said was out of character. She added that her daughter was on the autism spectrum and could be shy or anxious in some social situations. Glendale Police spokesman Jose Santiago said at a news conference earlier this month: \u201cShe is by all accounts safe, she is by all accounts healthy, and she is by all accounts happy.\u201d \u201cShe is not in any kind of trouble. She is not facing any kind of charges,\u201d he added. Police Lt. Scott Waite said the case remains under investigation. Police did not immediately have details about how she arrived in Montana. \u201cEvery indication she\u2019s given to us so far is that she willfully left her home,\u201d Waite said. \u201cNow, the dynamics surrounding that decision are obviously something we\u2019re looking into.\u201d Officials said she arrived at the police station by herself. Santiago said she \u201cbasically asked for help to clear her off of a missing juvenile list.\u201d Police shared a videoclip Thursday showing the moment Navarro told authorities no one had hurt her. When police announced Navarro was found, they said she had been reunited with her mother \u201celectronically.\u201d Santiago said: \u201cShe wanted to talk to her mom, and she wanted to make sure her mother knew she was OK.\u201d",

It made all the difference.\" The pop star was forced to delay her upcoming \u201cCelebration\u201d tour after spending several days in an intensive care unit due to a \"serious bacterial infection,\" her manager Guy Oseary said in an Instagram post last month. A source close to Madonna told NBC News in late June that she was back at home and \u201cfeeling better\" after the ordeal. The artist had previously been slated to kick off the tour with guest Bob the Drag Queen in Canada on July 15, with the tour expected to conclude in Mexico at the end of January. The show celebrating her four decades in music was expected to span North America and Europe, according to her website. In her Instagram post, Madonna said the \"love and support from my friends\" also aided in her recovery. Sharing a series of photos, Madonna noted that one of the images shows her holding a \"Polaroid taken by Andy Warhol of Keith Haring wearing a jacket with Michael Jackson\u2019s face painted on it,\" which she said was a gift from Oseary. \"I sobbed when I opened this gift because I realized how lucky I am to be alive,\" she said. \"And how fortunate I am to have known these people and so many others who are also gone.\" \"Thank you @guyoseary for this gift!\" she wrote. \"And Thank you to all my angels who protected me and let me Stay to finish doing my work!\"",

        "title": "War is returning to Russia, Zelenskyy says after drone attacks",
        "content": "The Kremlin said Monday it was stepping up Russia's air defenses following a new wave of drone attacks inside the country and after Ukraine\u2019s leader warned the war was \u201creturning\u201d home. \u201cGiven the evolving situation, additional measures have been taken to improve defenses against air and sea-based attacks,\u201d Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told a military conference Monday. His announcement came after the latest in a series of attempted drone assaults that Moscow has accused Kyiv of carrying out to compensate for a struggling counteroffensive on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials accused Russia of a deadly new attack on civilians in the heart of the country. Russian officials said three Ukrainian drones targeting Moscow were shot down early Sunday, hours before a major military parade attended by President Vladimir Putin. Images from a crash site in the capital showed the fa\u00e7ade of a skyscraper damaged on one floor, with glass shattered and structural beams snapped and deformed. Kyiv has stopped short of taking responsibility for the drone attacks, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested Sunday this could mark a new chapter. \u201cGradually, the war is returning to the territory of Russia \u2014 to its symbolic centers and military bases, and this is an inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process,\u201d Zelenskyy said Sunday in his nightly video address. The Moscow attack, which injured at least one person and resulted in the closure of the city's airspace, followed a dramatic aerial assault on the Russian capital earlier this summer. Since then a series of drone assaults have targeted strategic sites across the country, increasingly bringing home the reality of the war to the Russian public. Last week, a drone fell in the center of the capital near the defense ministry headquarters, while another gutted a few upper floors of another building. \u201cThere is always something flying in Russia, including in Moscow,\u201d Ukrainian air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat said Sunday on Ukrainian national television. \u201cNo matter how hard the Russian authorities want to turn a blind eye to this and say they have shot everything down, something is still arriving.\u201d  The Kremlin has largely played down the threat, seeking to paint the assaults as a sign of desperation in Kyiv. Ukraine's long-awaited counteroffensive has so far struggled to achieve a breakthrough, with Russia's defensive lines largely holding firm. \u201cThe attack shows the terrorist nature of the Kyiv regime,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a call with reporters Monday. \u201cThe counteroffensive is not going as planned, so Ukraine is opting for targeting civilian infrastructure. It\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he said. Russia hit back Monday with a missile assault on civilian buildings in central Ukraine, killing at least five including a young child and leaving others likely trapped under the rubble, Zelenskyy said. The attacks hit sites including a university and a residential building in Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy's hometown, officials said. While Russia has denied targeting civilian infrastructure, aerial bombardments for months have targeted almost everything from hospitals to playgrounds to apartment blocks. \u201cIn recent days, the enemy has been stubbornly attacking cities, city centers, shelling civilian objects and housing,\u201d Zelenskyy said Monday in a telegram post.",

The Georgia Department of Natural Resources told news outlets that a neighbor was able to pull the man from the water. The man was taken to Northside Forsyth Hospital where he later died. WAGA-TV reported that the Forsyth County Sheriff\u2019s Office identified the man as Thomas Milner. The sheriff\u2019s office told the news outlet that neighbors took a boat over to try to help Milner and one person jumped in the water. That person said that he felt a burning sensation that he recognized as electrical shock. He swam ashore, turned off the power, and then re-entered the water to help Milner. Electric shock drowning can occur when electrical current leaks into surrounding waters, causing a swimmer to become incapacitated, according to the Electric Shock Drowning Prevention Association, an organization dedicated to raising awareness and educating people on the risks of electric shock in water.",

        "title": "Russia\u2019s Prigozhin says Wagner is not recruiting now, may do so in future",
        "content": "Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a voice message published on Monday that his Wagner group was not currently recruiting fighters but was likely to do so in future. The future of Wagner and Prigozhin has been unclear since he led a short mutiny against the Russian defence establishment in late June and the Kremlin said he and some of his fighters \u2014 who have fought in some of the fiercest battles of the Ukraine war \u2014 would leave for Belarus. Despite that, Prigozhin attended a meeting with Putin five days after the mutiny and was photographed last week in St Petersburg, where President Vladimir Putin was hosting African leaders. \u201cToday we are defining our next tasks, whose outline is becoming clearer and clearer. Undoubtedly, these are tasks that will be carried out in the name of the greatness of Russia,\u201d a voice sounding like Prigozhin\u2019s said in the message. It was published on Grey Zone, a Telegram channel affiliated with Wagner. After the June mutiny, the Kremlin said Wagner fighters who had not taken part would transfer to the regular army, signing contracts with the Defence Ministry. Apparently alluding to this, Prigozhin said in the voice message that \u201cunfortunately\u201d some of his fighters had moved to other \u201cpower structures\u201d, but he said they were looking to return. \u201cAs long as we don\u2019t experience a shortage in personnel, we don\u2019t plan to carry out a new recruitment,\u201d Prigozhin said. \u201cHowever, we will be extremely grateful to you if you keep in touch with us, and as soon as the Motherland needs to create a new group that will be able to protect the interests of our country, we will certainly start recruiting.\u201d Since the mutiny, some Wagner fighters have moved to Belarus and started training its army. In comments published last week, Prigozhin also said Wagner was ready to further increase its presence in Africa. Its role there, especially in support of governments in Mali and Central African Republic, is a source of concern for Western governments. The United States has accused it of committing widespread atrocities and imposed sanctions on it as a criminal organisation. Prigozhin says it works in line with the laws of the countries where it operates. Last week he welcomed a military coup in the west African state of Niger and made what appeared to be a pitch for his fighters to bring order there.",

        "title": "What to know about the Lori Vallow murder trial",
        "content": "Jury selection began Monday in the murder trial of Lori Vallow, who is accused of killing two of her children, Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow and Tylee Ryan.  Vallow has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, conspiracy and grand theft in the deaths of Joshua and Tylee, who were 7 and 16 when they disappeared in September 2019. Their disappearance sparked a monthslong search, and police eventually found their remains on property in rural Idaho belonging to their stepfather, Vallow\u2019s husband, Chad Daybell.  Daybell, who also pleaded not guilty, is to have a separate trial that hasn\u2019t yet been scheduled. He is charged with murder in the death of his late wife, Tammy Daybell, and accused of committing insurance fraud related to her death.  Vallow is charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of Tammy Daybell. Vallow's trial comes years after Joshua and Tylee\u2019s disappearance made headlines, as the indictment against her and Daybell took months of investigative work and Vallow\u2019s mental competency was questioned.  Prosecutors believe Vallow and Daybell became obsessed with doomsday-focused religious beliefs that led them to commit a series of four murders: those of Vallow\u2019s children and each of their former spouses. Tylee and Joshua reported missing The Rexburg Police Department formally began a search for Tylee and Joshua in November 2019, after several family members contacted authorities concerned that they hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to the children since September.  Vallow and her husband told officers that Joshua was in Arizona with a family friend, which police said was a lie. Officers tried to conduct a welfare check on the children on Nov. 26, 2019, but were unable to find them. Addresses associated with Vallow were searched under warrants the next day, just as investigators learned that she and Daybell had abruptly left Rexburg. Vallow and Daybell hadn\u2019t cooperated with the investigation, and by December 2019 they were wanted for questioning in the children\u2019s disappearance.  Police warned that the children could be in danger and put out descriptions. Joshua, 7, had brown hair and brown eyes and weighed about 50 pounds.  Tylee, 16, had blond hair and blue eyes and weighed 160 pounds at 5 feet tall. Joshua, who was adopted and had special needs, was last seen Sept. 23, 2019, at Kennedy Elementary School in Rexburg. The boy was the son of Charles Vallow\u2019s nephew. His grandparents Larry and Kay Woodcock offered a $20,000 reward in January 2020 for information on his whereabouts. They said they last spoke to Joshua in August 2019 on a FaceTime call that lasted less than a minute. Tylee would have turned 17 on Sept. 24, 2019, but it is believed she died before her birthday. Police said Vallow and Daybell falsely told a witness that Tylee had died a year before, as well as falsely said Tylee was attending a university.  Tylee's father was Vallow\u2019s third husband, Joseph Ryan. He died of a heart attack in 2018 and had been in a bitter custody battle with Vallow over Tylee.  Keith Taniguchi, his former attorney, told NBC affiliate KSL of Salt Lake City that Vallow had accused Ryan of sexually abusing their daughter and that he had lost custody. Taniguchi said that there was an \u201cextensive\u201d analysis but that no evidence that Tylee had been abused was ever found.  Media attention unearths chilling allegations Authorities found Vallow and Daybell in Hawaii together in January 2020, without Tylee or Joshua, and ordered Vallow to physically produce the children to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare by the end of the month.  Vallow failed to abide by the order and was later arrested on charges of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children.  National attention quickly turned to Vallow and Daybell, unearthing troubling details about Vallow. Annie Cushing, Tylee\u2019s aunt and Joseph Ryan\u2019s sister, told KSL in a February 2020 interview that Vallow was disturbed and \"unhinged.\" In March 2020, East Idaho News obtained a court document, filed by the ex-husband of Vallow\u2019s niece, as part of their own custody battle, which included concern for Tylee and Joshua. Brandon Boudreaux alleged that his ex-wife, Melani Boudreaux Pawlowski, told him that Vallow and Daybell believed that \u201ctheir children had been possessed and have become zombies.\u201d \u201cShe shared concerns that she\u2019s been told Brandon needed to die and that may indicate that Tylee and JJ needed to die as well,\u201d the document alleges, referring to Joshua by his nickname. The filing described a cultlike religion that, in addition to zombies, included beliefs in teleportation and \u201cdark and light portals.\u201d Vallow\u2019s third husband and Tylee\u2019s father, Joseph Ryan, also expressed \u201creal and serious concerns\u201d in court documents in the midst of their divorce and custody battle. The documents said Vallow was ordered to undergo a psychological evaluation after she told social workers that \u201cdeath would be an option before giving Tylee to her father, Mr. Joseph Ryan, even for a visit.\u201d Ryan died of an apparent heart attack in 2018. Murder charges issued almost a year after children\u2019s remains were unearthed Police uncovered human remains in June 2020 after they searched a property belonging to Daybell in Fremont County, Idaho. Daybell was arrested on charges of destruction, alteration or concealment of evidence, as well as desertion. Days later, police confirmed that the bodies were identified as those of Joshua and Tylee.  \u201cIt is not the outcome we had hoped; to be able to find the children safe. Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of JJ and Tylee,\u201d Rexburg police said in a news release at the time. Police said they believed Daybell hid the children\u2019s remains on his property sometime from September 2019 to June 2020. Authorities also said the manner of concealment of one of the bodies was \u201cparticularly egregious.\u201d  Court documents later revealed that Joshua\u2019s remains had been buried in a pet cemetery, and that Tylee had been dismembered and burned in a fire pit.  Vallow and Daybell weren\u2019t indicted on murder charges until May 2021. Indictments said the couple \u201cdid endorse and espouse religious beliefs for the purpose of encouraging and/or justifying the homicides\u201d of Tammy, Tylee and Joshua. A month later, Vallow was charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Vallow's family has said she had long been obsessed with death and the afterlife, and that her marriage to Daybell, a doomsday evangelist and author, pushed her deeper into her beliefs. The deaths of two spouses revisited Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell began 2019 married to other people and ended it married to each other after their spouses died.  In early 2019, Vallow\u2019s fourth husband, Charles Vallow, called police to their Arizona home, concerned that she had \u201clost her mind.\u201d He told police that she had taken his car and locked him out of their home after he went on a business trip and that he had been unable to reach her for two days.  According to video obtained by NBC affiliate KPNX of Phoenix, Charles Vallow told police that his wife believed she was a god and that she believed someone had taken over his body.  \u201cShe\u2019s threatened me, to murder me, kill me,\u201d he said. \u201cShe lost her reality.\u201d \u201cHow does she pose a threat to your children?\u201d an officer asked Charles Vallow. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to do with them,\u201d Charles Vallow said. \u201cFlee with them. Hurt them.\u201d Police left after they told him that it wasn\u2019t a criminal case and that they weren\u2019t able to execute a mental health check on his wife at the time. She went to the police department hours later, telling officers that she had caught her husband cheating and that she told him not to come home.  Charles Vallow filed for divorce a few months before he was shot and killed by Lori Vallow\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, on July 11, 2019. Lori Vallow and her brother were questioned at the time but weren\u2019t charged, as they claimed self-defense.  A grand jury charged her with conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree nearly two years after his death, the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office said. She will be tried separately, in Arizona, in that case. Cox died in 2019 and was never charged.  In October 2019, a few months after Charles Vallow died, Tammy Daybell was also found dead of what were believed to be natural causes at the time. Investigators later exhumed her body and conducted an autopsy, which ruled her death was a homicide. Vallow and Daybell married just two weeks after Tammy\u2019s funeral, KSL reported. Police documents obtained by KSL revealed that Charles Vallow had learned of Lori Vallow\u2019s infidelity with Daybell 12 days before he died and threatened to tell Tammy.  Lori Vallow's trial is beginning more than three years after her children\u2019s deaths. Before the murder indictments were returned in May 2021, Vallow was ordered to undergo a mental competency evaluation and was declared unfit to stand trial on two counts of concealment in the deaths of her kids. A judge ordered her to be committed in June 2021 in the custody of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare for 90 days of treatment.  She was declared mentally fit to stand nearly a year later. In April 2022, Vallow was declared to be \u201crestored to competency and fit to proceed\u201d to trial. Idaho doesn\u2019t allow for an \u201cinsanity\u201d defense and requires that defendants have the competence to understand the charges against them.   Prosecutors have sought the death penalty against Vallow, but 7th District Judge Steven Boyce ruled against it last month. CORRECTION (April 4, 2023, 3:55 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated how long it took for Lori Vallow to speak to police after her former husband called for a wellness check in early 2019. It was hours later, not days later. CORRECTION (April 11, 2023, 12 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the marital status of Chad and Tammy Daybell when Tammy died in 2019.

        "title": "Hunter Biden pleads not guilty after plea deal is derailed",
        "content": "WILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to federal tax charges Wednesday after a plea deal he struck with the government unraveled when the judge raised questions about the terms of the agreement. The surprise development came at a hearing in federal court here at which Biden had been expected to plead guilty to two charges of failure to pay taxes under a deal he struck with the government last month. Far from signing off on a done deal, he pleaded \"not guilty\" to those charges instead until the two sides can meet and address the questions posed by U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika. At times, Noreika appeared almost upset that she believed she was being asked to act as a \"rubber stamp\" for the deal. The parties will reconvene later to hammer out the terms and provide Noreika more information, which could be within the next six weeks. \"Without me saying I'll agree to the plea agreement, how do you plead?\" Noreika asked Biden. \"Not guilty, your honor,\" he responded. Biden is expected to reverse his plea if a new agreement or the new information eventually satisfies Noreika. Noreika, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, pressed both sides about the terms of the agreement struck with U.S. Attorney David Weiss of Delaware, another Trump appointee, whom President Joe Biden kept on to oversee the case. She expressed clear concern about how two separate deals, one regarding the unpaid taxes and the other about a gun possession charge, potentially intersected, as well as her purview over them. Noreika quizzed the lawyers about whether the gun charge would be diverted until Biden fulfilled certain terms. The agreement would have her act as an arbiter if he violated the deal over 24 months. She said that she did not believe that the judiciary would normally oversee such an agreement and that it was the responsibility of the executive branch to bring charges. Biden's lawyer, Chris Clark, said that because of tremendous political \"Sturm and Drang\" surrounding the case, that element of the agreement would help ensure it \"wouldn't become more politicized\" if the government targeted Biden again in the future. While Noreika said she understood his argument, she said she worried that there was no case law to necessarily support the terms of the agreement. Noreika also said she worried that the agreement on the tax charges did not give her the authority to reject or modify the deal and that the gun charge agreement could shield Biden against further prosecution over his financial and tax issues. Though Noreika said it was possible all of those terms could be adopted, she wanted both sides to give her more information about their reasoning for her to study further. There were numerous points of disagreement and requests for clarification throughout the hearing, which had been expected to take a little over an hour but lasted well over three hours. At one point, Noreika asked whether the investigation was ongoing, to which Weiss responded that it was but said he could not share any further details. Noreika also raised a hypothetical, asking whether Biden could face charges of failing to register as a foreign agent and whether the agreement blocks his prosecution on such a charge. The defense said it believed the agreement would prohibit him from being charged, and the prosecution then disagreed. Clark was overheard telling a prosecutor, \"Then we'll rip it up,\" most likely in a reference to the plea deal, as they discussed the disagreement during a brief break before he eventually relented. In outlining the charges, Weiss\u2019 office said in an earlier statement that \u201cHunter Biden received taxable income in excess of $1,500,000 annually in calendar years 2017 and 2018. Despite owing in excess of $100,000 in federal income taxes each year, he did not pay the income tax due for either year.\u201d  The original deal included provisions that prosecutors would recommend probation for the tax violations, while a separate felony gun charge would be dropped if Biden met certain conditions laid out in court. It appears that now, the terms of his sentencing will be decided later.   Biden faced a separate gun charge, for illegally owning a Colt Cobra .38 Special handgun. He had conceivably reached a pretrial agreement about the issue that would delay the charges for 24 months, assuming he did not violate certain terms during that period \u2014 which included being added to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, no use of controlled substances or alcohol and no violations of local, state or federal laws. If he followed the agreement, the charge would be dropped, But there was some confusion about the gun charge, prompting the judge to pause Wednesday's proceedings so a resolution could be reached. The affair has consumed the U.S. political world, particularly Republicans. They have argued Biden has received preferential treatment because of his father, saying he should have been charged for some of his other business dealings. Trump, members of his family and his political allies have weighed in regularly with numerous allegations about his actions. While the deal brought an end to a sweeping five-year investigation that involved federal prosecutors, FBI agents and IRS officials, it is unlikely to hinder the deluge of political commentary. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre addressed the latest regarding the case at the start of her daily briefing Wednesday. Beyond a short statement, she referred all questions to the Justice Department and Biden's legal team. \"Hunter Biden is a private citizen, and this was a personal matter for him,\" she said. \"As we have said, the president, the first lady, they love their son, and they support him as he continues to rebuild his life. This case was handled independently, as all of you know, by the Justice Department under the leadership of a prosecutor appointed by the former president, President Trump.\" Hugh Hewitt, a conservative commentator, argued in The Washington Post on Tuesday that \u201cHunter Biden\u2019s doozy of a plea deal over tax and gun charges is ripe for rejection\u201d by Noreika, as it did not involve jail time. His argument runs parallel with that of many Republicans who criticized the deal as a slap on the wrist. The fallout is likely to please many on the right.   Republicans have questioned the investigation and threatened to impeach Attorney General Merrick Garland over how the Justice Department has handled the case. Their ire has grown steadily since two IRS whistleblowers involved in the investigation testified before Congress that there was meddling to benefit the president\u2019s son.  \u201cAt every stage, decisions were made that benefited the subject of this investigation,\u201d said Greg Shapley, one of the whistleblowers.  In response, Weiss offered Monday to testify publicly before Congress in a letter sent to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. He has disputed Jordan\u2019s claims, writing to him late last month that he was granted \u201cultimate authority\u201d in terms of \u201cwhere, when and whether to file charges.\u201d \u201cThe Department believes it is strongly in the public interest for the American people and for Congress to hear directly from U.S. Attorney Weiss on these assertions and questions about his authority at a public hearing,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Carlos Felipe Uriarte wrote in the letter, obtained by NBC News, which offered a handful of potential dates. The FBI also shared a memo with Republican oversight leaders in the House and the Senate that included unverified claims about Biden\u2019s time on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. The allegations, which remain uncorroborated, were part of a Justice Department review that Trump\u2019s then-attorney general, William Barr, launched in 2020. The probe was closed later that year.

        "content": "Jason Aldean defended his song \"Try That in a Small Town\" in Massachusetts over the weekend, comparing the tune's ethos to Bostonians who came together following the Boston Marathon bombings. Aldean was playing Saturday at the Xfinity Center in Mansfield, about 40 miles south of where the terrorist attack occurred on April 15, 2013, when he made the \"Small Town\"-to-Boston comparison. The song, and particularly its video, which has been pulled off Country Music Television, has come under fire as hostile toward civil rights and city dwellers. Aldean told fans he thought \"Small Town\" was \"a really cool song\" with a message that's been \"overshadowed by all the bulls---.\" \"I was lying in bed last night and I was thinking to myself, you guys would get this better than anybody, right? Because I remember a time, I think it was April 2013, when the Boston Marathon bombings happened, you guys remember this right?\" he asked the audience. \"The last time that happened was a whole, not a small town, a big-ass town came together, no matter your color, no matter anything. No matter if you\u2019re anything. The whole country and especially Boston came together to find\" the people responsible for the bombings. Bombs made from pressure cookers were planted at the finish line by brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, supporters of Chechen independence, killing three people and injuring more than 260. The fatally wounded were Boston University grad student Lu Lingzi, 23; restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29; and 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was watching the marathon with his family. The older brother, Tamerlan, 26, died days after the bombing from injuries suffered in a shootout with police and when Dzhokhar ran him over in his escape. Dzhokhar, 19 at the time, was captured hours later hiding in a backyard in Watertown. \"And anybody, any of you guys that would\u2019ve found those guys before the cops did, I know you guys from Boston, and you guys would\u2019ve beat the s--- out of them, either one of \u2018em,\" Aldean told the crowd Saturday.  \"And I\u2019ve been trying to say, this is not about race, it\u2019s about people getting their s--- together and acting right, acting like you\u2019ve got some common sense.\" Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 30, was convicted on all 30 counts against him and was sentenced to death. Defense lawyers are appealing that punishment. Peter Norden, who had two nephews lose legs in the attack, said he doesn't believe Aldean's song had any ill intent. \"I don't have any problem using that (the 2013 attack) as an example (of a rallying community),\" Norden, 60, told NBC News on Monday. \"I didn't take offense to it at all. If I would have taken offense to a song like that, then why wouldn't I take offense to some of the songs that really degrade women?\" Others with Boston-related social media feeds were not as forgiving. \"Mansfield, Massachusetts is also quite far from Boston. This guy is a hack of a songwriter, trying to make himself relevant,\" one netizen wrote. \"I wonder if Jason Aldean would dare say this to Martin Richard\u2019s family, who run an organization that promotes peace and nonviolence.\"  ",

        "title": "Anti-abortion rights group slams Ron DeSantis on his failure to back a national ban",
        "content": "An anti-abortion rights group sharply criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday for failing to embrace a national abortion ban, an issue that has divided the GOP presidential primary field.  DeSantis did not directly answer whether he would support a federal ban on abortion in a recent interview on the Megyn Kelly show. He pledged to be a \u201cpro-life president,\u201d but said, \u201cWe are running on doing things that I know I can accomplish.\u201d \u201cBut I really believe, right now in our society, it\u2019s really a bottom-up movement and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve had most success \u2014 Iowa, South Carolina, Florida,\u201d DeSantis later added. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re going to continue to see a lot of good battles there.\u201d Asked if he does not support a federal law banning abortion, DeSantis said, \u201cI\u2019ll always come down on the side of life. I\u2019m proud to be pro-life, and I\u2019ll be a pro-life president.\u201d  His comments drew the ire of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion rights group that has pushed GOP presidential hopefuls to support a national ban on abortion.  The group\u2019s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said in a statement that there is \u201ca clear consensus for protecting babies in the womb at least by the point they can feel pain at 15 weeks, while allowing states to enact stronger protections.\u201c \u201cThe pro-life movement and the American people deserve a president who will boldly advocate this consensus and will work to gather the votes necessary in Congress,\u201d Dannenfelser said. \u201cGov. DeSantis\u2019s dismissal of this task is unacceptable to prolife voters.\u201d DeSantis has not taken a clear position on a federal ban after signing a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy in Florida. In a CNN interview this month, DeSantis also did not directly answer whether he would support a national prohibition, broadly saying he \u201cwill support pro-life policies.\u201d \u201cGovernor DeSantis delivers results and acts, especially when it comes to protecting life. He did so in Florida by signing the heartbeat bill and will be a pro-life president. He does not kowtow to DC interest groups,\" Bryan Griffin, DeSantis' campaign press secretary, said in a statement. \"This unjustified attack on him is another example of the DC political games that have seen conservatives falter in Washington while Governor DeSantis has produced unmatched conservative victories in Florida,\u201d Griffin added. The clash isn\u2019t the first time SBA Pro-Life America has weighed in on the presidential race. The group also chastised former President Donald Trump when a campaign spokesman said Trump believed the issue should be decided at the state level.  Dannenfelser called that \u201ca morally indefensible position\u201d and said the group would oppose any presidential candidate who did not support a 15-week federal ban.  Dannenfelser later met with Trump and described the meeting as \u201cterrific.\u201d She said in a statement that the former president \u201creiterated that any federal legislation protecting these children would need to include the exceptions for life of the mother and in cases of rape and incest.\u201d",

        "title": "Carlos De Oliveira has no Florida lawyer in Trump classified docs case",
        "content": "MIAMI \u2014 The Mar-a-Lago property manager charged in a new indictment alongside Donald Trump in the alleged mishandling of classified government documents after the former president left office was unable to enter a plea in court on Monday after being unable to secure a Florida-based lawyer. Carlos De Oliveira, 56, wearing a navy suit and glasses, entered the Miami court just after 10 a.m., accompanied by his attorney John Irving. It was the first sighting of De Oliveira, who stands about 5'8\" with salt and pepper hair, since last week\u2019s superseding indictment in the special counsel's documents case. The judge read the four charges against De Oliveira and his rights before setting the signature bond at $100,000. Because De Oliveira has not secured local counsel to represent him in Florida, he was asked to return for his arraignment next month. \u201cWe\u2019re working on ascertaining local counsel,\u201d Irving told NBC News ahead of the hearing. The defense had asked for more time to secure counsel for De Oliveira before agreeing to return on Aug. 10 before a judge in Fort Pierce, about an hour north of where De Oliveira lives. De Oliveira stood with Irving listening as the attorney spoke with the court marshal and as reporters filed out. Prosecutors charge that De Oliveira attempted to delete surveillance footage at the former president\u2019s Palm Beach club after the Justice Department sought to obtain it.  But without a lawyer who can practice in Florida, Irving said he didn\u2019t think the judge would proceed with De Oliveira\u2019s arraignment. Irving said it would depend on the judge, raising the prospect of delays in the case. De Oliveira has been summoned to appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Edwin Torres, who presided over the arraignment of Walt Nauta, Trump\u2019s personal aide who is also indicted in the classified documents case. Nauta\u2019s not guilty plea was twice postponed because of difficulties in hiring local counsel. De Oliveira, a former maintenance worker who had climbed the ranks at Mar-a-Lago for more than a decade, was a little-known aide at the club before being named a co-conspirator alongside Trump and Nauta in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s updated indictment unsealed on Thursday. Asked about De Oliveira after the federal indictment was unsealed Thursday, one person close to Trump responded, \u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d  Filed in the Southern District of Florida, the updated indictment lays out new charges against Trump, Nauta, and, now, De Oliveira, who are accused of conspiring to thwart federal investigators\u2019 efforts to retrieve sensitive classified documents from Trump in his post-presidency.  According to court documents, De Oliveira told another employee at Trump\u2019s Palm Beach club that \u201cthe boss\u201d wanted surveillance footage deleted, a conversation that took place after Trump\u2019s attorneys received a subpoena to turn over the recordings. De Oliveira is also accused of making false statements to prosecutors, including the assertion that he \u201cnever saw anything\u201d when asked whether he was involved with moving boxes of classified materials. Aides to Trump appear to voice concern about De Oliveira's loyalty to the former president. Speaking to another employee, Nauta \u201csaid words to the effect of, \u2018someone just wants to make sure Carlos is good,\u2019\u201d according to the indictment. In a Signal message to Nauta and another aide to Trump, who is described as a representative for his political action committee, the employee responds that De Oliveira is \u201cloyal.\u201d That same day, \u201cTrump called De Oliveira and told De Oliveira that Trump would get De Oliveira an attorney,\u201d the indictment says.",

        "title": "Idaho mom Lori Vallow guilty of murdering two kids: Jury",
        "content": "Lori Vallow, the Idaho mother accused of killing two of her children and conspiring to kill her husband\u2019s first wife, was convicted on all charges Friday, ending a weekslong murder trial that heard about evil spirits, zombies and doomsday prophecies. The jury in Boise unanimously reached its decision. Vallow was charged with murder, conspiracy and grand theft in the deaths of Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 16. She stood next to her attorneys as the verdict was read and remained silent. Joshua and Tylee vanished in September 2019. Their disappearance sparked a monthslong search that ended in June 2020 when police found their remains on a property belonging to Vallow's fifth and current husband, Chad Daybell. Daybell was arrested and charged with murder and conspiracy in connection with the children's deaths. He will have a separate trial that has not been scheduled yet. Witnesses have testified that the couple were deeply involved in a doomsday belief system, claiming they were seeing \"zombies\" and demonic possession all around them. They are also both charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the death of Daybell's first wife, Tammy Daybell. He faces additional charges of murder and insurance fraud. They have both pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Prosecutors and defense paint very different pictures of Vallow The prosecution described Vallow as a woman who would \"remove any obstacle in her way\" and would use \"money, power, and sex to get what she wanted.\" \"It didn\u2019t matter what it was,\" Fremont County Prosecutor Lindsey Blake told jurors at the beginning of the trial. She said that Tylee, Joshua and Tammy Daybell were all killed because they got in the way of Vallow and Daybell's relationship. \"Remember, the defendant will remove any obstacle in her way to get what she wants, and she wanted Chad Daybell,\" Blake said. Vallow's defense team, however, argued that she is a \"kind and loving mother to her children\" who happened to take an interest in religion and biblical prophecies about the end of the world. \"Some people care less about biblical prophecies, some people care a lot about it. Thankfully in this country, we get to worship as we choose,\" defense attorney Jim Archibald said. He told the jurors that based on the charges \u2014 which accuse Vallow of either directing, encouraging, assisting or participating in the murders \u2014 it shows that prosecutors do not really know what happened. \"Did she kill or did she assist or did she encourage or did she direct? They aren\u2019t sure,\" he said. Witnesses describe zombie claims, finding remains Idaho police started investigating Vallow and Daybell, a doomsday author, in November 2019 after family members reported the two children missing. The couple refused to cooperate with the investigation and left the state; they were later found in Hawaii and extradited to Idaho. Authorities would find remains of the children on Daybell's property in Fremont County, Idaho. Court documents said that Joshua, who was adopted and had special needs, was buried in a pet cemetery, and that Tylee\u2019s remains were dismembered and burned in a fire pit. Throughout the trial, several witnesses took the stand for the prosecution. The defense did not call any witnesses and Vallow chose not to testify. Rexburg police detective Ray Hermosillo told jurors that Joshua's arms were visibly bruised after his partially decomposed body was found buried near a tree. The child, wearing red pajamas and socks, had duct tape covering his mouth and binding his arms and legs together. Black plastic covered his remains. Hair belonging to Vallow was found on a piece of duct tape used to wrap the boy, a DNA analyst testified. Tylee's remains had been destroyed and burned, packed into a melted green bucket and buried elsewhere on the property, according to the detective. Another witness to take the stand was Vallow's former friend, Melanie Gibb. Vallow tried to use Gibb as her alibi and told police investigating the children's disappearance that Joshua was visiting her in Arizona. Gibb told the court that Vallow believed some people were \"zombies\" or possessed by evil spirits, including her two younger children and her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. Joshua was the grandnephew of Charles Vallow, who along with Lori Vallow adopted the child. Charles Vallow was shot and killed at his Arizona home by Vallow's brother, Alex Cox, in July 2019. Cox \u2014 who died in 2019 of what was reported as natural causes \u2014 claimed it was self-defense. But in 2021, Vallow was indicted on a charge of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in Charles Vallow's death. She has not yet had the opportunity to enter a plea in that case. Gibb said that after Charles Vallow's death, Vallow had a hard time taking care of Joshua and felt that she did not have enough time with Daybell. The family moved from Arizona to Idaho, Gibb testified, and that's when Vallow began claiming that Joshua was possessed. Colby Ryan, Vallow's adult son, also testified and suggested that someone pretending to be Tylee would send him text messages from her phone after she disappeared. He told jurors that she regularly texted him and that the tone and punctuation of the messages changed after his sister vanished, but before she was reported missing. Jurors also heard a recorded phone conversation of Ryan confronting his mother. He accused her of murdering his siblings, Joshua and Tylee, and then lying to him. \"To know that they\u2019re gone, and you knew! And my phone is being texted by my little sister, who\u2019s not even alive!\" Ryan said. \"My poor brother, who is the sweetest little kid ever \u2014 for what purpose? You tell me this is God\u2019s will: For my whole family, including my stepfather, to be dead.\" In the call, Vallow denied killing the children and told Ryan that everything would become clear in the afterlife. Testimony about Tammy Daybell's bruises and time of death The trial also focused on the 2019 death of Tammy Daybell. Prosecutors said Vallow was already in a relationship with Daybell while he was still married to Tammy Daybell and moved to eastern Idaho to be closer to him. Daybell and Vallow married weeks after Tammy Daybell died.  Utah\u2019s chief medical examiner, Dr. Erik Christensen, testified that bruises were discovered on Tammy Daybell's body and that she may have been restrained when she died, according to NBC affiliate KSL of Salt Lake City. He also said he believes she died hours before Daybell reported her death, the news station reported. Her death was initially considered to be of natural causes, but authorities had her body exhumed and an autopsy determined it was a homicide and that she died of asphyxiation.",

        "title": "Idaho mom Lori Vallow to be sentenced in deaths of her 2 children and romantic rival",
        "content": "ST. ANTHONY, Idaho \u2014 Idaho mother Lori Vallow faces up to life in prison without parole Monday as she is sentenced in the murders of her two youngest children and a romantic rival in a case that included bizarre claims that her son and daughter were zombies and that she was a goddess sent to usher in the Biblical apocalypse. Vallow was found guilty in May of killing her two youngest children, 7-year-old Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan, as well as conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell, her fifth husband\u2019s previous wife. The husband, Chad Daybell, is awaiting trial on the same murder charges. Vallow also faces two other cases in Arizona \u2014 one on a charge of conspiring with her brother to kill her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and one of conspiring to kill her niece\u2019s ex-husband. Charles Vallow was shot and killed in 2019, but her niece\u2019s ex survived an attempt later that year. Monday\u2019s sentencing will take place at the Fremont County Courthouse in St. Anthony, Idaho. Judge Steven W. Boyce is expected to hear testimony from several representatives of the victims, including Vallow's only surviving son, Colby Ryan. The case began in July 2019, when Vallow's brother, Alex Cox, shot and killed her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, in a suburban Phoenix home. Cox told police he acted in self-defense. He was never charged in the case and died later that year of what authorities determined were natural causes. Vallow was already in a relationship with Chad Daybell, a self-published author who wrote doomsday-focused fiction loosely based on Mormon teachings. She moved to Idaho with her kids and brother to be closer to him. The children were last seen alive in September 2019. Police discovered they were missing a month later after an extended family member became worried. Their bodies were found buried in Chad Daybell\u2019s yard the following summer. Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow married in November 2019, about two weeks after Daybell\u2019s previous wife, Tammy, was killed. Tammy Daybell initially was described as having died of natural causes, but an autopsy later showed she had been asphyxiated, authorities said. Defense attorney Jim Archibald argued during the trial that there was no evidence tying Vallow to the killings, but plenty showing she was a loving, protective mother whose life took a sharp turn when she met Chad Daybell and fell for his \u201cweird\u201d apocalyptic religious claims. He suggested that Daybell and Vallow's brother, Alex Cox, were responsible for the deaths. Daybell told her they had been married in several previous lives and she was a \u201csexual goddess\u201d who was supposed to help him save the world by gathering 144,000 followers so Jesus could return, Archibald said. Vallow's former friend Melanie Gibb testified during the trial that Vallow believed people in her life had been taken over by evil spirits and turned into \u201czombies,\u201d including JJ and Tylee.",

        "content": "A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit Donald Trump filed against CNN in which the former U.S. president claimed that references in news articles or by the network\u2019s hosts to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election as \u201cthe Big Lie\u201d was tantamount to comparing him to Adolf Hitler. Trump had been seeking punitive damages of $475 million in the federal lawsuit filed last October in South Florida, claiming the references hurt his reputation and political career. Trump is a candidate for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination in what is his third run for the presidency. U.S. District Judge Raag Singhal, who was appointed by Trump, said Friday in his ruling that the former president\u2019s defamation claims failed because the references were opinions and not factual statements. Moreover, it was a stretch to believe that, in viewers\u2019 minds, that phrase would connect Trump\u2019s efforts challenging the 2020 election results to Nazi propaganda or Hitler\u2019s genocidal and authoritarian regime, the judge said. \u201cCNN\u2019s use of the phrase \u2018the Big Lie\u2019 in connection with Trump\u2019s election challenges does not give rise to a plausible inference that Trump advocates the persecution and genocide of Jews or any other group of people,\u201d the judge wrote in his decision. Email messages seeking comment were sent to Trump\u2019s attorneys in South Florida and Washington. CNN declined to comment on Sunday.",

        "content": "ROCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis unveiled his economic agenda on Monday, interspersing a mix of traditional conservative talking points with pledges to use government power to go after large corporations that promote socially conscious investing or diversity initiatives. Speaking before about 100 people inside the warehouse of a local logistics company, DeSantis detailed his alignment with longtime conservative policy positions like cutting taxes, the size of government, spending and regulations, as well as boosting domestic energy production, GDP growth and immigration enforcement. But DeSantis also zoomed in on reducing economic ties with China, eliminating trade deficits, taking on corporations for hiring and investing practices not aligned with his brand of politics \u2014 similar to his longstanding battle with Disney \u2014 and ending what he described as President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cwar on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\u201d In announcing his \u201cDeclaration of Economic Independence,\u201d DeSantis derided \u201celites\u201d roughly a dozen times while pledging to \u201creject the technocratic management of American decline.\u201d \u201cWe cannot have a policy that kowtows to the largest corporations on Wall Street at the expense of small businesses and average Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between a free-market economy, which we want, and corporatism, in which the rules are configured to be able to help the incumbent companies.\u201d Currently the No. 2 candidate in GOP primary polling behind Donald Trump, DeSantis is trying to make up a growing gap between him and the former president. His campaign earlier this month, as NBC News reported, pledged a reset for the candidate that would include smaller events, more engagement with a variety of media sources and less of a focus on Florida. But the Sunshine State took center stage in promoting his economic vision. DeSantis promoted Florida's promising business rankings, its substantial economic growth in recent years and his having run budget surpluses at the state level. (Not mentioned was a rate of inflation in the state\u2019s major metro areas that far outpaces the national average.) \u201cWe beat the elites and we showed the way forward to restore freedom and opportunity for people all throughout this country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I will fight as president for the American people just like we fought for the people of Florida.\u201d DeSantis sought to portray a nation in decline facing dire economic straits at a time when inflation \u2014 which remains thorny \u2014 fell to 3% last month, the 12th straight month of declines, led by declining gas prices. What\u2019s more, the unemployment rate has hovered around 3.5% for much of the year while the S&P 500 is up almost 20% since January, nearly hitting its all-time peak from the end of December 2021. DeSantis pointed to an increased number of men leaving the workforce and a desire \u201cto be a country where a family or we can raise a family on one sole income.\" \u201cWe are a nation with an economy, not the other way around,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are citizens of a republic. We are not cogs in a global economic empire.\u201d DeSantis saved some of his strongest language to call out companies that are promoting ESG investing, which stands for environmental, social and governance, as a way to \u201cadvance an ideological or political agenda\u201d that circumvents the government. He also highlighted the recent Supreme Court ruling knocking down affirmative action programs in education as a template to go after diversity initiatives in the private sector. \u201cThat ruling should apply across the board for our economy and the so-called DEI programs that many corporations have embraced,\u201d he said, using the acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion. \u201cThose are discriminatory programs. If they have you go through a training and say somehow you have white privilege, that is [as] wrong as judging somebody based on the color of their skin.\u201d Some conservatives have expressed qualms about DeSantis\u2019 effort to target private companies for such decision making. A New York Times/Siena College survey published Monday found that a majority of Republicans would be more likely to support a candidate who \u201csays the government should stay out of deciding what corporations can do\u201d rather than a candidate \u201cwho promises to fight corporations that promote a \u2018woke\u2019 left ideology.\u201d DeSantis, as he mocked degrees in \u201cGender Studies\u201d and \u201cZombie Studies,\u201d also pointed to a wide-ranging education platform he tied directly to the economy, including a call for universities to be responsible for the student debt of graduates who are unable to find well-paying jobs. \u201cYou produce somebody that can be successful, they pay off their loans,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, then you\u2019re going to be on the hook. That will cause a change in the type of course programs that a lot of these universities are offering. They\u2019re not going to afford to be doing ideological studies because they know that\u2019s not going to lead to gainful employment.\u201d During a question-and-answer session with reporters, DeSantis was pressed on how his call for increased American energy production clashes with his efforts in Florida to prevent offshore drilling there. He said he was merely honoring a state constitutional amendment that did not allow for such drilling and that he does not think that should apply nationally. \u201cBecause we\u2019re a coastal state, we\u2019ve had oil spills,\u201d he said. \u201cWe put that in the Constitution, our voters did, and that\u2019s something as governor that I\u2019ve followed and respected.\u201d Jim Tobin, a voter from Madbury, New Hampshire, who plans to vote for DeSantis in the first-in-the-nation primary, said Monday was the first time he saw the candidate in person. He said he was excited about DeSantis' policy agenda and feels the candidate has less \"baggage\" than Trump, whom DeSantis is currently \"getting killed\" by in surveys. \"I love his ideas,\" Tobin said of the governor. \"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a polarizing figure the way the media is making him out to be. I\u2019ve seen people get on the news and say he\u2019s a joke. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s a joke. He\u2019s a serious guy. His education, his military background \u2014 there\u2019s no way he\u2019s a joke.\"",

        "title": "FISA Section 702: What it is and why Congress is debating it",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden administration faces an uphill battle to reauthorize a key surveillance tool, known as Section 702, before it expires at the end of the year as members of both parties of Congress push for big changes. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, allows the government to conduct targeted surveillance of foreign nationals living outside the U.S. without needing to obtain a warrant. It has become increasingly controversial over the years. As recently as this month, a court opinion disclosed that FBI employees wrongly searched foreign surveillance data for the last names of a U.S. senator and a state senator. The opinion also said that another FBI employee ran a query using the Social Security number of a state judge who complained about alleged civil rights violations by a municipal chief of police. Critics of Section 702 worry that its powers are too broad and allow for the \"incidental\" collection of data on U.S. citizens and that the provision is ripe for abuse. What is Section 702 and how are Americans affected? Section 702 was created following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and allows intelligence agencies to gather large amounts of data such as emails, phone calls, texts and other communications on foreigners living abroad, without a warrant. As the provision currently stands, intelligence agencies cannot use warrantless Section 702 powers to target Americans, because that would violate the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. But data on U.S. citizens is still collected when they interact with a foreign surveillance target \u2014 that's known as \u201cincidental\u201d collection. Civil liberties organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, have long opposed the the 702 provision, arguing that it has been used as a \"backdoor\" tool for gathering information on Americans and allows federal law enforcement to prosecute and imprison people for crimes, even if they\u2019re not related to national security, based on information obtained without a warrant. The FBI improperly searched for information in a U.S. database of foreign intelligence more than 278,000 times in 2020 and early 2021, including Americans involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and those who participated in the 2020 protests following the murder of George Floyd, a court order showed. The government says it uses the information to protect the U.S. and its allies from hostile foreign adversaries, such as terrorists, weapons dealers and spies. And the Biden administration has urged Congress to renew it, arguing that it is a necessary measure to keep Americans safe. According to a senior intelligence official, nearly 60% of the information in President Joe Biden\u2019s presidential daily brief includes at least some information derived from Section 702. The FBI has made recent changes to Section 702 to curb abuses and the White House on Monday released a report by the President\u2019s Intelligence Advisory Board, which voted unanimously to support its reauthorization, while also recommending 13 reforms to address past mishandling. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer said in a statement that Section 702 has allowed the U.S. to stop threats posed by China, Russia, terrorists and fentanyl traffickers. \u201cWe agree with the unanimous conclusion reached by this group of independent, deeply experienced experts that failure to reauthorize Section 702 could be 'one of the worst intelligence failures of our time,'\" they said, quoting the report. How do Democrats and Republicans view Section 702?  While there has been bipartisan support for Section 702 in the past, recent errors and misuses of it, as well as the current climate of skepticism toward intelligence agencies, has made its reauthorization far more challenging.  While Republicans supported Section 702 when it was created during the Bush administration, recent Republican criticism of the FBI for the investigation of former President Donald Trump and errors made during the probe of Russian ties to his 2016 presidential campaign have made way for steep opposition. The provision has also faced opposition from Democrats who worry that it may hinder Americans\u2019 civil liberties. Lawmakers from both sides have said they won\u2019t vote to renew the provision unless major changes are made in how the FBI uses foreign surveillance data to investigate Americans. \u201cI will only support the reauthorization of Section 702 if there are significant, significant reforms,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said during a hearing in June. \"And that means first and foremost addressing the warrantless surveillance of Americans in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who has long pushed for changes to Section 702, said at the same hearing he was skeptical that federal law enforcement would use the power properly without new guardrails placed on it. \u201cWhy should we ever trust the FBI and the DOJ again to police themselves under FISA, when they\u2019ve shown us repeatedly, for more than a decade, that they cannot be trusted to do so?\u201d Twenty-one privacy, civil rights and civil liberties organizations submitted a joint letter to the Senate last month demanding that Congress not reauthorize Section 702 without such \"reforms\" as imposing warrant requirements to \"spy\" on Americans and instituting a stronger judicial review process and safeguards for foreign targets who are unlikely to be involved in threats to national security.  Patrick Toomey, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s National Security Project, said in a statement that recent revelations of abuses \u2014 including that the FBI searched Section 702 data for the last names of a U.S. senator, a state senator and a judge \u2014 show how the surveillance program \u201cis routinely used against Americans, immigrants, and people who are not accused of any wrongdoing. \u201cThe FBI continues to break the rules put in place to protect Americans, running illegal searches on public officials including a U.S. senator, and it\u2019s long past time for Congress to step in,\" Toomey said. How has the FBI responded to criticism? The FBI has introduced changes in recent years that have led to \u201csignificant improvement,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement this month, adding that \u201cSection 702 is critical in our fight against foreign adversaries.\u201d As a result, FBI searches for data on Americans plummeted. According to a report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the number of FBI searches for citizens' data dropped 94% between November 2021 and November 2022, from 3.4 million to about 204,000. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing this month, Wray defended the provision and touted recent changes, saying, \u201cWe have had problems. And those problems are unacceptable and I\u2019m determined with my leadership team to fix them. But those problems, almost entirely, predate those reforms.\u201d What happens next? Congress has to act before the end of the year when Section 702 expires. Members of both parties have pushed for major changes and have held committee hearings in preparation. The last time Section 702 was renewed, in 2018, about one-third of members in the House and Senate voted against it.",

        "title": "Spain identifies 212 German, Austrian and Dutch fighters who went missing during Spanish Civil War",
        "content": "Spanish government researchers said Sunday they had identified 357 foreign fighters who went missing during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), the conflict that foreshadowed World War II. Researchers confirmed the names of 212 fighters from Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, according to a statement from the government Sunday. Some 102 are of German origin, 70 Austrian and 40 Dutch. It gave no information on how many people of other nationalities had been identified. The identified combatants fought within the International Brigades, military units set up by the Communist International to fight against General Francisco Franco\u2019s fascist forces. Some 40,000 foreign men and women joined up as volunteers, fighting alongside the forces of the democratic Second Spanish Republic and against the rise of fascism in Europe in late 1930s. The findings are based on a year of research in records held in documentary archives in Spain and Russia. Researchers combed through the daily lists of casualties and missing soldiers compiled by officers in the International Brigades. The names of private soldiers were frequently omitted from the lists, making the research process more difficult. These lists are held in the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History, in Moscow. Researchers also dipped into the main archives on the Spanish Civil War located in Spain. By cross-referencing documents, researchers were also able to identify the likely area where the soldiers died or were badly wounded. It is an important step toward locating their remains inside mass graves scattered across the country. This research provides \u201cvery valuable information that gives us the opportunity to contact the families of the missing combatants and, in the future, to intervene in the mass graves that have been located,\u201d said Alfons Aragoneses, head of the project. All those identified were part of the Th\u00e4lmann Brigade, a Communist unit made up largely of anti-Nazi Germans. The battalion was active on the Ebro River front in northeastern Spain between March and September 1938, the site of the longest and deadliest battle of the war. The research is ongoing and it is funded by Catalan regional government, with the aim of contributing to the country\u2019s historical memory. The second phase of the project will try to identify missing militiamen from Great Britain, Ireland, Canada and the United States. The final step would require opening the graves in search of bodies. Historians estimate nearly 10,000 foreign volunteers died in combat on Spanish soil during the war. How many are still unidentified, buried inside graves, remains unknown. The Spanish Civil War served as a testing ground for Hitler\u2019s Germany and Mussolini\u2019s Italy prior to World War II. This triggered an international outcry to try to save the Republic\u2019s democratic government, which eventually succumbed to Franco in 1939.",

The attack was reported at 6:30 p.m. Saturday, and the injuries were minor enough that the child, identified by a park spokesperson as a boy, was hospitalized only for evaluation, it said. The big cat was being sought by park service personnel, who plan to euthanize it under longstanding guidelines, the park service said. \"Olympic National Park has extensive protocols in place for wildlife observations, interactions, and attacks and the lethal removal of this cougar is in line with these protocols,\" it said. The area of the attack, Lake Angeles, was evacuated, campers there were made to leave, and access was closed until further notice, the park service said. Adjacent Heather Park was also closed, it said. The park, near the U.S.-Canada border, is about 85 miles northwest of Seattle. If the cougar is captured and killed, park service officials will order a necropsy \u2014 an autopsy for animals \u2014 in a quest to find clues about its state at the time of the attack, the park service said. Interactions with humans, let alone attacks, are uncommon, and the reclusive big cats are a rare sight, it said. Interaction does happen, however: Olympic National Park is cougar territory, the park service said. \"If you meet a cougar, it is important to not run because it could trigger the cougar\u2019s attack instinct,\" it said. \"People should group together, appear as large as possible, keep eyes on the animal, make lots of noise and shout loudly.\"",

        "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told NBC News his country is not heading toward civil war, a specter raised by Israel\u2019s president amid the deep divisions and mass protests following new legislation that severely weakens the Supreme Court. \u201cThere won\u2019t be civil war, I guarantee you that,\u201d Netanyahu said during an interview Monday. \u201cWhen the dust settles, people will see this was necessary.\u201d  In a wide-ranging interview one week after his law passed through parliament, Netanyahu also defended the presence of far-right ministers in his Cabinet after criticism from President Joe Biden and said a potential U.S.-brokered peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia would be \u201ca pivot of history.\u201d Netanyahu has faced six months of unprecedented mass protests by demonstrators who believe that, by weakening the Supreme Court, he is removing one of the few checks on the government\u2019s power and is endangering Israeli democracy. The prime minister argues he is carefully rebalancing Israel\u2019s three branches of government to move power away from unelected judges, who he says have taken too much authority for themselves, and back into the hands of elected politicians. The argument has left Israel deeply divided, with President Isaac Herzog warning in March of the danger of \u201ca real civil war.\u201d A poll published last week by Israel\u2019s Channel 13 found 56% of Israelis worried their country\u2019s political crisis could escalate into civil war. Netanyahu acknowledged the divisions but said he believed the recent legislation \u2014 which removes the court\u2019s ability to strike down government actions as \u201cunreasonable\u201d \u2014 was \u201cworth it.\u201d \u201cI think people\u2019s fears that have been stoked and whipped up, I think, will subside, and they\u2019ll see that Israel is just as democratic as it was before and even more democratic,\u201d he said. Demonstrators, Israeli opposition parties and close allies have said they fear the new legislation is merely the first step on a slippery slope away from democracy in Israel.  In an interview with CNN in early July,  Biden criticized the presence of far-right politicians in Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet, calling them some of \u201cthe most extremist members\u201d he had ever seen. Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir was convicted in 2007 of inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organization. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich earlier this year called for a Palestinian village to be \u201cwiped out\u201d \u2014 a comment he later apologized for after criticism by the United States.  Netanyahu\u2019s new comments come after months of demonstrations against efforts by his government, the most right-wing ever, to overhaul the judiciary and limit the Supreme Court\u2019s power.  Himself on trial in three corruption cases, the Israeli prime minister dismissed allegations that his legal woes had motivated the judicial changes, calling the claims \u201cnonsense.\u201d Still, his government\u2019s effort has roiled Israel, with businesses closing in solidarity with the protesters and former senior officials openly opposing the moves. A significant number of military reservists have joined the protests, an alarming development for the nation\u2019s national security. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate that you\u2019ve had reservists that are being lined up for something that involves a political debate,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding that their involvement \u201cpoliticizes the military.\u201d  The three parts of the reform plan are removing the \u201creasonability test,\u201d the elimination of the override clause, and changing how judges are appointed. The first part of the package of bills passed July 24 and removes justices\u2019 rights to overrule Cabinet ministers\u2019 decisions for being \u201cunreasonable.\u201d  \u201cThe way that reasonableness is done in Israel has no parallel in any democracy, not in America or in any other parliamentary democracy,\u201d said Netanyahu, who has been forced to vacate the appointment of a close ally who had criminal convictions because of that judiciary power. There two other proposed changes could soon come before the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.  The first would allow the Knesset to override any decision by the court with a simple majority, and the last part of the reform package would effectively give the ruling parties control over appointing judges. Judges in Israel currently are appointed by a panel that includes a mix of political appointees, lawmakers and members of the legal profession.  During the interview with NBC News, Netanyahu tried to quell fears that the judiciary changes had harmed the close relationship between the United States and Israel, which relies on Washington for military, security and intelligence cooperation.  \u201cI think that the relationship is sound,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the dust will settle, and, it\u2019ll turn out to be the case, through changing governments and administrations, Israel is the best ally of the United States and the United States is the irreplaceable ally of Israel.\u201d The judicial overhaul could still be overturned.  A good governance group has filed a petition to the court that has argued the judicial change was illegal and, ironically, it could be up to the judiciary to decide whether it can stand.
