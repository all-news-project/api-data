        "content": "One of Italy's most dangerous fugitives has been caught in Greece after a photo of him cheering on his football team gave away his whereabouts. Vincenzo La Porta, 60, is thought to have close ties to the Camorra organised crime gang in Naples. He has been on the run for 11 years - but earlier this year was spotted in a photo of fans celebrating in Greece. The Naples Carabinieri police said: \"What betrayed him was his passion for football and for the Napoli.\" Officers said the photos were taken after Napoli won its first Italian championship in over three decades earlier this year. \"With the championship victory, La Porta couldn't resist celebrating,\" police said. La Porta has already been convicted in absentia in Italy for criminal association, tax evasion and fraud. Police finally arrested him on Friday while he was riding his moped on the Greek island of Corfu and he is now currently in a jail awaiting extradition to Italy. If he is extradited to Italy, he is due serve a prison sentence of 14 years and four months. La Porta's lawyer told AP news agency: \"He has started a new family in Greece... He has a nine-year-old boy and is working as a cook to get by. He suffers from heart ailments. If he's extradited, he and his family will be ruined.\" The authorities were relentless in their pursuit of La Porta, tracking his financial and online movements closely and \"waited for him to make a misstep\". Back in May, La Porta could not contain his excitement when Napoli won its first Serie A title after 33 years. The police spotted him in a photo outside a Corfu restaurant among Napoli fans donning a baseball cap and waving the team's sky blue and white colours. The investigators knew they had their man and followed him to Greece. With a little help from their Greek colleagues, they arrested him on Friday, the Greek police said. In January, this year, an Italian mafia boss who was on the run for decades was arrested after a Google Maps sighting.",

        "title": "Israeli security forces kill three Palestinians in West Bank",
        "content": "Israeli security forces say they have killed three alleged Palestinian militants in the north of the occupied West Bank, near the Jenin refugee camp. The camp was the focus of a major military operation last month. It marks a further escalation in a wave of violence over the weekend. On Friday, armed Jewish settlers attacked a Palestinian village where a young Palestinian man was shot dead, while an Israeli security guard was killed in an attack in Tel Aviv. In a statement, the army said the group was heading to carry out an attack and that an automatic rifle was found in their car. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the security forces, saying: \"We will continue to take action - everywhere and at any moment - against those who seek to attack us.\" The killings came the day after a Palestinian gunman fatally shot an Israeli security guard in Tel Aviv. Another guard shot and killed the attacker. After the killing of three Palestinians on Sunday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said: \"These horrific crimes in Jenin would not have taken place had the perpetrators not felt safe from punishment.\" Palestinian armed groups condemned the killings, vowing for revenge. \"The enemy, which assassinated three of our Palestinian people, will not escape paying the price of its crimes,\" said a spokesperson for Hamas who rules Gaza. The Islamic Jihad, which has members in Gaza and the West Bank, said: \"The enemy will realise that its foolishness and terrorism will be met by a strong response from the resistance.\" On Friday night, extremist settlers went on the rampage in a Palestinian village in the West Bank, killing a 19-year-old man. Israeli police say two settlers have been arrested. The latest settler attack has been condemned as terrorism by Washington, its stronger language appearing to show increased frustration with the positions of Israel's far-right government.",

        "title": "Niger coup: Junta shuts airspace citing military intervention threat",
        "content": "Niger's coup leaders have closed the country's airspace until further notice, citing the threat of military intervention from their neighbours. Flight tracking website Flightradar24 is showing that there are currently no aircraft in Niger's skies. The West African group of countries, Ecowas, had earlier warned it could use force if President Mohamed Bazoum was not reinstated by 23:00 GMT on Sunday. A junta spokesman says Niger's armed forces are ready to defend the country. Mr Bazoum was detained on 26 July, and Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, commander of the presidential guard, later proclaimed himself the new leader. The military takeover has been internationally condemned, including by former colonial power France and the rest of the European Union, as well as the United Nations and the United States. Reading a statement on national television on Sunday, the representative from Niger's junta said they had information that \"a foreign power\" was preparing to attack Niger. After a crisis meeting in Nigeria, Ecowas military chiefs said on Friday they had drawn up a detailed plan for the possible use of force. \"All the elements that will go into any eventual intervention have been worked out here, including the resources needed, the how and when we are going deploy the force,\" said Abdel-Fatau Musah, Ecowas commissioner for political affairs, peace and security. And he added: \"We want diplomacy to work, and we want this message clearly transmitted to them [Niger's junta] that we are giving them every opportunity to reverse what they have done\". They issued their ultimatum a week ago, demanding the generals relinquish power by midnight local time, which has now passed. Ecowas is a regional trading bloc of 15 West African countries, including Nigeria, Senegal, Togo and Ghana. The coup leaders seem to be showing no sign of willingness to cede power, and on Sunday thousands of their supporters rallied defiantly at a stadium in Niger's capital Niamey. Two of Niger's neighbours - Burkina Faso and Mali - earlier warned they would treat any outside military intervention in Niger as \"a declaration of war\" against them. Burkina Faso and Mali are both Ecowas members but have been suspended from the bloc since being ruled by military juntas. Niger is a significant uranium producer - a fuel that is vital for nuclear power - and under Mr Bazoum was a key Western ally in the fight against Islamist militants in West Africa's Sahel region. Where is Niger? It's a vast country in West Africa, and one of the poorest countries in the world. Why was there a coup? The military said it seized power because of insecurity and the economic situation, but there have been suggestions it came after reports the coup leader was about to be sacked. What next? It's feared the military may seek to switch allegiance to Russia and close French and US bases there; for their part, Niger's neighbours have threatened to use force to end the coup.",

        "title": "Zuckerberg 'not holding breath' over Musk cage fight",
        "content": "Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg has said he is \"not holding his breath\" over a proposed cage fight with rival Elon Musk. In a post on the new social media app Threads, Zuckerberg said he had proposed 26 August for the showdown. Responding to a post on X in which Musk claimed he was training \"throughout the day\", Zuckerberg wrote: \"I'm ready today... but he hasn't confirmed.\" The two became direct competitors in July with the launch of Threads. Asked by a Threads user whether the fight had been mutually agreed upon, Zuckerberg responded that is was more like \"funding secured,\" in an apparent reference to posts made by Musk in 2018 when he said the same about plans to take electric car company Tesla into private hands. That deal never happened and led to Musk paying a $20m fine to the US financial markets watchdog, stepping back from being Tesla's chairman and limits put on what he can tweet about Tesla. The social media moguls have been egging each other on in recent months, with Elon Musk claiming on Sunday that their fight would be broadcast live on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Musk said that any proceeds from a match would go to veterans charities. When asked what the point of the bout was by one X user, Musk responded: \"It's a civilized form of war. Men love war.\" Zuckerberg also shot back at the suggestion that the fight would be streamed on X, posting: \"Shouldn't we use a more reliable platform that can actually raise money for charity?\" The stakes are seemingly high after Meta, which also owns Instagram and Facebook, launched Threads in early July, drawing in more than 100 million sign-ups within days. Rival social media platform X has faced criticism on several occasions since Musk took over the firm (then called Twitter) and made a number of changes, such as forcing users to log in to view posts. He also carried out mass firings at the company. Musk posted a message on the social media platform in June claiming he was \"up for a cage fight\" - a fight which typically involves few rules. Zuckerberg then posted a screenshot Mr Musk's tweet with the caption \"send me location\", while Musk responded with: \"Vegas Octagon.\" The Octagon is the competition mat and fenced-in area used for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts. The UFC is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Musk, 52, also wrote: \"I have this great move that I call 'The Walrus', where I just lie on top of my opponent & do nothing.\" He later tweeted videos of walruses, perhaps suggesting his challenge to the Facebook founder may not have been entirely be serious. Zuckerberg is a martial arts enthusiast and said on Sunday: \"I love this sport and will continue competing with people who train no matter what happens here.\"",

        "title": "UCC: Common law proposal sparks fear in India tribes",
        "content": "For many years now, Anil Jonko's life follows a simple routine. He starts his day by offering prayers at his parents' grave in Chaibasa, a small village in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand dominated by the Ho tribal community. The 40-year-old then heads to a special court - set up two years ago to deal with civil matters of local tribespeople - where he is fighting a land dispute case. In India, special courts for tribal communities have been established to protect their culture and distinct identity. While there is no official figure on their number, a similar system is found in the north-eastern states where tribal courts decide on matters of marriage, divorce, adoption and inheritance based on their own personal laws and customs. At the court which Mr Jonko visits, there is no lawyer or judge. Three village leaders - one named by the complainant, one by the respondent and the third named by the local administration - hand out \"verdicts\". Mr Jonko says he prefers going there because the staff comprises people from his community and all the cases are heard in the local Ho language. Ho is one of the many indigenous languages spoken in Jharkhand where 27% of the population is made of tribespeople. But Mr Jonko now worries that his village's unique justice system would cease to exist. The fears were sparked earlier this year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) proposed a plan to enact a Uniform Civil Code or UCC - a single personal law for all citizens irrespective of religion, sex, gender and sexual orientation. At the moment, there is no clarity on the contents of UCC as there is no draft of the law yet. But the government argues that a common code is necessary to achieve gender justice; equality through uniform application of personal laws in matters of marriage, divorce and inheritance; and to foster national unity. The BJP, in one of its election manifestoes, said there \"cannot be gender equality till such time India adopts a Uniform Civil Code\". Critics, however, say that any attempt to push for it would divide communities and lead to a loss of their distinct identity and culture. The proposal is largely seen as a counter to personal laws of Muslims - which the government says are \"regressive\" - as it seeks to consolidate Hindu votes for the BJP ahead of the 2024 general election. But it has triggered a wave of anxiety among tribespeople who fear that the proposal interferes with their centuries-old practices and customs. \"Right now, a non-tribal person cannot buy land in our village. With the UCC anyone would be able to do that,\" Mr Jonko says. \"Our culture and tribal practices will be be wiped away.\" In Jharkhand, special laws have been in force for decades to protect the distinct identity of the state's 8.6 million tribespeople. This includes a 1908 law that prohibits the transfer of tribal land to non-tribal communities to ensure community ownership, and a 1876 law which prohibits non-Santhal people from buying Santhal land without the permission of the district magistrate. The Santhals are a tribe that occupy the area of Jharkhand bordering West Bengal state. Similar laws also exist in the north-eastern states, where autonomous district councils are set up to protect the land and culture of tribal communities. Santosh Kido, professor at Xavier's College in Ranchi city, says that tribespeople fear that a UCC would wipe away their identity. \"These people identify as tribal because of their distinct culture, tradition and customary laws. If the government puts all of these in one basket there will be nothing left for them,\" he says. Dayamani Barla, an activist who has been fighting for the rights of tribespeople in Jharkhand, agrees with the assessment. She says the tribal system of governance and self-rule is deeply connected with their customs and any attempt to do away with that would undermine their autonomy. \"Besides, how can you have one law for a diverse country like India?\" she asks. However, supporters of a UCC argue that it is a much needed reform to end discriminatory practices prevalent in local traditions and customs. In most tribal societies of Jharkhand for instance, daughters have no share in her father or husband's property. \"A common set of personal laws would bring gender equality among tribespeople,\" says Amar Kumar Chowdhary, professor at Ranchi Technical University. Mr Chowdhary adds that a UCC would also help to integrate these communities better with \"the national mainstream\". \"If it is implemented properly, it will be good for everyone. We will all move forward together,\" he said. There is no clarity on how much of this would actually happen under the new law or when will it be implemented. But tribespeople in Jharkhand say they are bracing for an uncertain future. \"We don't know much, we only hear about things on the TV,\" Mr Jonko says. \"But we are poor and helpless and we know we won't be able to stop it if the UCC is implemented.\" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

        "title": "The Irish Light: Woman abused by paper which falsely said vaccine killed her son",
        "content": "A grieving mother and her lawyer have been targeted by an extreme campaign of abuse after suing a conspiracy theory newspaper which falsely claimed her son died from a Covid vaccine. The Irish Light repeatedly abused Edel Campbell online and its supporters have threatened her lawyer with \"execution\". Conspiracy theorists worldwide have used dozens of tragic deaths to spread vaccine misinformation. This case is thought to be the first where a relative has sued. The Irish Light included Ms Campbell's son, Diego Gilsenan, and 41 others in an article last year which suggested the \"untested and dangerous\" Covid vaccine was to blame for the deaths. In fact, the BBC has been told Diego had taken his own life in August 2021, aged 18, and had not been vaccinated. The campaign of abuse following her legal case has been \"nothing short of shocking\" and may explain why other relatives have not taken action, Ms Campbell's solicitor, Ciaran Mulholland, told BBC Radio 4's Marianna in Conspiracyland podcast. \"You can understand why a lot of people were incredibly reluctant to go to a solicitor when they saw the backlash with Edel Campbell,\" he said. Ms Campbell told the BBC that the Irish Light has \"made my life hell\" and said she's now fearful of speaking out. The BBC has agreed not to use a photo of Ms Campbell - or her son - for this story to protect her. In frequent social media posts over several weeks, the Irish Light and its editor, Gemma O'Doherty, have accused Ms Campbell of \"outrageous lies\", being \"mentally unstable\" and involved in a \"massive fraud\". There are also extreme references to suicide about Ms Campbell. According to Mr Mulholland, people who support the Irish Light have called for him to be executed or shot, as well as anonymously calling his office and threatening other members of staff. Ms Campbell and her solicitor decided to bring a civil case against Ms O'Doherty for harassment with defamation, after the paper published a photo of her son Diego Gilsenan and others on the front page under the headline \"Died Suddenly\". This tagline has been widely used across social media by conspiracy theory activists to suggest unexpected deaths of young people are related to the Covid-19 vaccine. In the article that featured Ms Campbell's son, the Irish Light claims that the establishment is not questioning the \"mysterious deaths\" because \"they know exactly what it is: the untested and dangerous injection they forced into the Irish people\". Deaths from Covid vaccines are extremely rare. UK figures record 55 deaths where the vaccine was given as the underlying cause, out of more than 50m people who have had at least one dose. Among some of the other young people featured by the Irish Light, one died in a swimming pool accident, another from a head injury and a third from meningitis, according to their families. Ms Campbell says the Irish Light did not contact her for comment about Diego before publication. The BBC also understands that the Irish Light did not contact several other family members of young people featured. Mr Mulholland said the aim of the legal case is not \"retribution\" or compensation. \"All Edel Campbell wanted was to protect the integrity of Diego, and her family as a whole,\" he said. Ms Campbell's legal case has been funded through donations and her lawyer's pro-bono work. He told the BBC the legal proceedings were launched after various attempts to ask Gemma O'Doherty to remove the images of Diego Gilsenan failed and resulted in an escalation in online abuse. In July, the High Court in Dublin granted a restraining order that prohibits the Irish Light editor from contacting Ms Campbell and from using or publishing the image of her son for any purpose without his mother's consent. Abusive posts about Ms Campbell have continued on social media, including from the Irish Light account on X, formerly known as Twitter, which Gemma O'Doherty has admitted to running. Ms Campbell made reports of harassment to the police - but Mr Mulholland says they are yet to contact or question Gemma O'Doherty about these. Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na - the Republic of Ireland's national police service - told the BBC that it \"does not comment on named individuals\" or \"specifics of on-going investigations\". It says it continues to \"actively investigate the alleged harassment of an individual in the North Western Region\" of Ireland. Ms O'Doherty and the Irish Light have not responded to the BBC's request for comment. However, on social media the Irish Light says the BBC will \"do a character assassination\" on Gemma O'Doherty because \"she exposed the vaccine genocide\". In online posts, Ms O'Doherty denies harassing Edel Cambell and continues to suggest her son's death was sinister or mysterious in some way. She has instructed a solicitor to defend the case brought against her. The Irish Light is a sister paper of its namesake in the UK, the Light, although they are editorially independent of each other. The BBC previously revealed the UK paper has called for the execution of politicians and doctors. It has links to the British far-right and a German publication connected to a failed coup attempt. As well as more innocuous features, the Irish Light has published stories promoting conspiracy theories such as \"Pfizer knew the vaccine would kill\", \"Water fluoridation is lowering Irish IQ\", \"Why manmade climate change is a fraud\" and \"Irish to become a minority in Ireland\". While Ms Campbell is thought to be the first to sue over a false claim about a vaccine death, the case has parallels with other victims of conspiracy theorists. Manchester Arena bomb survivors are suing over claims the attack was faked and parents of Sandy Hook mass shooting victims won a landmark ruling against Infowars host Alex Jones.

        "title": "Seren Price, 5, to climb highest peak in North Africa",
        "content": "A five-year-old girl is aiming to reach new heights by climbing the highest point in North Africa. Seren Price became the youngest person to complete the UK's Three Peaks challenge in under 48 hours last year. If walking up the three highest points of Scotland, England and Wales was not enough, Seren and her dad Glyn, 44, now plan on climbing Mount Toubkal in Morocco. She is currently a finalist in a fundraiser award. The little explorer cut her teeth on the Welsh Three Peaks aged just three. The Welsh Three Peaks covers 17 miles (27km), taking on Yr Wyddfa and Cadair Idris, both in Eryri, and Pen y Fan in Bannau Brycheiniog. Then last December and aged just five, she and her father Glyn Price, a mountain leader, walked up Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Yr Wyddfa. Seren said her favourite parts of that 23-mile (37km) challenge was \"the view\" and \"being with my dad\". They next plan to take on Mount Toubkal, in Morocco's Atlas Mountains, the highest point in North Africa. When planning their challenge to climb the three highest peaks of Scotland, England and Wales, the Price family decided to use it as an opportunity to fundraise for a special cause. They wanted to give something back as Seren needed treatment at the Birmingham Children's Hospital as a premature newborn. \"They did remarkable wonders with her,\" said former firefighter Glyn, from Llangennech, Carmarthenshire. \"They're a brilliant hospital.\" Setting out to raise \u00a3100, the youngster instead received in excess of \u00a37,000 as the pair persevered in severe winter weather conditions and temperatures as low as -18C in December. Seren has been shortlisted in the JustGiving awards at London's Roundhouse on 25 September. She has already picked out a \"princess gown\" to wear to the ceremony and is looking forward the most to \"the ball and the dancing\" afterwards. Seren, who wants to be a doctor and rockstar when she grows up, helped a fellow climber in need on Ben Nevis during her Three Peaks challenge. After spotting the female walker suffering from exhaustion, she alerted her father, saying \"Daddy, we need to help\". She and her father called in mountain rescuers and assisted as the hiker was taken to a location where it was safe for a helicopter to land. \"We gave her our last Lucozade and she followed our torch down,\" Seren recalled. Glyn is no stranger to adventure having taken many groups on the National Three Peaks challenge. \"We thought it would be a good experience for Seren and a good chance for her to raise money for her chosen charity,\" he said. Max Woosey, known as the Boy in the Tent, was crowned as last year's Young Fundraiser of the Year after camping outside every night for three years in memory of his neighbour to raise \u00a3750,000 for North Devon Hospice.",

        "title": "Four soldiers killed in Israeli strike in Damascus, says Syria",
        "content": "Four Syrian soldiers have been killed and another four wounded in an overnight Israeli missile attack, Syria's state media say. Sana news agency is quoting a military source as saying the strike near the capital Damascus also caused some material damage. Some of the Israeli missiles were shot down, the source claims. Israel has so far made no comments. It frequently targets military sites in Syria linked to Iran-backed militants. AFP news agency says its correspondent in Damascus reported hearing the sound of explosions. Footage has also emerged on social media purportedly showing bright flashes in the sky in the vicinity of Damascus. In February, Syria accused Israel of killing four civilians and a soldier in missile strikes on Damascus. Israel's military rarely acknowledges specific strikes on targets in Syria, where Iran's influence has grown in recent years. Israel and Iran are bitter foes and in recent years have been engaged in what has been described as a \"shadow war\" of unclaimed attacks on each other's assets, infrastructure and nationals.",

        "title": "Belarus isolates political prisoners to break their spirit",
        "content": "For almost six months, Maria Kolesnikova has been hidden from the world. The Belarusian opposition activist has been held in total isolation in prison in the country since February, with no phone calls or letters and no visits from relatives or her lawyer. \"I wait for news every day\u2026 we don't even know if she's alive, really,\" Maria's sister, Tatsiana Khomich, told the BBC recently in Warsaw. \"I just hope this will not break her, but of course it influences anyone's mind in the end,\" she said, adding: \"It could be considered as torture.\" As the authorities in Belarus continue to track down and detain those involved in huge opposition rallies three years ago, they are also now holding the country's best-known political prisoners \"incommunicado\". Sergei Tikhanovsky and Viktor Babaryko have vanished into the prison system, too, as well as other key figures from the opposition. In 2020, both men attempted to run against the authoritarian Alexander Lukashenko for president, but were arrested. \"I think they want to break them, mentally,\" is how Tatsiana explained the isolation now of prominent detainees like her sister. \"They see they are still optimistic and very strong, and they want to break this mindset.\" Maria Kolesnikova was one of a trio of women who rallied crowds in nationwide protests after Mr Lukashenko claimed yet another landslide election win. The reaction was like nothing Belarus had ever seen. The protests against a rigged vote ended in mass arrests, beatings and torture - all thoroughly documented, but still flatly denied by officials. Maria stood out, not only for her bleached-blonde crewcut and bright red lips, but for the constant smile they formed and her defiantly positive attitude. It was that spirit that made her rip up her passport when the authorities tried to deport her - and that got her arrested. The last Tatsiana heard from her sister was a postcard from prison dated 2 February 2023. Maria wrote of longing for the old, free days when she would drink an abundance of coffee and discuss new projects with friends. But she drew a smiley face and a heart, assuring Tatsiana she was \"fine\", her mood \"more upbeat and impassioned\". Since then, there's been no word. Alexander Lukashenko has repeatedly claimed there's \"not one\" political prisoner in Belarus, because there's no such article in the criminal code. But the respected human rights group Viasna currently lists almost 1,500 people imprisoned for their peaceful political actions or views. One of its own activists, just released, was made to spend his last nine days in solitary confinement, sleeping on a damp concrete floor and using his fist for a pillow. \"Three political prisoners have died in prison, so it can be crucial for at least someone to see them,\" Natalia Satsunkevich told me from Lithuania, where the Viasna activist now lives for safety. She recalled the artist Ales Pushkin who died recently in custody with the official cause still unknown. \"He'd lost a lot of weight. So it would have been obvious,\" Natalia suggested. And the arrests haven't stopped. At a women's shelter in Warsaw, Inga described how police came for her two years after the protests were crushed. They had found photos of her on a friend's phone, including one from a rally where she was wearing the red and white opposition flag like a cape. \"They said, if you're 'political', then you'll feel it,\" Inga said, as she recalled her week at Okrestina detention centre in the Belarusian capital Minsk. There were 14 women in a cell with four beds; no showers, toothbrushes or toilet paper. \"They treated us like animals,\" she added. But that isn't the memory that makes her cry. It's when she remembers moving to pre-trial detention and realising that everyone in her cell was there for their politics. \"We had state TV and it talked as if nothing bad was happening,\" Inga said. \"And we were like, how can you say it's all OK, when so many people are in prison? \"I didn't know people were being imprisoned in such numbers. Then you get there and everyone's political. It's a nightmare,\" she confided, crying quietly. \"We're sent to prison, just for our words.\" Sentenced to house arrest, Inga fled the country earlier this year with the help of activists. She didn't tell her son where they were going until they were safely in Europe. She couldn't risk him revealing the secret. She now joins a rally in central Warsaw every Sunday to sing Belarusian songs, remember other political prisoners and chant against the war their country is helping to wage on Ukraine. Only a handful turn out, although the number of Belarusian exiles in Poland is growing all the time. \"I think that's a betrayal,\" organiser Anna Fedoronok told me. \"If we forget all the people in prison, then we're betraying them.\" \"We're free here. If we don't speak out, who will?\" She and a friend now film skits for social media: they dress up as elderly women, in headscarves and housecoats, contorting their faces and cackling into the camera. They prop a framed photograph of Mr Lukashenko on the sofa behind them, like an icon. The women are fighting a repressive regime by laughing at it. \"I have no other weapon,\" Anna said. \"Should I just sit here and wait for change? I can't.\" When prominent opposition figures like Maria Kolesnikova were handed long sentences, their supporters tried to remain positive: Alexander Lukashenko couldn't last in power that long, they reasoned. So the prisoners would soon be freed. Instead they're being punished further, with isolation. \"They want to make people forget them, so we don't speak about them,\" Tatsiana Khomich believes. \"They want to get back to life as usual, as if they never tortured people or sentenced them to 10 or 20 years,\" she added. \"But they can't succeed in that.\"",

        "title": "The Asian Pacific Diaspora Is in the Midst of a Golden Wave",
        "content": "Growing up a Third Culture kid between Dolly Parton\u2019s Knoxville, Tenn., late-90s Shanghai, and 2000s Southern California engineers a unique loneliness. After all, when you belong to so many places, do you belong anywhere? But as my single mother once said: When you can\u2019t come home, you build your own. Like all minorities, the Asian Pacific diaspora is perennially hyphenated. We\u2019re tugged between the nations of our ancestors and our present; we contend with simultaneous incongruities that prevent us from self-realization and collective coordination. Executives who break the \u201cbamboo ceiling\u201d\u2014Asians are the least likely demographic to be promoted to management, according to Harvard Business Review\u2014face imposter syndrome. And if they\u2019re able to regain their confidence, many worry that they\u2019re perpetuating the Model Minority Myth that overshadows income disparities within our community\u2014and furthers our own divides with other marginalized groups. Our multilingual upbringings foreignize us; adopting certain Western behaviors can deny critical elements of our own heritage, something some demonize as a Sunken Place. Within our own community, our dozens of ethnicities, hundreds of dialects, and lack of a universal story or struggle further our fracture. Yet, despite our ostensive misalignment and our continued need to combat hate aimed at Asian Pacific communities, our diaspora has seen a golden wave of cultural and economic progress\u2014that has broken records and defined industries in short order. May 1st marks the beginning of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month. Each year, to spotlight the Asian Pacific diaspora\u2019s most impactful societal contributions, Gold House releases the A100\u2014our own TIME100. This year, journalist Alex Wagner, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, actor Ke Huy Quan, fashion designer Anna Sui, and baseball player Shohei Ohtani all made the list, which covers industries ranging from politics to business to entertainment to fashion to sports. This is our 6th year publishing this list. And with so many Asian Pacific leaders in prominent positions around the world, it\u2019s never been harder to winnow the 100. Put simply: we\u2019re in the midst of a golden hour. But how? Why did this happen, seemingly, within only the last few years? Population growth contributes. Our diaspora in the United States nearly doubled between 2000 and 2019\u2014and buying power has, similarly, skyrocketed by 127% from 2000 to 2020. But a powerful population doesn\u2019t ensure concentrated change. Research by Gold House in 2018 with 500 of the top Asian Pacific leaders across business, culture, and activism indicated a universal prioritization of four core challenges\u2014with the first being enhancing how the media portrayed us (or didn\u2019t at all). As they say, seeing is believing. Media representation became the unifying battleground through Crazy Rich Asians, the first Asian-led major studio project in 25 years. In 2018, many studio executives did not believe that Asians were a viable market\u2014partly due to our 7% domestic population at the time. But by adapting successful galvanization models by Black churches in the late 80s and from women in the 2000s, several industry leaders jumpstarted Jon M. Chu\u2019s critically-lauded romantic comedy with a promotional engine now known as #GoldOpen, using theater buyouts and other viral tactics to guarantee that Crazy Rich Asians was a hit at the box office. Since then, #GoldOpen has ensured the opening weekend success of more than two dozen Asian-led films including, most recently, Everything Everywhere All At Once. Prioritizing market viability isn\u2019t new. Creators can come from anywhere but haven\u2019t always been able to go everywhere. Marketing has always been half the battle\u2014most easily evidenced by its percentage of total theatrical release budgets. YouTube was and continues to be the bastion for minority creators to reach the mainstream. In 2010, for instance, 25% of YouTube\u2019s top categories were Asian-led; accessible bandwidth and ubiquitous smart device distribution gave permission to niche creation. Beyond YouTube, a recent study conducted by Nielsen and Gold House indicated that streaming platforms like Netflix have twice the AANHPIs of broadcast programs. And, of course, there\u2019s K-pop, whose listening share grew 65% annually since 2015 on Spotify and Apple Music and even more during the pandemic. Alongside demonstrative distribution, the Asian Pacific diaspora won the ability to influence storytelling upstream. Through increased budgets for inclusive content development and production as well as cultural consultation practices that dismantle pernicious stereotypes, more authentic projects have flourished. This inclusive influence has accelerated due to executive greenlighting power. From Netflix (the platform\u2019s Chief Content and Marketing Officers are Asian women\u2014Bela Bajaria and Marian Lee Dicus) to a legion of studio chiefs including Albert Cheng of Amazon Prime Video, Asad Ayaz and Nancy Lee of Disney, Ramsey Naito of Paramount and Nickelodeon Animation, and Agnes Chu of Cond\u00e9 Nast Entertainment, diverse leaders have demonstrated the power and imperative of inclusive crews, casts, and colleagues for all marginalized communities. Super producers like AUM Group and Significant Productions\u2019 Nina Yang Bongiovi utilize their own outfits for enabling multicultural filmmakers who don\u2019t just create great art\u2014but great art that challenges societal canon. At conglomerates like CJ, leaders like Vice Chair Miky Lee and ENM Chief Global Officer Steve Chung and Kakao\u2019s recent majority stake in SM (creating the largest non-Western-based music label) continue to leverage inclusion and cultural specificity to commercial and critical acclaim around the world. When you don\u2019t have a seat at the table, you don\u2019t just shatter that room\u2019s ceiling; you build your own house and bring everyone in. Finally, the diversification of voting bodies to include younger, even more diverse voters\u2014like The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences currently helmed by President Janet Yang\u2014has enabled films like Everything Everywhere All At Once to become the most-awarded film in history. While shiny awards may be met with ambivalence, the uptick in consumption of Academy Award-recognized films indicates that distillation for the masses is essential to break through a noisy world. As voted on by the top Asian Pacific nonprofits and our community\u2019s foremost leaders, the A100 is the definitive recognition for our community\u2019s cultural contributions. Each year, we\u2019re often asked: are there even 100 top AANHPIs to recognize? There have always been worthy AANHPIs. Now the world is actually seeing them.",

        "title": "States With the Highest Rates of Mass Shootings",
        "content": "This June, one weekend saw 11 people killed and 60 injured in mass shootings. The end of that month marked the U.S.'s deadliest six months of mass shootings in decades, and on July 22, an attack in a Houston park brought the number of mass shootings in 2023 to 400. More and more, it seems there\u2019s no place to avoid the threats they pose.  But some states are certainly more dangerous than others, at least according to a new dataset released by a team at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, which for the first time maps the geographic distribution of mass shooting incidence rates. In their study, published July 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open, the authors provide clear metrics on mass shootings in each state and the District of Columbia from 2014 through 2022. Among statistics like the numbers of shootings related to domestic violence, crime, and what the authors call \"social motivations\"\u2014like racism, religious hate, and domestic terrorism\u2014the authors provided the rate of mass shootings per capita in each state. The result, which uses data from the Gun Violence Archive, is a simple geographic distribution showing where people are most affected by mass shootings, which the study defines as an incident where four or more people, not including the shooter, are shot or killed. (There\u2019s no universally agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a mass shooting, making results like these difficult to compare across studies).   The largest, more densely populated states like California and Texas have the most mass shootings in almost any given year. But when accounting for the number of people who live in each state, however, these behemoths have nowhere near the highest rates in the country. Texas, in fact, falls right in the middle as the state with the 25th highest rate, with 1.05 shootings per 1,000,000 people. California is in 27th place.  The states with the  highest rates of large-scale gun violence are mostly clustered in the south: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina, along with Missouri. With the exception of Missouri, all of these states were also among the five with the highest rates of social-related mass shootings, including the racist 2015 attack on a Charleston church. Louisiana also had the highest rate of crime-related mass shootings, and, along with Mississippi and Missouri, also came out near the top in domestic violence-related mass shootings.  Only two states, Hawaii and North Dakota, saw no mass shootings at all in the 9 years included in the study.  Though the authors of the study didn\u2019t provide theories on why rates were higher in certain states and regions than others, the seemingly large variety in key motivations across mass shootings in the high-rate Southern states suggest that it may be worth investigating other potential common factors at play.",

        "title": "Alex Morgan Is Entering Her Fourth World Cup in Top Form",
        "content": "Alittle more than a year ago, Alex Morgan felt out of the national-team loop. This was an unsettling position for the star American forward, who\u2019s scored 115 goals\u2014the fifth-most in U.S. history\u2014during her international career. She\u2019s a player who, along with Megan Rapinoe, has been the face of the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team (USWNT) for more than a decade. But Morgan didn\u2019t perform at her usual level at the pandemic-marred 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Spending 35 days away from her then one-year-old daughter, Charlie, taxed her mind. The Americans fell to Canada in the semis and won bronze. Morgan did not attend the last national-team training camp of that year. She wasn\u2019t on the roster for the first few camps of 2022. She\u2019d have to prove her worth all over again. But at 32, not 22. Sign up for \u2018Extra Time,\u2019 our new newsletter that will break down the biggest moments from the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup Then, during the 2022 National Women\u2019s Soccer League season, Morgan exploded. Playing for the expansion San Diego Wave FC, in a comfortable city where she and her husband, pro soccer player Servando Carrasco, plan on settling, Morgan, now 34, won the Golden Boot as the league\u2019s top goal scorer. She netted 15 goals in 17 games. It was her career best. So Morgan\u2019s entering this World Cup, her fourth, in top form. \u201cI know what to expect a little bit more now,\u201d she told TIME Studios for an upcoming Netflix documentary about the team. \u201cIn previous World Cup preps, I probably would be overstressed on things, like what I was eating, what I was doing every single day, how many hours of sleep I was getting. Every little detail. Of course these details matter. But I\u2019m not getting on myself about the little things. If I don\u2019t do something perfect, it\u2019s OK.\u201d \u201cOne thing that is different for Alex than the Olympics is that she had a lot more time to spend with the team,\u201d says USWNT coach Vlatko Andonovski. Morgan had taken some time off after giving birth to Charlie in May 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the typical training schedules. \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes for the players to get back into the rhythm, get back in the environment,\u201d says Andonovski. \u201cAnd I think in some ways, it wasn\u2019t fair for Alex before the Olympics. When she\u2019s on the field, she\u2019s comfortable in the environment. She\u2019s been in this environment longer than most players. So I think that we\u2019re going to see the best of Alex this summer.\u201d Morgan agrees with her coach. For one, she believes motherhood has helped her game. \u201c[Parenthood] just makes me feel more balanced all around,\u201d she told PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019m able to give everything to the sport and my teams, but when I go home, I\u2019m not dwelling on whether I had a bad training or bad game. I just have to be a mom and tend to my child\u2019s needs instead of overanalyzing things.\u201d Read More: A Viral French Ad Shows How Women\u2019s Soccer Can Be Just as Exciting as Men\u2019s Charlie also forced Morgan to adjust her tactics. \u201cComing back from giving birth was really hard,\u201d she told TIME Studios. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel super quick or super fast right away. I had already adapted my game to kind of finding the ball, and finding spaces in different ways without having to use my speed. So by the time my speed did come back from pregnancy, I was able to mesh the two together a little bit more. I feel like I\u2019m finding myself in good goal-scoring positions more frequently than I ever have before.\u201d As evidenced by her Golden Boot. While Morgan will be expected to shoulder a scoring load in New Zealand and Australia, she\u2019ll also have to guide younger players\u2014like fellow forwards Trinity Rodman, 21, Sophia Smith, 22 and Alyssa Thompson, 18\u2014through their first World Cup experience. \u201cEvery day in camp, Alex is always taking me under her wing,\u201d says Smith. \u201cHelping me, explaining things to me. She\u2019s someone that I\u2019ve looked up to my whole life. I can watch how she goes through life and learn from it, day in and day out.\u201d Rather than feel threatened by the rising stars, Morgan admires them. \u201cThey\u2019re owning where they are,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cThe confidence I\u2019ve seen from these young players is unmatched.\u201d Read More: 5 Controversies to Know About Ahead of the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup She\u2019s looking forward to her first World Cup as a mom. Charlie will make the trip. \u201cShe really wants to go swimming all day every day,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cI have to break it to her that it\u2019s winter\u201d in Australia and New Zealand. Crystal Dunn\u2019s son, Marcel, 1, will also fly to the World Cup, while Julie Ertz\u2019s son, Madden, who turns 1 in August, traveled with the team to New Zealand. While Morgan\u2019s still got plenty to accomplish on the pitch, she\u2019s also thinking about her legacy. Supporting moms in sports is top of mind. \u201cWe have three moms on the roster going to the World Cup,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cThat\u2019s a testament to the support that we\u2019ve gotten from this team, the federation, from the NWSL, from our sponsors. That\u2019s not the case around the world. And we\u2019re trying to make a stand for it and show that the amount of support that you get is necessary in order to compete at the highest level.\u201d",

        "title": "How Offshore Wind Can Supply 25% of U.S. Electricity by 2050",
        "content": "Currently, six turbines off the coast of Rhode Island account for the lion\u2019s share of the U.S.\u2019s offshore wind energy production, providing 30 megawatts of electricity, or enough power to supply about 5% of the homes in one of the country\u2019s smallest states. In less than three decades, though, researchers believe that massive offshore turbines could be producing more than 10,000 times as much energy, enough to supply up to a quarter of the country\u2019s future electricity demand.  Those were the findings of a detailed new report from the University of California Berkeley, which concluded offshore wind could feasibly supply between 10% and 25% of the country\u2019s energy demand by 2050, thanks to long coastlines with sustained winds in many areas, and falling turbine costs.  Currently, countries in Europe and Asia are far ahead in building turbines off their shores, with the U.S. only now getting started after decades of delay\u2014the country\u2019s first large-scale offshore wind farm started laying underwater foundations off the coast of Massachusetts in June. But the U.S. is almost certainly going to need more of its own offshore power. Simply put, to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050, the renewable energy buildout will have to be enormous. Not only does the U.S. have to decarbonize its current electrical system, replacing the natural gas and coal plants that still account for about 60% of electricity nationwide, but the country also needs to build out vastly more renewable energy to replace gas powered cars and oil-burning boilers with electric vehicles and heat pumps. Hypothetically, the U.S. could attempt to build out all that renewable energy on land, though the feat would be monumental. To supply all the energy the U.S. is likely to need in the coming decades, it\u2019ll have to start building land-based wind farms and solar panels at about five times the rate compared to 2021, according to the report. That year was already a record-breaker, with the U.S. building out an enormous 28 gigawatts of solar and wind power. That\u2019s roughly equivalent to the entire power plant capacity of Washington state. If the U.S. makes a big offshore wind push, however, things are likely to be somewhat easier: land-based renewables will only have to be built out at about three or four times the 2021 rate, according to the report.  But launching an explosion of offshore wind development is no simple task. There\u2019s the fact of determined political opposition, often funded by the oil industry. And it\u2019ll also require an array of federal, state, and local policies, as well as hundreds of billions of dollars in investment, according to the Berkeley researchers, who worked with climate think tanks GridLab and Energy Innovation on the report.  The Biden Administration has already set a goal to build 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030, but the U.S. government will have to scale that up to something resembling the goals in Europe if the sector is to have a shot of potentially supplying a quarter of the country's electricity. E.U. leaders are aiming to have 300 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2050.  The push will also require a lot more state and federal bureaucrats. Permitting agencies will need more staff to cut down wait times for companies trying to develop new offshore wind sites, while agencies responsible for planning electrical transmission systems will need bigger budgets to start devising regional electrical systems that will be able to efficiently distribute the new power, according to the report (such pre-planning could save billions of dollars in electricity costs down the road). The U.S. will also need to expand workforce training programs, build up massive new supply chains, including huge new domestic steel plants, and build up port infrastructure to handle the task of bringing enormous turbine components out to sea.  Creating an entirely new clean energy industry is sure to have some notable benefits as well, even beyond helping stave off the worst effects of climate change. Such a buildout could, for instance, help create almost 390,000 jobs, according to the report authors\u2019 estimates. \u201cThe technical ability to build out America\u2019s offshore wind sector and enjoy all the benefits of clean, reliable, affordable electricity is there,\u201d Mike O\u2019 Boyle, senior director of electricity policy at Energy Innovation said in a statement. \u201cWe just need political leadership to pass the right policies.\u201d",

        "title": "How 2024 Longshot Candidates Are Using Podcasts",
        "content": "If you follow politics on social media, video clips of long-shot 2024 presidential candidates have likely been all over your feeds recently, sitting in studios or offices with podcast microphones pressed to their faces. In recent months, Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Republican Vivek Ramaswamy have embarked on a podcast blitz, using their campaigns as calling cards for any show that will have them on\u2014from obscure history, wellness or crypto podcasts to Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter Spaces and Joe Rogan\u2019s popular program. It\u2019s an approach driven by necessity: television networks and media outlets tend to give long-shots little airtime or attention compared to the leading candidates. But as Kennedy and Ramaswamy have recognized, hundreds of podcasts and livestreams are happy to offer fringe contenders the opportunity to expound on their views for hours, usually without being challenged or fact-checked. Video clips of the exchanges are then widely disseminated across social platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Twitter, reaching bigger audiences than many traditional media outlets. Read More: Inside the Very Online Campaign of RFK Jr. It\u2019s a test run of a new kind of strategy for the social-media era: make yourself impossible to ignore by flooding the online ecosystem with appearances on alternate platforms. The resulting headlines often inflate the candidates\u2019 importance or support, and could ultimately become a headache for President Joe Biden or the Republican frontrunners. These kinds of candidates have \u201cfigured out a style of weaponized contrarianism that garners a lot of engagement,\u201d says Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab. \u201cIt\u2019s this \u2018vibes only\u2019 approach to mass media.\u201d For Kennedy, podcasts and alternative platforms offer a chance to speak to large audiences after more than 15 years of being relegated to the fringes for his anti-vaccine activism. Now, the views that once got him banned from social media for violating disinformation policies are being widely circulated on the same platforms through clips of his podcast appearances. \u201cOur strategy is not complex or targeted\u2026[but] we\u2019re getting a lot of traction,\u201d Kennedy told TIME in an interview in June, explaining that he views podcasts as a medium he can use to his advantage the same way his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, used television in the 1960s. \u201cIt\u2019s just about telling the truth to people and listening to what they say\u2026and big groups of people are listening. So that\u2019s nice.\u201d After appearing on Rogan\u2019s massively popular podcast on June 15, Kennedy\u2019s 2021 book The Real Anthony Fauci\u2014in which he accuses the top U.S. infectious-disease doctor of orchestrating \u201ca historic coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Western democracy\u201d\u2014shot up to become the #10 best-selling book on Amazon, his publisher says. It has sold more than 100,000 copies since he announced his presidential run. \u201cI\u2019m not attracted at all to soundbite politics,\u201d Kennedy explained in a June 8 interview with TIME. \u201cI\u2019m better at kind of explaining the complexities of issues, so I think [podcasts] are a much better medium for me. And the weird thing about it is that people are listening, particularly young people.\u201d For Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old biotech entrepreneur, the attention podcasts can bring has helped build name recognition and a larger online following. Previously little-known to most Republican voters, Ramaswamy announced in April that he was launching a daily podcast called \u201cThe Vivek Show,\u201d to \u201cpull back the curtain on the political process.\u201d It\u2019s reportedly part of a $10 million investment in media production that he plans to continue even if he drops his presidential bid, which is built on a promise to take the America First agenda \u201cfurther than Trump.\u201d Since that rollout, Ramaswamy has posted 55 episodes\u2013an average of one episode every day and a half. He\u2019s interviewed a host of conservative personalities, including former Attorney General Bill Barr and former NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch. In the meantime, he has gone on more than 70 podcasts himself, delivering polished, video-clip-friendly talking points to conservative commentators like Dan Bongino and Jordan Peterson as well as appearing on shows like \u201cRetirement Talk\u201d and \u201cAlmost 30,\u201d a women\u2019s wellness podcast. Read More: Why Vivek Ramaswamy is Defending Trump More Forcefully Than Other 2024 Contenders. The medium comes with a significant audience. Despite an increasingly saturated market, podcasts have continued to grow in popularity over the last decade. As of 2023, 42% of Americans over the age of 12 listen to at least one podcast per month, according to Edison Research, up from 12% in 2013. Political podcasts in particular have taken off, with everyone from Trump adviser Steve Bannon to former Obama strategist David Axelrod and Sen. Ted Cruz hosting regular conversations which are increasingly filmed and distributed as short clips. In right-wing media, these podcasts and online shows seem to have stepped into the role of conservative talk radio, creating popular commentators like Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino. The podcast strategy won\u2019t necessarily translate into votes. Ramaswamy is currently averaging 3% in polling nationally. While Kennedy started off polling around 20% with Democrats largely due to his name ID, analysts predict his track record of espousing conspiracies and increasingly close ties to right-wing personalities ultimately won\u2019t fly with party voters\u2014in one June poll, his net favorability among Democrats had fallen from 18% to 7%, while it jumped to 29% among Republicans. But to these candidates, the polls may not be the point. What matters is the exposure the medium provides\u2014and the fact they will continue to get more of it if they, and the people they\u2019re speaking to, are very loud and very online. \u201cThis is the first time there\u2019s someone actually speaking my language,\u201d says Justin Rezvani, a 34-year-old social media entrepreneur and Kennedy supporter who says he has never voted in a presidential election before but likes the candidate\u2019s views on cryptocurrency and censorship. \u201cIt\u2019s my personal belief that the 2024 election will not be determined by mainstream media approach\u2026but will be built upon this decentralized podcast and creator network that distributes the message.\u201d",

        "title": "The Food to Eat During a Heat Wave",
        "content": "As temperatures continue to climb in what could become the northern hemisphere\u2019s hottest summer on record, the summer of 2023 is all about finding any way to stay cool. And that includes turning to foods that will hopefully provide a little relief. While not a panacea for the heat, body-cooling foods and no-cook diets could help to lower body temperature and make record-breaking heat waves a little more bearable.. Living safely in consistently hot climates means staying hydrated, especially with chilled drinks or fruits. But there are other, more physiologically based\u2014and even surprising\u2014ways to make your diet more heat friendly. While the science behind diets, nutrition, and climate is still growing, changing global temperatures makes understanding the link between food and metabolism increasingly critical. One place to start is to explore how heat influences diets in warmer parts of the world. Why, for example, do the spiciest foods come from the hottest places on the planet? Think southeast Asian curries and peppers, and South American chilis. If spicy foods make you sweat and feel even hotter, why are they such a staple in warmer regions? There\u2019s a biological reason for that, says Dr. William Li, a former Harvard Medical School faculty member who has written a book about finding the right diet for your metabolism. What happens when you dig into a spicy dish? Your heart beats a little faster, you breathe a little harder, you start to perspire, and not just your mouth but your whole body can feel as if it\u2019s on fire. And if you\u2019re eating this dish and it\u2019s above 90F outside, you\u2019re really feeling the heat. But sweating is the body\u2019s physiological response to being too hot. \u201cOur sole means of cooling is to sweat,\u201d says Dr. Linda Shiue, an internist and chef who is director of culinary and lifestyle medicine at Kaiser Permanente San Francisco. Once you sweat, the perspiration evaporating moisture cools the skin. We\u2019re not talking tens of degrees here\u2014it\u2019s fractions of single digits of change in temperature, but it\u2019s still something. If the body\u2019s core temperature starts climbing\u2014which it does if you\u2019re exposed to extreme heat for too long\u2014sweating cools off the skin in an attempt to bring that core temperature down. Eating spicy foods jumpstarts that process, which is why they\u2019re so popular in hotter regions of the world. \u201cCultures in these parts of the world have known this for thousands of years,\u201d says Li. \u201cTheir culinary culture triggers a hard-wired system that opens your pores and releases heat from the body. You feel temporarily hotter but that\u2019s part of the package of cooling down.\u201d That hard-wired system involves a protein on our cells called TRPV1, which acts as a receptor for the active agents in spicy foods, such as capsaicin and capsinoids. The cells that have the highest concentration of TRPV1 receptors are on the tongue and the front of the roof of the mouth. Those spice agents trigger the receptors to send signals to the brain to release norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter primarily responsible for launching the fight-or-flight response. When this hyper-alert response is triggered, the body releases heat by triggering the sweats. That was helpful to human ancestors trying to outrun potential predators thousands of years ago\u2026and also turns out to be useful in adapting to climate change today. There are a bunch of foods and spices that can activate TRPV1. In addition to hot peppers, sweet peppers and black pepper can also stimulate the receptor. Garlic can as well, through a different chemical called diallyl sulfide, which doesn\u2019t produce the same spicy sensation in the mouth but has the same end effect of activating norepinephrine and generating perspiration. Ginger and galangal, another root vegetable with a sharp, citrusy taste, are other foods\u2014also commonly used in hotter regions\u2014that can cause the same sweating and cooling effect. Read more on extreme heat: How to sleep when it\u2019s really hot outside The difference between heat stress, exhaustion, and stroke The art of air conditioner maintenance Extreme heat hits companies where it hurts There are also other, less obvious foods that work on TRPV1, but the data supporting how they are connected isn\u2019t solid enough yet. There is anecdotal data suggesting, for example, that fruits such as durian and pineapple can help to cool, but in different ways. Durian may activate TRPV1 and generate perspiration, while an enzyme in pineapple called bromelain can slow digestion, which reduces the amount of energy, and therefore heat, generated by that process. In Mexico, says Shiue, people often season their helpings of fruit\u2014which are helpful for staying hydrated when the weather is warm\u2014with tajin, a blend of dried chilis, lime juice, and salt. Another popular seasoning in the region is chamoy, made from pickled fruit and chilis. \u201cHow brilliant is this as a way to keep yourself cool as well as hydrated?\u201d she says. In India, known for its long periods of hot days, the beverage of choice is nimbu pani, a mix of lemon or lime juice, salt, and sugar that not only cools but replaces electrolytes lost when the body is over heated. Early data from animals also suggests that cinnamon can lower the stomach\u2019s temperature by decreasing the amount of acid and enzymes secreted by cells, which can cool the body by as much as two degrees C. More conflicting data suggests that ingesting or smoking CBD could produce the same \u2018flushed\u2019 feeling and generate perspiration similar to the way spicy foods can, but more research is needed to verify this body-cooling effect.. Metabolically, there\u2019s another way that the TRPV1 system helps to keep the body cool that\u2019s also counterintuitive at first. TRPV1 can burn brown fat, which is more abundant in newborns but is still present in adults, primarily in the neck, upper chest, and under the arms. In colder climates, people burn more of this brown fat because it\u2019s a super-efficient way to generate body heat. That\u2019s because in order to generate more heat, brown fat works together with white fat\u2014the more common form of fat that people gain with age as their metabolism slows down\u2014and starts using it as fuel. So when the body\u2019s core temperature really starts to rise, brown fat can kick in to counterintuitively make people sweat even more, in an effort to cool down. Looking more broadly, Li says there are other ways that people might adapt their eating as the world warms. Cutting back on daily calories can lower core body temperature, since when your body processes calories, it generates energy and heat. A 2011 study showed that reducing daily calorie intake by 23% can lower body temperature by under half a degree celsius. That may not sound like a huge drop, but when combined with other strategies, could help prevent heat stroke and related issues. Intermittent fasting can also lower body temperature by triggering the body to burn calories differently. When we eat, we produce insulin to help break down those calories or store them as fat. During fasting, the body starts delving into those fat deposits for energy\u2014in a way that generates less heat than the insulin-creating process. The body may be taking advantage of this strategy during extremely hot periods; when it\u2019s uncomfortably hot, most people\u2019s appetites start to wane, and this may be a physiologic coping mechanism for surviving the heat. \u201cThe body does anything it can to minimize the intake of energy and the generation of more heat, and that includes eating,\u201d says Shiue. That\u2019s not to say that fasting is a solution to keeping cool, since whatever small temperature benefits that come with it must be balanced with the potential dangers of becoming malnourished. The science of how the human body\u2019s energy needs change with heat, and therefore how heat affects things like how much and what people eat, is still in its early stages. But the latest studies on receptors like TRPV1 could help the world adapt to climate change as temperatures keep rising. \u201cAs we better understand how foods in certain cultures have been beneficial in cooling, I think it would be natural to adapt some of those ingredients in the culinary style of eating of the western world,\u201d says Li. Shiue agrees. \u201cIf people know that yes, certain ways of eating have a function such as cooling the body, then maybe they will start to creep into our daily food choices,\u201d she says. Which would make diets one more aspect of human existence that could be forever transformed by climate change.",

        "title": "Racism Is Not a Mental Illness\u2014But It\u2019s Complicated",
        "content": "Everyone knows that Law & Order plotlines are often, as they say, ripped from the headlines. But Dr. Alvin Poussaint, 88, knows this on another level: An emeritus professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, he has had the unusual experience of seeing his ideas incorporated into a season 12 episode of the long-running show. In it, a white working stiff murders a Black CEO in a dispute over a New York City taxicab. When the trial begins, a respected Black psychiatrist takes the stand to present his idea that the defendant suffers from \u201cextreme racism,\u201d a mental illness. His lawyers argue that extreme racism has such a complete hold on the defendant that it mitigates their client\u2019s legal responsibility for the murder. In the final moments, the audience is encouraged to feel that it\u2019s a victory for justice, for law and order, when the jury rejects the psychiatrist\u2019s ideas, Poussaint tells me with a tinge of disdain. In the real world, Poussaint was that psychiatrist. Sort of. While he never brought his ideas to the witness stand inside the New York City courthouse behind those massive stone steps that Law & Order made famous, in 1999 he shared his theories on the link between mental health and extreme forms of bigotry on the op-ed pages of the New York Times. In doing so, he helped set off a debate that ended with the American psychiatric establishment publicly rejecting the concept\u2014partly on the grounds that so many people are racists. But even now, after nearly a decade during which the number of hate crimes has steadily increased, the question of the relationship between bigotry and mental illness has never fully been resolved. In fact, recent high-profile incidents have made public perception of that dynamic perhaps as muddled as ever. The issue comes up in relation to everything from major mass shootings to pop-culture discourse. The racist attack at a Buffalo, N.Y., supermarket, for which the gunman pleaded guilty this week to state murder and domestic terrorism charges, prompted calls for the country to \u201cget serious about mental health\u201d as well as pleas not to talk about the shooting as a matter of psychiatric illness rather than a racist hate crime. Read more: Anti-Black Violence Has Long Been the Most Common American Hate Crime\u2014And We Still Don\u2019t Know the Full Extent It\u2019s hard to distinguish what psychiatric experts have decided not to define, to separate what Poussaint calls \u201ceveryday racism\u201d\u2014covering the span from systemic discrimination to microaggressions\u2014from the extreme version, which he and others have described as the point at which bigotry so deeply shapes behavior that a person struggles to function and sometimes becomes dangerous. But the question is more than just a thought experiment. If extreme racism were to become accepted as a mental illness per se, more suspects in hate-crime cases could potentially have recourse to mount \u201cinsanity\u201d defenses in court. And given all the mass shootings and disturbing public events in which extreme racism appears to have played some part since Poussaint first described his ideas, it\u2019s also hard not to wonder. Might developing a research-backed extreme-racism diagnosis\u2014and sound treatments\u2014have saved lives? Though the FBI typically releases data each fall detailing the prior year\u2019s hate-crimes statistics, the agency has not yet done so in 2022. But social conditions are rife, experts say, for the increase to continue. (In 2020, the most recent year for which FBI data is available, the agency reported 8,263 incidents\u2014an increase of nearly a thousand over the prior year, despite 452 fewer agencies reporting\u2014and most experts believe the real number is higher.) Police have noted that 47 out of 100 people arrested for hate crimes in New York City in early 2022 \u201chave prior documentation of an [emotionally disturbed person] incident.\u201d So the stakes are high for the nation\u2019s courtrooms to respond to the trauma unleashed by that dynamic\u2014and for Americans to decide what constitutes a just outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d says Sander Gilman, a historian at Emory University who researches the relationship between health, science, law, and society, and who has long taught a course on extremism. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to start with two things that I call Gilman\u2019s Law: not all racists are crazy, but crazy people can be racists.\u201d Thanks in part to the influence of pop culture\u2014not least those TV police procedurals\u2014many assume that insanity pleas are common. In reality, mental-health defenses are rare, and even more rarely lead to reduced punishment. Mounting that kind of defense requires time and significant resources to gather evidence and expert testimony, so in practice it is not an avenue available to all defendants. In England and the U.S., courts began to reliably consider the mental health of defendants only in the 19th century. The M\u2019Naghten rule, a standard for determining a defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of a crime, was established in 1840s England. It holds that only the sane can be held responsible for their actions. As a result, the question of mental fitness\u2014sufficient sanity to participate meaningfully in one\u2019s own defense\u2014is sometimes evaluated before a trial. (Whether the state has an obligation or right to treat such an illness in order for the person to then stand trial is, Gilman says, a question that goes back as far as the idea of such a defense.) Once a competency decision has been made, the accused who do go to trial have the right to a defense. In some cases, that may include an option for a jury to find the defendant not guilty by reason of mental disorder. In others, ideas about the mental health of the defendant may more informally shape what evidence is presented. But so-called \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d defenses are used in only about 1% of cases, says Michael Boucai, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law and an expert on mental health and other social issues in courtrooms. Those defenses are successful in even fewer cases; in fact, such a tactic often backfires or results in a defendant confined for a longer term inside a hospital than that person would have spent in prison, sometimes with no end date. And even rarer\u2014though not unheard of\u2014is an attempt to use racism or other bigotry as an indicator of mental-health challenges, he says. \u201cI think it would be extremely hard,\u201d says Boucai, \u201cI mean extremely hard, to succeed on the theory that extreme racism per se\u2014particularly subscription to a theory\u2014is a mental illness for the purpose of criminal responsibility. Just because you have a psychologist or psychiatrist saying this person is mentally ill does not mean the law has to [accept] that.\u201d (Nor does the defendant: Dylann Roof, the white man who shot and killed nine Black worshippers inside a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015\u2014whose legal team used words like \u201cdelusional,\u201d \u201cabnormal,\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d to describe their client\u2014rejected advice from his lawyers to attempt to avoid the death penalty by allowing them to argue that he was insane or suffering from a mental defect at the time of the shooting.) Some fear that raising mental-health issues in court runs the risk of bolstering inaccurate myths about the mentally ill. In reality, mentally ill people are disproportionately more likely to become the victims of crime, and most do nothing to victimize others. And, as has been observed after so many headlinemaking crimes, suspects from privileged groups are more likely to have their actions described as illness in need of treatment instead of criminal evil meriting punishment. Some experts fear that shifting the conversation to questions of mental health can also draw attention away from hateful ideas embraced by the person accused of the crime\u2014ideas that are today often shared by people, including public figures, whose mental health is not questioned. That\u2019s how important social problems that require the nation\u2019s attention are transformed into one individual\u2019s medical problems, says W. Carson Byrd, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. Column: We Need to Take Action to Address the Mental Health Crisis in This Pandemic That line of thinking is particularly problematic in a culture prone to dismiss the need for systemwide reforms to address inequality, Byrd says. It can foster an emphasis on quick fixes for the world\u2019s long-standing problems with bigotry. (In 2012, for example, a team of British researchers announced that an existing heart and blood-pressure drug appeared to reduce implicit bias after a study involving just 36 subjects.) \u201cWhite supremacy is a very normal part of society,\u201d says Byrd, who is also the faculty director of research initiatives at his university\u2019s National Center for Institutional Diversity. It is not a good or productive part of society, he points out, but a deeply entrenched one. \u201cOne of the detriments of trying to look at racism as a form of psychopathology or mental illness is that it makes that [illness] abhorrent, as if everything else is working in a certain [non-racist] way.\u201d Research has also long shown that bigotry is not an inborn human trait, but rather something learned from our environments, Byrd says. While racism can influence one\u2019s mental health, describing racism itself\u2014even \u201cextreme racism\u201d\u2014as a mental illness implies that bigotry exists beyond our individual and collective control. \u201cBy medicalizing [extreme racism], making it something curable, a mental-health disorder, it pulls away from having those broader conversations about how society is impacting people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just try to figure out, \u2018How do we fix this one person?\u2019\u201d This problem, Boucai notes, can already be clearly seen in discussions about gun crime, and mass shootings in particular: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to understand these crimes and the discourse of insanity provides one way to do it,\u201d says Boucai. \u201cBut I think we can see where that sort of language is irresponsible and potentially undermines a just result.\u201d In other words, if a mass shooter is simply insane, then wholesale gun-law reform can, to some, seem unnecessary, even unwise. When bigotry is involved, that supposed insanity might, some who oppose Poussaint\u2019s ideas believe, undermine systemwide efforts toward equity\u2014or at least toward greater safety for those most likely to be targeted. In 1999, when Poussaint wrote his op-ed advocating for increased research into possible psychiatric treatments for extreme racism, he was the author of acclaimed books about the effects of racism on Black mental health and a veteran of public controversy. Years earlier he\u2019d argued publicly that racial pride among Black Americans could be taken to an unhealthy extreme. By the 1990s, he may have been best known for his work with Bill Cosby, consulting on scripts for The Cosby Show in a massively popular effort to disrupt stereotypes. Poussaint first published his ideas about extreme racism weeks after a man named Buford O. Furrow Jr. shot and seriously injured four children and an adult inside a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, then shot and killed a nearby Asian-American postal worker. When captured and ultimately convicted, Furrow told investigators his actions had been motivated by hate. Reporters unearthed information indicating that Furrow had close relationships with known white nationalists, and also that he had been evaluated by Washington State\u2019s mental-health system only months before the attack. He\u2019d even told officials after a previous arrest for assault that he\u2019d \u201cfantasized,\u201d about mass murder. To Poussaint, this story signaled a growing threat posed by a failure to recognize that, while highlighting and combating systemic racism is important in preventing discrimination, so is identifying and helping individuals motivated by bigotry who might go so far as to injure or kill others. Read more: 11 People Were Killed in 48 Hours in Mass Shootings Across America. It\u2019s Likely to Get Worse The idea had been brewing for years. In 1993, a Jamaican immigrant named Colin Ferguson had shot and killed six people and injured 19 aboard a New York commuter train after years of personal struggles that he blamed on white and Asian people, whom he referred to as \u201cdevils.\u201d Ferguson had been pinned down by passengers on the train to stop the shooting but, while defending himself at trial, he argued that someone else committed the crime. (Ferguson\u2019s lawyers had planned to argue that he was insane at the time, suffering from something called \u201cBlack rage,\u201d another condition debated but not officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and that was the subject of a Law & Order episode.) After the train shootings, Poussaint\u2014a Haitian-American son of immigrants\u2014had noted Ferguson\u2019s trajectory: racist thinking, delusions that had come to dominate his life, then mass violence. This was a textbook case of extreme racism. \u201cExtreme racism crosses the line and is out of control,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust like somebody can have a little bit of anxiety, but if they have anxiety to the point that it is immobilizing, then it is a mental disorder.\u201d Mass shooters behind hate crimes are, as he sees it, in a similar state: \u201c[They] weren\u2019t functioning individuals. They were impaired by their mental pathology.\u201d When the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the guide that mental-health professionals use to make their diagnoses, was published in 1980, clinicians like Poussaint considered racism\u2014not extreme racism, but what he calls everyday racism\u2014a potential symptom of several conditions, from paranoid personality disorder to generalized anxiety disorder. Racism alone is not sufficient to diagnose a patient with one of those conditions, but an extreme racist, Poussaint says, likely suffers from delusions. Such people live with multiple symptoms including paranoia; they are likely to project negative traits or outcomes onto entire groups and sustain those beliefs even in the face of strong countervailing evidence. Many embrace conspiracy theories. Some may grow violent. In fact, Poussaint argued in a 2002 Western Journal of Medicine article, the extreme racist often begins with \u201cverbal expression of antagonism, progresses to avoidance of members of disliked groups, then to active discrimination against them, to physical attack, and finally to extermination (lynchings, massacres, genocide). That fifth point on the scale, the acting out of extermination fantasies, is readily classifiable as delusional behavior.\u201d Poussaint was not the first person to raise the idea that extreme racism is itself a mental illness. But he was among those leading the call for the American Psychiatric Association, publishers of the DSM, to consider putting it in subsequent editions of the manual, which has a long history of evolving, often slowly, in response to research and norms. When his op-ed ran, it seemed to Poussaint, people pounced. Some of his fellow Black psychiatrists argued that such a diagnosis would unleash a wave of legal excuse-making, helping no one but the violent racists themselves. Poussaint counters that other health diagnoses have yet\u2014nearly 200 years after psychological concerns officially entered American courtrooms\u2014to produce rafts of acquittals. And some clinicians and researchers argued that there are other ways of attacking racism besides treating it as an illness\u2014educational programs, diversity initiatives, policy changes. That\u2019s a point Poussaint says he doesn\u2019t oppose, at least when it comes to everyday racism. Those steps can help racists who embrace repugnant ideas while remaining functional parts of society. But those aren\u2019t the people he\u2019s talking about. \u201cRacism negatively impacts public health,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association told TIME in a statement. \u201cThe American Psychiatric Association has been focusing on this in the DSM by identifying and addressing the impact of structural racism on the over- or underdiagnosis of mental disorders in certain ethno-racial groups. From time to time we have received proposals to create a diagnosis of extreme racism but they have not met the criteria identified for creating new disorders.\u201d To this day, Poussaint believes that extreme racism is very likely its own disorder in need of study, possible diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment, he told me in September from his home in Massachusetts. But after retiring about 2\u00bd years ago at the age of 86, he says he\u2019s too far out of the professional mix to continue to push for an extreme racism diagnosis. I ask Poussaint what he thinks might have happened if extreme racism had become its own diagnosable condition listed in the DSM. Extreme racism might have been a topic on talk shows and a more frequent topic of news coverage, he says. With research and public information campaigns, the need for intervention could have been as clear as it is for heart attacks; the steps to do so as well-known as CPR. \u201cWe\u2019d get away from treating it as if [extreme racism] is normative,\u201d Poussaint says, \u201clike a cultural difference because America is a racist country. We have made it normative by not calling it what it is. Even people in general society, friends and relatives and even the afflicted individual, would recognize it as a disorder and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alright.\u2019 People who get swept up by anxiety and can\u2019t function, they don\u2019t think they are normal. They say, \u2018This is taking over my life. I need some help.\u2019 [A diagnosis] clues the family to say, \u2018This person is really troubled and we have to get them some help.\u2019\u201d \u2014with reporting by Solcyre Burga, Mariah Espada and Simmone Shah",

        "title": "Deep-Sea Mining Risks More Than Just The Environment",
        "content": "(To get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.) At the last minute of the recent International Seabed Authority meeting in Jamaica (which ended July 29), negotiators representing countries around the world decided to postpone a decision on the most important point of debate at the gatherings. That is, whether and how companies can mine the bottom of the ocean for critical minerals needed for the energy transition. The debate has largely centered on just how bad deep-sea mining would be for underwater life. Opponents say that the practice risks destroying untouched marine ecosystems; supporters argue that the extraction technology is relatively light touch and that any damage underwater would be better than damage to terrestrial ecosystems. It is, at its core, a moral argument with the economic and financial case for deep-sea mining almost taken for granted. So I want to take a minute here to look at some of the economic and financial elements at play. Deep-sea mining is one of many sectors in the clean technology space that should make businesses and investors think differently about risks and returns. Read more: This Mining Executive Is Fighting Her Own Industry to Protect the Environment Deep-sea mining is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The technology is unproven, and some experts have argued it will be too expensive to compete in the current rare-earth-mineral marketplace. This could very well mean financial devastation for the companies that pursue it. Still, it seems fair to say that a significant potential financial\u2014and societal\u2014upside remains if mining projects are well executed. As the energy transition accelerates, the rapidly growing demand for critical minerals like manganese and cobalt is enormous. That could mean returns for investors and a vast supply of minerals for the green economy. The high financial-risk-and-reward nature of deep-sea mining isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing in and of itself. Indeed, high-risk investments are often celebrated in the climate technology space. Think of the investors who helped Tesla get off the ground\u2014and made a killing doing so\u2014or the slew of startups financed by high-profile investors like Bill Gates. To a certain extent, we need investors who are willing to take on financial risk to help catalyze new clean technologies. But there\u2019s a key way in which the downside of deep-sea mining is different from most other high-risk investments. In exploiting the ocean floor, mining companies open themselves up to enormous environmental liability that extends far beyond many other highly speculative investments. Potentially destroying marine ecosystems, contributing to species extinction, and destroying so-called natural capital all have the potential to cause damage that costs the planet trillions of dollars. It\u2019s not a big stretch to imagine those liability costs exceeding the value of deep-sea mining companies. In an extensive section of its regulatory filings, The Metals Company, the best-known deep-sea mining company, warns investors that environmental rules, both those that exist today and that may be on the books soon, \u201ccould limit or prevent our ability to continue our operations as currently contemplated or to undertake new operations.\u201d That\u2019s particularly the case as policymakers push for new ways to account for the value of natural capital. This includes things like biodiversity and ocean life, which underpin our economy but aren\u2019t considered in our traditional forms of accounting. Read more: Deep-Sea Mining Isn't a Viable Climate Solution An investor may look at this and say, \"so what?\" Most venture investments don\u2019t pan out, and it would be easy to write off an investment in a deep-sea mining company if the economics don\u2019t work out. But there are reputational risks, too, that could seriously impact the bottom line as companies and investors try to portray themselves as sustainable in the marketplace. A report from the United Nations Environment Program warns, for example, that companies that invest in deep-sea mining may find other companies less willing to do business with them. And as demand for sustainable investment products continues, investors financing deep-sea mining risk losing credibility. \u201cThere is no foreseeable way in which the financing of deep-sea mining activities can be viewed as consistent with the Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Principles,\u201d the report reads, referring to U.N. investment principles designed to protect oceans. Deep-sea mining is just one technology, but as the need to address climate change grows in urgency it surely won\u2019t be the only one with a similar risk-reward profile. Geoengineering, for example, presents the opportunity to help humans slow some of the effects of climate change\u2014but the cost of the side effects remain unknown. Sooner or later, these technologies may force businesses and investors to weigh risks and returns a little differently.",

        "content": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME\u2019s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. The criminal indictment of ex-President Donald Trump for his alleged attempts to subvert democracy and incite the Jan. 6, 2021, melee in Washington has been a long time coming. Now that it\u2019s here, two-and-a-half years after a mob listened to Trump, marched about a mile eastward, and ransacked the U.S. Capitol in service of his lies about a stolen 2020 election, it hits a little different than the charges previously brought against Trump. A federal grand jury on Tuesday charged Trump with an alleged conspiracy to defraud the United States, a conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and a conspiracy against voting rights. The charges are a remarkable escalation of the legal troubles chasing Trump during what he hopes is a brief return to civilian life. Trump, who is running for President again in 2024 and is the runaway front-runner in the Republican field, could face years in prison if convicted. Now Trump has made history once again, becoming a thrice-indicted ex-Commander in Chief. Well, at least if the normal rules of political gravity still matter. History is being made, but not all history is good. It was a day a lot of the folks who experienced the attack in Washington on Jan. 6 had been seeking for a long time. The wall-to-wall coverage on cable, the constant refreshes of social-media sites, and even the text chains around Capitol Hill all reflected an anxiety that this may be a false start. It will be similar when Trump is due in court on Thursday in D.C. Politicos of both parties in D.C. watched in horror more than two years ago as a riot descended on Capitol Hill, the mob raiding offices, menacing lawmakers, and fighting hand-to-hand combat with police. The top leadership of both chambers followed evacuation protocols to make sure their branch of government wouldn\u2019t be decapitated. Vice President Mike Pence was pinned down and forced to hide at a loading dock while White House aides unsuccessfully lobbied Trump to direct his legion of followers to stop terrorizing democracy. Partisanship fades when Hill staffers talk about that day, even if many of their bosses have publicly retreated from prior criticism of Trump and sought to shade the painful facts. The Trump years numbed the country to the word \u201cunprecedented,\u201d amid the constant reverberations of history being made. From the day Trump took office as the only person ever elected to the presidency with zero government or military experience, around every corner came norm-breaking and precedent-smashing. His tweets broke the fourth wall, he was the only President impeached twice, became the first in 150 years to refuse to attend his successor\u2019s inauguration, and his Administration paid so little heed to laws prohibiting politicking on the government dime that he held the Republican convention on the South Lawn of the White House.  Trump\u2019s team has already started telling allies on the Hill that these latest indictments will not matter at all for his reelection hopes. Republicans cite \u201cindictment fatigue,\u201d hoping to plant the idea that voters don\u2019t much care about it and have already accepted that Trump is a bad dude who doesn\u2019t play by the rules. It\u2019s going to be \u201cOld News!\u201d on the socials and \u201cWitch Hunt!\u201d in the hallways. The messaging leaves responsible conservatives squeamish, but they\u2019ll still carry it for fear of being branded insufficiently MAGA, and thus vulnerable in a primary from someone who wears the red hat proudly. Trump\u2019s past two indictments suggest this one may, perversely, benefit him as well. The aftermath of those charges\u2014totaling at least 78 felony allegations and counting\u2014brought a fundraising boon and a polling surge. That\u2019s right: the self-described billionaire will collect millions in donations from his fans who see the real estate mogul as a victim of a weaponized Justice Department. His best days of fundraising have been his worst ones legally. It\u2019s worth taking a beat to appreciate how casually we all blew through the phrase \u201cpast two indictments\u201d in the previous paragraph. And the fact that a former President now accused of a \u201cconspiracy to defraud the United States\u201d remains the frontrunner for the Republican Party\u2019s re-nomination next year. A thrice-indicted, convicted sexual abuser, alleged election interferer and wealth fabulist is on course to coast to the general election, past capable governors, investors, ambassadors, and even his own former Vice President. Trump could still return to power facing federal charges and, in turn, dodge accountability for any of his alleged misdeeds. (This is why the state-based cases, where Trump will lack pardon powers, may be the real places to watch.) But that doesn\u2019t mean the next year-plus will be easy for Trump. His troubles are as epic as they are history-making\u2014and, maybe, incompatible with his campaign schedule. Trump is due in court in October to answer a $250 million civil lawsuit brought by the New York Attorney General on allegations the Trumps falsified business records. He is scheduled to begin a New York County criminal trial in March of next year on 34 charges that he falsified Trump Organization business records to pay off a porn star. A federal judge ruled on July 19 the case in Manhattan should continue there, and not be moved into the federal track. Trump was arraigned last month on charges he had classified documents at his Florida vacation club and defied subpoenas to return them, a case also brought by special counsel Smith. He pleaded not guilty to 37 charges. Another three were added last week. A trial date could start in May in Florida. And, as of Tuesday, he could be facing criminal charges in a D.C. federal court on charges linked to Jan. 6.  On top of all of this, Trump faces potential criminal charges of election tampering in Georgia for a call asking the state\u2019s balloting chief to change the winner; an indictment has been considered imminent in a county-based case since February, and a new grand jury was seated last week. A decision, it seems, is imminent. Yet, somehow, there remains a better-than-even-odds chance he squirms out of any consequences, which would leave a lot of the witnesses to the chaos of Jan. 6 deeply skeptical about the evenhandedness of the criminal justice system if not dejected and cynical. After all, a high-wattage series of congressional hearings last year into Trump\u2019s conduct surrounding the riot resulted in a collective shrug, and two impeachment trials\u2014one of which was also about Jan. 6\u2014failed to deliver convictions. Those earlier indictments cut some parts of Trump\u2019s clout down to size. But those haven\u2019t yet been enough to take him down, because Presidents stand like giants. That may be changing, as instead of standing with Sequoia-like titans like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, the Trump sapling is being cut into a stump. With this latest indictment, which is a federal criminal probe that goes beyond fibbing on tax forms and mishandling spycraft files and includes a bodycount, Trump has few chances to rise to his predecessor\u2019s heights, at least beyond a shady corner of his partisan bonfire. It\u2019s why Tuesday\u2019s indictment is not like the earlier ones: it may be the one cited in the first line of future history books. He may well dodge jail time, but even the one-time most-powerful person on the planet cannot escape the accountability of historians. Make sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C.

        "content": "It almost ended, for the Americans, in a flash. It should have ended, for the Americans, in a flash. All night on Tuesday in Auckland, Portugal had outplayed the U.S. Women\u2019s National Soccer Team (USWNT) in the final group stage game for both teams at the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup. A Portugal win would send that team through to the Round of 16 in its World Cup debut\u2014and the USWNT home before the knockout stage for the first time in its history. That would be the biggest upset in women\u2019s World Cup history. And early in second-half stoppage time, the game still scoreless, Portugal had a chance to seal it. Portugal\u2019s Telma Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o headed a ball forward to Ana Capeta, who had just entered the game and slipped between U.S. defenders Emily Sonnett and Emily Fox. Her look at the top of the box was clean, and it looked true. She sent the ball past U.S. keeper Alyssa Naeher, who dove to her right but had no chance to save it. Capeta\u2019s shot, and Portugal\u2019s dreams, bounded off the right post. The Americans were saved by a metal bar. If Capeta directed it just a few more inches to the left, the USWNT was going home. Sign up for \u2018Extra Time,\u2019 our new newsletter that will break down the biggest moments from the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup What a disappointing effort from the Americans. As the Netherlands kept scoring goals against Vietnam on Tuesday in the simultaneous other final game in the group, and as Portugal kept controlling possession against the U.S.\u2014breaking through the American defense at one point in the first half, nearly sneaking in a goal\u2014and as Rose Lavelle earned a questionable yellow card for a tackle (knocking her out of the next game), and as the second half started and the story still felt the same, and as the Portugal attempt richocheted off the post in that terrifying stoppage-time moment, one thing became very clear: The United States might advance to the knockout stage of this 2023 World Cup. But other than that\u2014and granted, it\u2019s quite a key \u201cthat\u201d\u2014this game against Portugal in Auckland could not have turned out any worse for the U.S. The U.S. and Portugal played to a 0-0 draw, so the Americans do advance to the Round of 16. But for just the second time in the history of the women\u2019s World Cup, the U.S. did not win its group. The Netherlands secured two victories in this Group E round-robin: a 7-0 thumping of Vietnam on Tuesday and a 1-0 victory over Portugal on July 23. The U.S., meanwhile, has just one win: a 3-0 victory over Vietnam on July 21. So the USWNT goes to Melbourne, to play the winner of Group G, most likely a tough Sweden side that already has the statement victory the Americans so desperately lack: a 5-0 win over Italy on July 29. That knockout match kicks off on Sunday, August 6th, at 5 a.m. If the U.S. plays as flatly and uninspiring as it did Tuesday, no way the Americans beat the Swedes.  The USWNT entered this World Cup as the betting favorite, but at this point, this team looks anything but. Where was the urgency and creativity on Tuesday? What was the game plan? Just playing for a 0-0 draw was all too dangerous. Yes, that outcome would get the U.S. through to the next round. But it was the mere minimum, the strategy of a team just trying to sneak into the knockout stage in its World Cup debut\u2014like Portugal\u2014 not the four-time World Cup champions.  Just one goal against a team that the USWNT has historically dominated would at least have given the American players some breathing room and not leave them susceptible to the unimaginable, like what happened in that 91st minute: Capeta\u2019s clear look, the need for the goal post to play savior.  Or what happened in the 80th minute: a silly U.S. turnover resulting in a Carole Costa shot that slipped out of Naeher\u2019s hands, right in front of the goal. Again, for a moment, the USWNT\u2019s World Cup seemed in peril, for that flash. Luckily for Naeher and the Americans, the U.S. defense surrounded the ball, which Naeher fell on. Portugal controlled possession of the ball for 43% of the game, compared to 39% for the USWNT, and Portugal completed 310 passes, to 212 for the Americans: Portugal was crisper and more organized.  Portugal should still be playing in this World Cup. The Americans shouldn\u2019t. The USWNT has to bear this mental burden. The trick: wiping it clear out of their minds, and starting with a blank slate on Sunday. Yes, the group stage failings don\u2019t really matter anymore\u2014except for Lavelle\u2019s second yellow. She\u2019s been a spark, but now she can\u2019t play on Sunday. The U.S. has to turn things around, fast. Nothing so far has suggested the Americans deserve any breaks in Australia. When the Americans couldn\u2019t convert so many chances against Vietnam, for example, coach Vlatko Andonovski harped on the positive: at least the U.S. did its job and secured the three points.  The U.S. beat Vietnam 3-0. The Netherlands beat them 7-0. That\u2019s how you take care of business. That\u2019s how you win your group.  When veteran Kelley O\u2019Hara checked into the game in the very last moments, she pointed to her head. Be smart, she was telling her teammates. It\u2019s so concerning for the Americans that such a message had to be sent. At that point, just taking care of the ball for a few more seconds, and surviving the group and getting out of Auckland with a 0-0 draw, was the prudent strategy. But the Americans were still messing around.  The final whistle then blew. Mercifully.  The USWNT was granted second life here. Now what will they do with it?",

        "content": "The suspense, and tearing of tickets, continues: No one won Friday\u2019s Mega Millions jackpot, sending the estimated prize to a historic $1.55 billion, according to its website. If the estimate is correct, the top prize will beat the previous record of $1.537 billion that was won by someone who bought a ticket in South Carolina in 2018. The winning numbers in Friday night\u2019s drawing were 11-30-45-52-56 with a Mega Ball of 20. The last time the jackpot was won was in a drawing on April 18. In Mega Millions, the jackpot rolls over each time there is a drawing and the jackpot is not won. Mega Millions crossed the $1 billion mark last weekend. It's the fifth time that the top prize has passed $1 billion. Going into Friday's drawing, this current jackpot was $1.35 billion and in second place among the game's top jackpots ever, game officials said. The next drawing is Tuesday. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are 1 in 302,575,350. (There are other prizes, so don\u2019t tear those tickets just yet.) The game is played in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",

        "content": "Greta Gerwig should be feeling closer to fine these days. In just three weeks in theaters, \u201cBarbie\u201d is set to sail past $1 billion in global ticket sales, breaking a record for female directors that was previously held by Patty Jenkins, who helmed \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d \u201cBarbie,\u201d which Gerwig directed and co-wrote, added another $53 million from 4,178 North American locations this weekend according to studio estimates on Sunday. The Margot Robbie-led and produced film has been comfortably seated in first place for three weeks and it\u2019s hardly finished yet. Warner Bros. said the film will cross $1 billion before the end of the day. In modern box office history, just 53 movies have made over $1 billion, not accounting for inflation, and \u201cBarbie\u201d is now the biggest to be directed by one woman, supplanting \u201cWonder Woman\u2019s\u201d $821.8 million global total. Three movies that were co-directed by women are still ahead of \u201cBarbie,\u201d including \u201cFrozen\u201d ($1.3 billion) and \u201cFrozen 2\u201d ($1.45 billion) both co-directed by Jennifer Lee and \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d ($1.1 billion), co-directed by Anna Boden. But, \u201cBarbie\u201d has passed \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d domestically with $459.4 million (versus $426.8 million), thereby claiming the North American record for live-action movies directed by women. New competition came this weekend in the form of the animated, PG-rated \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\u201d and the Jason Statham shark sequel, \u201cMeg 2: The Trench,\u201d both of which were neck-in-neck with Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d also in its third weekend, for the second-place spot. \u201cMeg 2\u201d managed to sneak ahead and land in second place. It overcame its abysmal reviews to score a $30 million opening weekend from 3,503 locations. The Warner Bros. release, directed by Ben Wheatley, currently has a 29% critics\u2019 score on Rotten Tomatoes and a B- CinemaScore from audiences. The thriller was released in 3D, which accounted for 22% of its first weekend business. Third place went to \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which added $28.7 million from 3,612 locations in North America, bringing its domestic total to $228.6 million. In just three weeks, the J. Robert Oppenheimer biopic starring Cillian Murphy has become the highest grossing R-rated film of the year (ahead of \u201cJohn Wick Chapter 4\u201d) and the sixth-biggest of the year overall, surpassing \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\u201d \u201cOppenheimer\u201d also celebrated a landmark, crossing $500 million globally in three weeks. Its worldwide tally is currently $552.9 million, which puts it ahead of \u201cDunkirk,\u201d which clocked out with $527 million in 2017, and has become Nolan\u2019s fifth-biggest movie ever. It\u2019s also now among the four top grossing biographies ever (company includes \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d and \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d) and the biggest World War II movie of all time. Paramount\u2019s \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d was close behind in fourth place with an estimated $28 million from 3,858 theaters in North America. Since opening on Wednesday, the film, which is riding on excellent reviews (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores, has earned $43.1 million. \u201cThis is one of those movies that is a multigenerational joy,\u201d said Chris Aronson, Paramount\u2019s president of domestic distribution. \u201cI think the enduring popularity of \u2018Turtles\u2019 is showing its true colors. And there hasn\u2019t been an animated film in eight weeks and there won\u2019t be another for eight weeks which is great for us.\u201d \u201cTurtles\u201d cost $70 million to produce and features a starry voice cast that includes Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd, Ayo Edebiri and Seth Rogen, who produced and co-wrote the film, which leans into the \u201cteenage\u201d aspect of the turtles. \u201cBarbie,\u201d \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and even the surprise, anti-trafficking hit \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d (now at $163.5 million and ahead of \u201cMission: Impossible 7\u201d) have helped fuel a boom at the box office, bringing in many millions more than was expected and helping to offset pains caused by some summer disappointments. \u201cAfter \u2018The Flash,\u2019 \u2018Indiana Jones\u2019 and, to a certain extent, \u2018Mission: Impossible,\u2019 people were saying the summer was a disappointment. But it\u2019s not over yet,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a summer that is going to go out on a high note.\u201d But the moment of triumph for the industry will likely be short lived if the studios can\u2019t reach an agreement with striking actors and writers soon. The fall release calendar has already gotten slimmer, with some studios pushing films into 2024 instead of trying to promote them without movie stars. Sony had planned to release its PlayStation-inspired true story \u201cGran Turismo\u201d in theaters nationwide next Friday, but will now be rolling it out slowly for two weeks before going wide on Aug. 25. The thinking? If movie stars can\u2019t promote the film, maybe audiences can. \u201cWe have to be realistic,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWe\u2019re on this emotional high of movies doing so well, but we have to temper our enthusiasm and optimism with the fact that the strike is creating a lot of uncertainty. The longer it goes on the more profound the issues become. But the audience has spoken and they love going to the movie theater.\u201d Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. \u201cBarbie,\u201d $53 million. 2. \u201cMeg 2: The Trench,\u201d $30 million. 3. \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d $28.7 million. 4. \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,\u201d $28 million. 5. \u201cHaunted Mansion,\u201d $9 million. 6. \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d $7 million. 7. \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part I,\u201d $6.5 million. 8. \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d $6.3 million. 9. \u201cRocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani,\u201d $1.5 million. 10. \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\u201d $1.5 million.",

        "content": "While Texas Gov. Greg Abbott places buoys in the Rio Grande to make it harder for migrants to cross into his state, a growing number of migrants have braved record-breaking heat and dangerous terrain to cross into Arizona.  Long considered the most dangerous area to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, the Tucson sector is now also its busiest. On average, more than 1,300 migrants cross daily despite temperatures that regularly top 100 degrees, according to Customs and Border Protection data obtained by NBC News.  \u201cThis is a very rough, rough entrance into the United States,\u201d said Jim Chilton, a rancher in Arivaca, Arizona, who regularly sees migrants cross his 50,000 acres of land.  \u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse,\u201d he said, noting a seemingly undeterred migrant population traversing his ranch. Most of the migrants trying to cross Chilton\u2019s property are single adult men trying to evade detection by Border Patrol. But in other areas, like around Nogales, families with young children are turning themselves in to agents to seek asylum.  NBC News recently traveled with Border Patrol agents in Nogales as they apprehended a group of 20 women and children who had crossed the border early in the morning, when the air was still cool.  One mother traveling with her 16-year-old son said they had been sleeping in the mountains and decided to turn themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol because they were exhausted and had nothing to eat.  The increase in families is especially concerning to Border Patrol agents and rescue workers, given this summer\u2019s temperatures. Agent Ronaldo Rios, the acting director of the Arizona Air Coordination Center, told NBC News he has seen groups crossing with more than 200 women and children, including babies and toddlers.  \u201cThe common hazard that folks are hearing about is going to be the heat,\" said Rios. \"Exposure to the elements \u2014 being out in our terrain or mountainous terrain for long periods of time \u2014 without any water.\u201d John Russell, an air interdiction agent who flies Black Hawk helicopters for Customs and Border Protection\u2019s Air and Marine operations, said that his unit recently received 26 calls for help in a single day. Many migrants who were trying to cross the border in remote terrain called for help during the first storm of southern Arizona\u2019s annual monsoon season.  Calls to 911 \u201cstarted rolling in,\u201d said Russell. \u201cThere were three that we weren\u2019t able to get to due to weather, aircraft availability. One of those was later found deceased. He didn\u2019t make it. He succumbed to the weather.\u201d Department of Homeland Security officials are worried about the overall rise in families crossing the border as well. In Tucson, in particular, the rise in families could mean more migrant deaths.  \"We are seeing very little kids that need water,\u201d said Alejandro Avirde, a border patrol agent. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this hike for five hours, and they\u2019re in need of water.\u201d CORRECTION (Aug. 5, 2023, 12:12 p.m. ET) A previous version of this article misstated John Russell\u2019s title. He is an air interdiction agent, not a Border Patrol agent. ",

Newsom's team Saturday slammed DeSantis' proposed rules for their debate on Fox News. \u201cWhat a joke,\" Newsom spokesman Nathan Click said in a statement in response to the proposal that DeSantis' team sent Fox News host Sean Hannity on Friday. \"Desantis\u2019 counterproposal is littered with crutches to hide his insecurity and ineptitude \u2014 swapping opening statements with a hype video, cutting down the time he needs to be on stage, adding cheat notes and a cheering section,\" Click said. \"Ron should be able to stand on his own two feet. It\u2019s no wonder Trump is kicking his ass.\u201d DeSantis' team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. DeSantis, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination, told Hannity on Wednesday that he would be willing to debate Newsom, a Democrat with whom he has frequently clashed over issues like guns, abortion, education and immigration. \u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m game. Let\u2019s get it done. Just tell me when and where. We\u2019ll do it,\u201d DeSantis said, agreeing to the debate idea that initially came about in June, when Hannity asked Newsom whether he'd debate DeSantis. Newsom sent a formal debate offer letter to Hannity last month that included rules such as that the debate would be moderated by Hannity, be broadcast live and be 90 minutes in length and that both governors wouldn\u2019t use notes. Newsom also proposed Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina as potential locations. In a letter to Hannity dated Friday, DeSantis' team offered its own rules, which diverged from some proposed by Newsom. Some of the differences: Hannity framed the event Wednesday as a \u201cpolicy-based debate\u201d between the heads of a red state and a blue state, but DeSantis has said the debate will be far more than that. \u201cThis is the debate for the future of our country,\" he told Hannity.",

        "title": "Special counsel cites threatening Trump post in request for protective order in election interference case",
        "content": "Federal prosecutors on Friday asked the judge overseeing former President Donald Trump's election interference case to bar him from publicly disclosing some of the evidence gathered during their investigation. In a court filing, attorneys with the special counsel Jack Smith's office requested that U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan ensure that sensitive materials are used by Trump's defense team for only the trial, and that the former president view the materials in the presence of his lawyers. \u201cAll the proposed order seeks to prevent is the improper dissemination or use of discovery materials, including to the public,\u201d they wrote. \"Such a restriction is particularly important in this case because the defendant has previously issued public statements on social media regarding witnesses, judges, attorneys and others associated with legal matters pending against him.\" Trump, who was arraigned Thursday on charges that included conspiracy to defraud the United States, pleaded not guilty and has publicly condemned the allegations against him. Prosecutors went on to say that Trump had written \"multiple posts\" that mentioned or implied the case, including one that appeared on his Truth Social page Friday afternoon that read: \u201cIF YOU GO AFTER ME, I\u2019M COMING AFTER YOU!\" Trump's use of details or grand jury transcripts obtained in discovery \"could have a harmful chilling effect on witnesses or adversely affect the fair administration of justice in this case,\" the prosecutors wrote. In a statement early Saturday, a Trump spokesperson said, \"The Truth post cited is the definition of political speech,\" and that it \"was in response to the RINO, China-loving, dishonest special interest groups and Super PACs.\" During Thursday's court hearing, Magistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya gave Trump a warning that is not typically issued to defendants at arraignments. \u201cFinally, sir, I want to remind you that it is a crime to try to influence a juror, or to threaten or attempt to bribe a witness or any other person who may have information about your case, or to retaliate against anyone for providing information about your case to the prosecution, or to otherwise obstruct the administration of justice,\u201d she said. A lawyer for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday night. Chutkan has ordered Trump\u2019s attorneys to respond to the government\u2019s motion for a protective order, stating their position on the matter by 5 p.m. on Monday. They are expected to respond, much like in the other cases in which Trump has been indicted. In June, a federal judge issued a protective order barring Trump from disclosing on social media \u2014 or keeping \u2014 evidence the government is set to turn over to him in the classified documents case. A protective order was also issued in Trump's criminal hush-money case in New York in which prosecutors asked a judge to ensure that discovery materials in that case be used by defense only for trial, and referred to the former president's \"longstanding and perhaps singular history of attacking witnesses.\" The next hearing in the election case is scheduled for Aug. 28.",

        "title": "Delays in federal workers\u2019 comp can stall medical care, turning injuries into disabilities",
        "content": "Injured federal employees say their treatable injuries are at risk of progressing into lifelong disabilities because the workers' compensation program that covers their medical costs and procedures is clogged by low staffing, convoluted processes and an increase in claims. Workers and their advocates say filing a claim is a knotty experience of complicated paperwork and slow response times and, in some extreme cases, it can take years to get an approval. Joshua Lejeune, 33, is one of those workers. He needs surgery after injuring his knee while on patrol as a police officer at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Louisiana last year and is still waiting for approval. Since filing the workers' compensation claim in March 2022, he has been unable to safely carry his infant daughter up the stairs of his home. Because it's a workers' compensation case, his insurance won\u2019t cover his procedure and doctors are unable to work on his knee without an approved claim. The longer he waits, the more at risk he is for a complete knee replacement, he said doctors have told him.  \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Lejeune, who can\u2019t afford the $50,000 out-of-pocket estimate for the procedure and who has lost work and employment opportunities because of the injury. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete nightmare.\u201d And he isn\u2019t the only one experiencing this nightmare. The process has created delays for countless employees across the federal government\u2019s numerous agencies, union officials and labor attorneys said. From the Federal Bureau of Prisons to the U.S. Postal Service, federal workers and their advocates described a Byzantine process that they received little help to navigate. And while their doctors might tell them a procedure or scan is necessary, it can take weeks or months to receive approval from the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, or OWCP, an agency that falls under the Labor Department.  OWCP said it is working readily to remedy concerns. \u201cOWCP is deeply committed to providing federal workers injured or sickened on the job the benefits they\u2019re entitled to in a timely manner. The current administration has taken many actions to strengthen the FECA program and we will continue to find new ways to make the program work better for those filing a claim,\u201d OWCP Director Chris Godfrey said in a statement, referring to the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act. \u2018A tremendous problem\u2019 Joe Mansour, the workers' compensation specialist at the country\u2019s largest federal employee union, the American Federation of Government Employees, said he has been brought in to work on almost 1,000 cases since the start of the year because of delays and other issues. He emphasized that the union has contended with the problem under both Democrats and Republicans in the White House, but it grew particularly difficult under the Trump administration. \u201cMany federal employees I speak to say dealing with workers' comp is one of the most difficult things that they have ever experienced in the government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like the current administration is trying to improve things, but it remains a tremendous problem.\u201d The claims processing workforce shrank while Donald Trump was president, according to data provided by the Labor Department. One of the logjams potentially making the problem worse is that this smaller number of employees has had to tackle a larger number of cases.  The scale of the requests has grown precipitously. The FECA program received 182,303 new injury claims in fiscal year 2022, according to data provided by the Labor Department. That represents a 62% increase over 2013 when it received 112,807 claims.  In response, the Biden administration has increased staffing, hiring 281 new claims examiners and 55 medical treatment adjudicators to make the FECA program work better for claimants, according to the Labor Department data. Staffing levels are slowly climbing back to where they sat almost 10 years ago, and the agency said it has created new processes to escalate inquiries, simplified forms and hired an ombudsperson to investigate specific claims.   Still, claimants said the undertaking can become confrontational when they need to continually check in or involve lawyers to speed up the process. Claims are often denied by case workers, which can cause the entire effort to take much longer. And when it\u2019s a person\u2019s well-being on the line, union leaders and workers emphasized that a time-consuming approval process can take a cruel hold on people\u2019s lives, whether intentional or not.  \u201cIf a case is denied, we can appeal it \u2014 and we do well on appeals,\u201d said a union leader who asked to remain anonymous because the representative works regularly with the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs. \u201cWe get a lot of stuff overturned, but it takes months to do that, and time is not on the workers\u2019 side.\u201d Pete Hobart, 50, a power plant mechanic at the Dalles Dam, which is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the border between Washington and Oregon, hurt a disk in his back while working in February 2022. With little information on how to navigate the process, it took 10 months for him to obtain the approval for surgery.  \u201cNow my lower leg is numb,\u201d he said, adding he believes it is nerve damage caused by waiting for the workers\u2019 compensation approval. \u201cYou know when the doctor beats on your knee and your leg kicks? Mine doesn\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d The hardship of a slow process Federal employees say the process is very complicated and they receive little guidance to navigate the paperwork and requirements. Attorneys and union leaders who have been involved in helping to get claims processed said that delays are not an anomaly of just a few extreme cases but are affecting many claimants. To help members of his union, Mansour holds workshops at sites across the country and online for federal employees because so many people continue to struggle through the process. He has held more than 30 workshops this year, which included an online course last week attended by more than 160 employees.  \u201cAs of now, the agency just does not provide sufficient information to the injured employee,\u201d he said when asked about the need for the workshops. \u201cWhen an employee is injured, they\u2019re on their own.\u201d Two union representatives, each working for a different federal agency, said the problem is so pernicious that they sometimes advise members to file claims under their personal health insurance first and report the workers' compensation claim after they\u2019ve received the necessary help \u2014 or avoid the process altogether.  Attorneys who have worked on federal workers\u2019 compensation claims said that can be problematic, however, as it still requires individuals to come up with copays and deductibles out of pocket that they may not be able to get reimbursed afterward. It can also affect the evidence workers might need to gather to get claims approved.  \u201cPart of the problem in many cases is that once a claim is accepted, private insurance companies won\u2019t typically pay for treatment,\u201d said Aaron Aumiller, an attorney who has worked on federal workers' compensation cases for almost two decades. The wait can be emotionally excruciating, and it often takes an immense toll on individuals involved in the process. Multiple employees described spiraling in negative thoughts as they waited to get claims approved.  Jim Karney, 55, who works as a hydropower plant operator in Idaho, slipped on ice outside the Corps dam he worked at two days before Christmas 2021. The accident, which injured both his shoulders, was recorded by cameras at the plant. After filing an OWCP claim, he was unable to receive approval for an MRI until February 2022, and then only for his left shoulder. The following month his doctor told him that a torn rotator cuff had worsened and had permanently affected the muscle in his left shoulder. He was told that because of the delay, he will never be able to regain strength in his shoulder.  It took five more weeks to be approved for an MRI of his right shoulder, where another rotator cuff tear as well as a bicep tear were identified. Two and a half months later, he was able to get surgery on the right side. The injuries have limited his range of motion. They forced him to sleep in a recliner every night for months, and he still can\u2019t lift a gallon of milk with his left hand. The process, at times, has left him vacillating from tears of self-pity to intense anger and severe depression. He has just learned to cope with the pain emotionally. \u201cI never did feel suicidal, but I really wanted the pain to end,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t willing to go that far, but this process drives your mind that way.\u201d That's a familiar feeling for many, who said they're left to spiral in their pain without a sense of recourse. Lejeune, who quit the VA and is working in sales, said the process presumes that claimants know the workers' compensation program thoroughly. That assumption and his experience has him swearing off government work forever. \"I don't ever want to work for another government agency again,\" he said. \"When I was injured, I had zero help. It's a joke.\"",

        "content": "A white mother who was suspected of trafficking her biracial daughter in October 2021 by Southwest Airlines employees has filed a racial discrimination suit against the company. Mary MacCarthy was traveling to Denver from Los Angeles with her 10-year-old daughter to attend her brother's funeral, she told NBC News nearly two years ago. Upon landing in Denver, MacCarthy and her daughter were confronted by police officers because a flight attendant suspected her of potential human trafficking. A federal lawsuit filed Thursday in the District Court of Colorado accused Southwest Airlines of racial discrimination. MacCarthy accused the airline staff of flagging her as suspicious \"based on a racist assumption about a mixed\u2010race family.\" \"The officers began questioning Ms. MacCarthy and made it clear that they were given the racially charged information that Ms. MacCarthy\u2019s daughter was possibly being trafficked by her simply because Ms. MacCarthy is White and her daughter is Black,\" the lawsuit said. David Lane, the attorney representing MacCarthy, said that the suit is designed to bring accountability and to have the airline re-examine its own training. He said that the use of racial profiling in this case has attempted to address a serious crime with a \"stereotypical, easy formula.\" \"Just as the police are constitutionally not permitted to stop-and-frisk young men of color based upon their race, corporate America is similarly not permitted to resort to such profiling in using law enforcement to stop and question racially diverse families simply based upon their divergent races, which is what Southwest did,\" Lane said in a statement. MacCarthy said that her daughter broke down in tears during the questioning and remains traumatized by the incident almost two years later. In an interview in 2021, MacCarthy said her daughter was \"sobbing\" throughout the encounter. \u201cShe unfortunately already has had charged encounters with police. Any kid\u2019s going to be scared in a situation like this,\u201d MacCarthy said. According to a police report, the flight attendant said she flagged the family as suspicious because they were the last to board the plane and asked other passengers to change seats so they could sit together. The flight attendant didn\u2019t see the mother and daughter speak on the plane and claimed MacCarthy told her daughter not to talk to the flight crew, the report said. MacCarthy denied the claims that she and her daughter didn\u2019t talk on the flight or that she prohibited her daughter from speaking to the flight crew. She also said she was called 10 days after the incident by a human trafficking unit investigator from the Denver Police Department. The incident was closed as \u201cunfounded\u201d with no further action necessary, according to the police report. Southwest Airlines declined to comment on the litigation Sunday. The company said in 2021 that it was conducting a review of the incident, but the airline did not answer questions as to the results of its review on Sunday. The lawsuit demands a jury trial, attorney costs and fees, as well as damages that will be established during trial.",

A Wider Frame, a newsletter that says it aims to provide \"a better overall understanding and scope of Jewish world news,\" shared Foxx's original post and called it \"horrifically antisemitic.\" Actor Jennifer Aniston then re-posted A Wider Frame after she came under fire for seeming to have liked Foxx's post. \"This really makes me sick,\" Aniston wrote in an Instagram Story. \"I did not 'like' this post on purpose or by accident. And more importantly, I want to be clear to my friends and anyone hurt by this showing up in their feed - I do NOT support any type of antisemitism. And I truly don't tolerate HATE of any kind. Period.\" Foxx, who has been recovering after an undisclosed medical emergency, clarified that his post was directed at a \"fake friend\" who betrayed him. \"That's what I meant by 'they' not anything more,\" he wrote. \"I only have love in my heart for everyone. I love and support the Jewish community. My deepest apologies to anyone who was offended.\" Many people came to Foxx's defense, some saying his post referred to a phrase commonly used by the Black community. \"Any black person growing up in the south will tell you that Jamie Foxx wasn\u2019t referring to Jewish people. 'They killed/lied on/talked about Jesus' simply means 'If Jesus can be betrayed, so can you.' He genuinely meant fake friends/fake people.

But it def got misconstrued in the most oblivious way possible, like was the 'fake friends' hashtag only visible for some folks??\" another tweeted. \"I read Jamie Foxx\u2019s original post and just wondered what fake friends had done him wrong.

        "content": "An Arizona woman is accused of using bleach to poison the coffee of her estranged husband, a member of the Air Force, over several months, according to court documents. Melody Johnson was arrested July 18 after her husband submitted video to police allegedly showing her pouring the toxic substance into his coffee machine, authorities say. The man, who is not named in court documents, started noticing that his coffee tasted badly at the end of March while he was stationed in Germany, court documents say. Johnson and her husband are going through a divorce but lived together with their child. The man continued to drink the coffee for two to three weeks before he used chemical testing strips to test the water in his faucet, which came back normal, according to court documents. When he tested the water in his coffee pot, it showed \"high levels of chlorine,\" the documents say. In May, the man set up a camera in the home, which showed Johnson \"pouring something into his coffee pot,\" according to the complaint, which said he pretended to drink the coffee until the family came back to the U.S. on June 28 because he didn't want to file a report in Germany. While he was temporarily stationed at a hotel on Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Johnson's husband set up another camera, which again showed Johnson \"walk to his coffee maker and pour something into his water reservoir\" on July 5, court documents alleged. The man filed a police report the next day, but officers told him it wasn't clear what Johnson was pouring into his coffee pot, they said. When the family moved to permanent housing on July 7, the man set up more cameras that looked like fire alarms to the ceiling, according to court documents. One was placed in the laundry room, where bleach was kept, another was placed right over the coffee machine, and a third was placed to show walking between the two areas, the documents said. After he collected multiple videos allegedly showing Johnson \"take bleach, pour it into a container and then walk over and pour it into the coffee maker,\" her husband went back to police, court documents say. The man told police he believes his estranged wife was trying to kill him to collect death benefits, police said. Johnson was arrested by Tucson police and charged with attempted first-degree homicide, attempted aggravated assault and adding poison to food or drink. She was being held at the Pima County Adult Detention Center, according to online records. A search with a warrant recovered a container with liquid in it in Johnson's bedroom under her bathroom sink that smelled like bleach, according to court documents, which said liquid inside the coffee maker also smelled like bleach. It wasn't clear whether Johnson has an attorney.",

        "title": "Mississippi cannot strip convicts of right to vote, federal appeals court rules",
        "content": "A divided federal appeals court on Friday ruled that Mississippi cannot strip the right to vote from thousands of convicts after they complete their sentences, calling that a \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d that disproportionately affected Black people. A 2-1 panel of the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals faulted a provision of Mississippi\u2019s state constitution that mandates lifetime disenfranchisement for people convicted of a set of crimes including murder, rape and theft. Siding with a group of convicts who sued in 2018 to regain their right to vote, U.S. Circuit Judge James Dennis wrote that the state\u2019s policy violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishments. He said the state\u2019s constitutional provision, Section 241, served no legitimate purpose, ensures former offenders are never fully rehabilitated, and was adopted in 1890 after the U.S. Civil War to \u201censure the political supremacy of the white race.\u201d The provision, whose list of disqualifying crimes had been amended twice in the years, remained effective in achieving its \u201cracially discriminatory aim,\u201d Dennis said. Of the nearly 29,000 Mississippians convicted of disenfranchising offenses who had completed their sentences from 1994 to 2017, 58% were Black, he said. He said Mississippi was \u201cbucking a clear and consistent trend in our Nation against permanent disenfranchisement,\u201d he said, noting that 35 states plus Washington, D.C., today disavow the practice. Dennis was joined by U.S. Circuit Judge Carolyn Dineen King in reversing a lower-court judge\u2019s ruling. Both are appointees of Democratic presidents on the conservative-leaning court. \u201cThis is a major victory for Mississippians who have completed their sentences and deserve to participate fully in our political process,\u201d said Jonathan Youngwood, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit. A spokesperson for Republican Attorney General Lynn Fitch said she would appeal the decision, as \u201cthe Supreme Court has signaled that felon disenfranchisement is not punishment.\u201d In a dissenting opinion, U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Jones, an appointee of former Republican President Ronald Reagan, noted the U.S. Supreme Court in 1974 held that state laws permanently disenfranchising felons did not violate their equal protection rights under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 4th Amendment. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling disregards text, precedent, and common sense to secure its preferred outcome,\u201d Jones wrote.",

An engine company was dispatched to area of the barn, in northwest Forsyth County, based on a report of smoke in the area, the Forsyth County Fire Department said. As the firefighters were en route, the fire department fielded multiple additional calls confirming fire at the location, it said. The blaze was raging when first responders got there, the fire department said. \"The crew encountered a fully involved large barn containing multiple horse stalls,\" it said. Firefighters assumed a defensive stance until the fire burned the structure to the ground, the fire department said. \"Lost in the fire were 26 horses that were boarded at the facility,\" it said. \"The barn itself is also a total loss.\" The cause of the fire was under investigation.",

        "title": "Italy suggests exit of China's Belt and Road in shift toward U.S.",
        "content": "It has long been a sore spot for the Western alliance: Italy, a key partner of the United States, cozying up to China. But now Rome is trying to back away \u2014 without angering the Asian giant 10 times its economic size \u2014 and Washington will be watching the balancing act closely as it pushes allies to reimagine their own delicate ties with Beijing. The U.S. was deeply critical of Italy's decision in 2019 to become the only major Western economy to sign on to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. The BRI, as it\u2019s known, is an unprecedented global infrastructure project that critics see as Beijing\u2019s attempt to gain influence abroad and make smaller countries financially dependent on Chinese investment. But this week Italy gave its strongest signal yet that it planned to pull out of the project. Signing the deal four years ago was \u201can improvised and atrocious act,\u201d Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told the Corriere della Sera newspaper on Sunday. \u201cWe exported a load of oranges to China, they tripled exports to Italy in three years.\u201d Crosetto added a more measured coda: \u201cThe issue today is, how to walk back without damaging relations? Because it is true that while China is a competitor, it is also a partner.\u201d These remarks followed months of reports that Italy planned to quit the BRI. Giorgia Meloni, Italy\u2019s far-right prime minister, said her government would make a decision by December, when the pact between Rome and Beijing is due to renew. Whichever way Rome goes, it has already become a test case for today\u2019s Western dilemma over China: How to continue tapping into the lucrative Chinese market while restricting certain areas, such as microchips, and holding Beijing to account over human rights \u2014 all without provoking a backlash. Four years ago, Italy\u2019s allies \u201cthought we were selling our soul to the devil\u201d by signing up to the BRI, said Filippo Fasulo, an expert in Italian-Chinese relations at the Italian Institute for International Studies, a think tank based in Milan. Today Italy wants to show it is \u201cclosely aligned with the U.S., Western camp\u201d while keeping a \u201cstable relationship with China,\u201d Fasulo told NBC News. \u201cThe problem is, how to explain that to China?\u201d China\u2019s hawkish Global Times newspaper on Monday derided the Italian defense minister's comments as resulting from \u201cmounting pressure from the U.S. and the E.U.\u201d as well as Italy's right-wing politics. \u201cThe current government is quite pro-U.S.,\u201d Wang Yiwei, a professor at the Center for European Studies at China's Renmin University, said of Italy. \"It's their decision, but we feel regret.\" Asked about the Italian defense minister\u2019s comments, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement Friday that the BRI \u201cunleashed great enthusiasm and potential for bilateral cooperation.\u201d They added that some forces had \u201claunched malicious hype and politicized the cultural exchange and trade cooperation between China and Italy under the Belt and Road framework in a bid to disrupt cooperation and create division.\u201d Indeed this was the future that successive Italian leaders dreamed of before the country signed up. They saw the boom in Chinese goods through Greece\u2019s Port of Piraeus after it was acquired by China\u2019s state-owned shipping giant COSCO in 2016. There was also an alluring historical narrative. The BRI is based loosely on the ancient Silk Road trade route, the same that was traversed by the medieval Venetian explorer Marco Polo. When Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Italy to sign the deal in 2019, he described Polo as a \u201cpioneer of cultural exchanges between East and West\u201d and an inspiration for centuries of friendship since. Though European countries had spoken warmly about the Chinese government in the years previously, by the time Italy inked its deal Western attitudes had begun to turn, with increased scrutiny on China's human rights record and President Donald Trump launching a trade war on Beijing. At the time, however, Italy\u2019s populist leadership \u201cwas a government of inexperienced people,\u201d said Fasulo, the Italy-China expert. \u201cThey did not realize in time that the international scenario was changing so fast.\u201d The outcome \u2014 while not quite \u201ca load of oranges\u201d \u2014 has not been kind to Italy. Since signing the BRI, Chinese exports to Italy have risen 51%, but Italy's exports to China have gone up only 26%, according to Italian government figures. Italy\u2019s decision may not only be economic. Some observers have questioned how Meloni \u2014 accused of anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ policies \u2014 fits with President Joe Biden\u2019s attempts to corral a coalition of democracies against world autocracies. Nevertheless she has made no secret of her desire to be seen by Washington as a reliable partner when it comes to both China and Russia, at a time of swirling questions over the mettle of other powers like France and Germany. To that end she was in Washington last week, touting her credentials as leader of a \"center-right government\" and brushing off \"false propaganda\" about her political leanings, as she told Italy's Sky Tg24, owned by NBC News' parent company Comcast. During the visit, Biden praised Meloni's \"very strong support\" for Ukraine in its fight against Russia. \u201cPart of this is about trying to put bilateral relations with Washington on a sounder footing,\u201d said Francesco Sisci, a senior researcher at the Center for European Studies at China\u2019s Renmin University. \u201cWithdrawing from it now is a signal of a change of heart in the Western approach to China.\u201d",

        "content": "The mother of the teenager who surfaced at a Montana police station nearly four years after disappearing from Arizona is asking the public to \u201cmove on,\u201d warning that questions surrounding her daughter's disappearance have taken a \u201cdangerous\u201d turn. Jessica Nu\u00f1ez made her plea in a video posted on the Facebook page \u201cFinding Alicia\u201d Sunday, thanking the public for their support over the past few years.  \u201cI can\u2019t even put into the words the amount of gratitude I have for you all,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that we know that Alicia is alive, I have to ask one more favor of you. I know you want answers, and I do too. But the public search for answers has taken a turn for the dangerous.\u201d Nu\u00f1ez said she has been harassed and her family has been attacked on the internet. \u201cThe public has gone from trying to help Alicia to doing things like trying to show up to her house and putting her safety in jeopardy,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez explained.  She asked the public to refrain from posting TikToks about her daughter and to stop reaching out to the teen or her family \u201cwith your speculations or questions or assumptions.\u201d   \u201cThis is not a movie, this is our life,\u201d the mother said, stressing she\u2019ll continue to protect her daughter.  \u201cFor this is my statement, there is an ongoing investigation, and I\u2019m begging you to move on,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez concluded. Navarro was 14 years old when she disappeared from the Phoenix area on Sept. 15, 2019. Now 18, she reported to a police station in a small Montana town near the Canadian border recently and identified herself as a missing person.   Nu\u00f1ez told NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d in 2020 that she had found a note in her daughter\u2019s bedroom saying she ran away, which she said was out of character. She added that her daughter was on the autism spectrum and could be shy or anxious in some social situations. Glendale Police spokesman Jose Santiago said at a news conference earlier this month: \u201cShe is by all accounts safe, she is by all accounts healthy, and she is by all accounts happy.\u201d \u201cShe is not in any kind of trouble. She is not facing any kind of charges,\u201d he added. Police Lt. Scott Waite said the case remains under investigation. Police did not immediately have details about how she arrived in Montana. \u201cEvery indication she\u2019s given to us so far is that she willfully left her home,\u201d Waite said. \u201cNow, the dynamics surrounding that decision are obviously something we\u2019re looking into.\u201d Officials said she arrived at the police station by herself. Santiago said she \u201cbasically asked for help to clear her off of a missing juvenile list.\u201d Police shared a videoclip Thursday showing the moment Navarro told authorities no one had hurt her. When police announced Navarro was found, they said she had been reunited with her mother \u201celectronically.\u201d Santiago said: \u201cShe wanted to talk to her mom, and she wanted to make sure her mother knew she was OK.\u201d",

        "content": "A Russian \u201cguided air bomb\u201d hit a blood transfusion center in northeast Ukraine Saturday night, killing two people and injuring four, Ukrainian officials said.  \u201cThis war crime alone says everything about Russian aggression,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in Telegram post, alongside a picture of a building engulfed in flames. He said that a \u201cguided air bomb\u201d had hit the blood transfusion center in the northeastern city of Kupiansk. In a separate post on his own Telegram channel, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said initial reports suggested two men had died and another four were injured in the \u201clarge scale fire.\u201d Houses and farm buildings were also damaged, he said, adding that residential housing and other agricultural buildings had also been struck in nearby villages. NBC News could not independently verify the claims, and Russia has repeatedly denied deliberately targeting civilians in what it calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, although Western leaders and Ukraine\u2019s armed forces estimate thousands of people, both military members and civilians, have been killed and that millions more have been displaced.    The city of Kupiansk and its outlying settlements are in Kharkiv, which were seized by Russian troops in the early days of Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  The area was liberated during a Ukrainian counteroffensive in September but has since come under heavy shelling and attacks.  Elsewhere, the Moscow-appointed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said in a Telegram post that the Chongar Bridge, which links the peninsula to the Russian occupied Ukrainian mainland, had been hit with a \u201cmissile strike.\u201d \u201cOne hit, some of the missiles were shot down by air defense forces,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is damage to the roadbed of the automobile bridge, repair work is already beginning. There are no victims.\u201d Farther north, Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-installed mayor of the city of Donetsk said a fire had broken out at the University of Economics and Trade after 40 missiles were fired in its vicinity. Alexei Kostrubitsky, the Russian-installed Donetsk regional emergency minister, told Reuters that Ukrainian forces had used cluster munitions in the shelling, which had caused the fire. NBC News could not verify these claims, but both sides have used cluster munitions over the course of the invasion.  The intense overnight fighting came as officials from 40 different countries, including the U.S. and China, met in Jeddah to begin Ukraine-organized peace talks seeking to find a way to start negotiations over Russia\u2019s war on the country. Ukrainian and Western diplomats hope that the senior officials from countries across both the global North and South will agree on key principles for a future peace settlement to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Russia was not invited. The renewed global push to peace comes as Russia exited a Turkey and U.N.-backed deal in July allowing for the safe export of Ukrainian grain, causing a jump in global food prices.",

        "title": "Green backlash? U.K.\u2019s leader fuels battle over driving \u2014 which could signal a coming climate fight",
        "content": "LONDON \u2014 Posing in a car once owned by conservative icon Margaret Thatcher, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak explained why he was launching a media blitz to burnish his own credentials as a champion of the average voter against what he considers state overreach in the name of the environment. Signaling his opposition to a slate of environmentally-friendly policies, Sunak said on Twitter Sunday that he knows \u201chow important cars are for families to live their lives,\u201d unlike the country\u2019s \u201canti-motorist\u201d opposition Labour Party. Sunak\u2019s embattled Conservative government subsequently announced a review of \u201canti-car\u201d measures aimed at improving air quality and reducing traffic, as well as a massive expansion of oil and gas drilling licenses in Britain\u2019s North Sea. The prime minister claims the U.K. can do all this and still reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But it was a sudden turn in a nation where there has largely been a political consensus over green politics \u2014 and experts told NBC News it may be only the beginning of a broader shift in which right-wing parties view opposition to green policies as an opportunity to win votes. Bolstered by a surprise local election victory last month in which the Conservative Party emphasized its opposition to new charges for drivers in London, Sunak has wooed voters by embracing a protest movement that sees such attempts to restrict car usage as an attack on personal freedoms. The move comes as several European countries face political turmoil over environmental issues. The Netherlands saw the Farmer-Citizen Movement become a leading political party this year, thanks to its fierce opposition to government plans to reduce or shut thousands of farms, while Poland\u2019s right-wing populist government has criticized the European Union\u2019s renewable energy targets, which commit its 27 member states to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030.  \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is once again, as with immigration, a center-right party beginning to take on some of the typical tropes and rhetoric of radical right-wing populist parties, who present themselves very often as the friend of the motorist and say all these environmental concerns are overblown,\u201d said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University in London and an expert on the Conservative Party. On July 21 the Conservatives unexpectedly won a by-election in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, the parliamentary seat in London\u2019s western suburbs that was vacated by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The election became a referendum on ULEZ, the ultra-low emission zone, which charges drivers of older, high-polluting vehicles 12.50 pounds ($16) a day to drive in London\u2019s central boroughs. At the end of August the zone will extend across Greater London \u2014 and suburban residents\u2019 concerns over this gave the Conservatives a much-needed victory.  Some protesters opposing the change are heavily influenced by elaborate right-wing conspiracy theories, and such is the level of disquiet, cameras installed to enforce the scheme have been vandalized or stolen.   London\u2019s mayor, Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan, has nevertheless passionately defended the policy and said it was needed because thousands of people in the capital die each year from air pollution.  The vast majority of cars also won\u2019t pay any emissions charge. But the Uxbridge result sparked wavering on ULEZ from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, eager to avoid any potential wedge issues that could help the Conservatives keep power.  And Sunak\u2019s media blitz comes as many Conservative lawmakers and party members believe environmental policies will cost Britain too much and have only a limited effect, said Bale. \u201cUxbridge has accelerated or amplified those voices and probably, given the government\u2019s in so much trouble on all sorts of other fronts, encouraged the government to weaponize the issue in the hope of mobilizing some of its base,\u201d he said. The Uxbridge win defied political gravity, however.  The Conservatives were soundly beaten in two other by-elections the same day, with Labour taking the seat of Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire, a dramatic and unprecedented reversal from 2019, when a Conservative lawmaker triumphed by 20,000 votes. There could be more to come: Labour leads by about 20% with a year to go until a national election, according to opinion polls.  With an ongoing cost of living crisis dominating voters\u2019 thoughts and most areas of the country untouched by the planned emission zones or similar low-traffic schemes, some analysts have questioned the wisdom of Sunak\u2019s strategy. An opinion poll in May found that 39% of Londoners were in favor of ULEZ, with 35% opposed. Many lawmakers in rural seats backed the prime minister\u2019s stance, though Conservative former Energy Minister Chris Skidmore said the North Sea drilling expansion put Sunak \u201con the wrong side of history.\u201d Protesters from the campaign group Greenpeace took direct action in response to the new North Sea licenses and draped an oil-black covering over Sunak\u2019s home in his North Yorkshire Constituency on Thursday while the family was on holiday in California.  A determination to appeal to a perceived median voter, often seen as a driver, is nothing new in British politics. But this debate \u2014 a perceived trade-off between personal liberty and environmental policy \u2014 is a sign of things to come in politics, according to Neil Lee, a professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics. \u201cI think that environmental policy will rise higher up the agenda as climate change and other environmental impacts become more obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first of these debates where small groups can hold back moves, which I think in our hearts we know we have to make.",

        "content": "The World Scout Jamboree in South Korea faced calls to be canceled on Saturday after large contingents from the United States and Britain pulled out a week early over extreme heat and weather conditions. Saturday\u2019s pullout by the U.S., as well as Singapore, is a fresh blow to the organizers and the South Korean government, which on Friday promised more water trucks, air-conditioned spaces and medics in an attempt to save the event. Temperatures have hit 93 degrees Farhenheit in Saemangeum, near the city of Buan on South Korea\u2019s west coast, where 39,000 participants, mostly scouts aged 14-18, were camping as of Friday. Kristin Sayers from the U.S. state of Virginia said her 17-year-old son Corey\u2019s dream to take part in the jamboree, at a cost of $6,500, had turned into a \u201cnightmare\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s very aware of how much money that is and the sacrifices we made as a family to send him. We could\u2019ve done so much with that money,\u201d she told Reuters by video link. In an effort to calm the situation, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol ordered officials to roll out tour programmes showcasing Korean culture and nature in Seoul and other cities, available for all scouts. Some countries, including the Philippines and Argentina, have said they would remain at the campsite despite challenges from extreme weather. \u201cWe are seeing around the site some improvements,\u201d Marina Rustan, president of Argentina Scout Association, told a press conference. \u201cWe had the word of the leadership of the government that things will be improved.\u201d The U.S. contingent will take part in a jamboree program on Saturday before moving to U.S. Army Garrison Humphreys near the jamboree site on Sunday, according to an email reviewed by Reuters. \u201cThe US Contingent to the World Scout Jamboree has made the difficult decision that we will be departing the 25th World Scout Jamboree site early because of ongoing extreme weather and resulting conditions at the jamboree site,\u201d said the email sent to parents by the U.S. group\u2019s media team. Britain, the largest grouping at the jamboree, said on Friday they were moving to hotels in Seoul for the rest of their stay, to alleviate pressure on the site. British scouts were seen leaving the campsite with their bags in Buan on Saturday morning. The World Organization of the Scout Movement said in a statement on Friday it had asked the Korean Scout Association to consider \u201calternative options to end the event earlier than scheduled and support the participants until they depart for their home countries.\u201d Organizers would meet on Saturday to discuss whether to continue, cancel or scale back the event, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency reported. Hit by extreme heat, hundreds of participants at the event fell ill and were treated for heat-related ailments, prompting complaints from parents over the safety of their children. More than 150 countries were taking part in the gathering as of Friday, according to officials. The jamboree is scheduled to run until Aug. 12.",

        "content": "The husband of a Georgia mother-of-four who had been missing for more than two weeks was arrested after deputies found her body, the Rockdale County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Saturday. Donell Anderson was taken into custody Friday night in connection with the disappearance and death of Imani Roberson. She was last seen July 16 in Conyers after leaving her mother's house. Her vehicle was later found torched and in pieces in the Atlanta area, about 24 miles away. Images provided by her family to NBC News affiliate WXIA in Atlanta appeared to show charred pieces of her vehicle still littering the site where it was found. And video from a neighbor\u2019s doorbell camera, also provided by her family to WXIA, appeared to show the vehicle pulling out of Roberson\u2019s driveway the evening she went missing. Anderson was arrested at an apartment in Atlanta and charged with felony murder, malice murder, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm, Sheriff Eric Levett said at a news conference. He said there will be more arrests. \"This investigation is still ongoing and I can assure you that another arrest will be made,\" the sheriff told reporters. On the day Roberson went missing, she and her four children had visited her mother for a family dinner. Roberson and two of her children, ages 3 and 1 month, had left to go back home, her family and authorities said. The other two children, 11 and 9, stayed at the grandmother\u2019s house, according to the sheriff. The following day, Roberson's mother, Clarine Andujar-White, called her daughter repeatedly but she did not answer. She went by the home and found no one there, authorities said. Andujar-White filed a missing person\u2019s report on July 17. All four children are safe, authorities said. Andujar-White said it has been a \"very difficult day\" for the family. \"When I couldn\u2019t reach Imani almost three weeks ago, I knew something was wrong,\" she said. \"Late last night my worst fears were confirmed and our family is devastated.\" Roberson's father,  Ronald Acklin, said \"this is not the news we wanted to have.\" \"I said my goodbyes to my daughter yesterday,\" he said through tears. The sheriff's office is still asking anyone with information to come forward. \"Put yourself in the shoes of this family. Put yourself in the shoes of this mother and father who not only just lost a daughter, they lost a daughter that has four children that's young as 1 month old,\" the sheriff said. \"If you have a heart and you know something ... you would call and give us information.\"",

        "title": "Skipper of boat in Italy crash that killed U.S. publishing executive faces manslaughter investigation",
        "content": "ROME \u2014 The skipper of a rented motorboat involved in a crash off the Amalfi Coast that killed a U.S. publishing executive is being investigated on suspicion of manslaughter, a prosecutor in southern Italy said Saturday. Salerno Chief Prosecutor Giuseppe Borrelli said at a news conference in the port city that the skipper, an Italian who hasn\u2019t been publicly identified, is also being investigated on suspicion of causing a shipwreck. No charges have been filed, and the investigation continues. Adrienne Vaughan, 45, was killed and her husband and the skipper of the rented motorboat were injured in the accident Thursday afternoon off a stretch of coastline popular with tourists. The motorboat slammed into a chartered sailboat, on which 70 guests were enjoying a wedding reception. Vaughan was the president of Bloomsbury Publishing\u2019s U.S. branch, which counts writers from bestselling novelists Sarah J. Maas and Susanna Clarke to historian Mark Kurlansky among its roster of authors. Blood samples were taken from the skipper to determine alcohol and drug levels. Borrelli indicated that for now the results were inconclusive. \u201cThe results are being evaluated by a consultant of the prosecutor\u2019s office since the data per se aren\u2019t necessarily significant,\u201d Borrelli said. He added that more evaluation was needed to determine \u201cthe incidence of the levels on the ability of the subject\u201d to pilot the boat. Italian news reports said Friday that the blood toxicology tests had found traces of cocaine. Investigators have questioned the skipper, who remains hospitalized with what Italian media said are pelvis and rib fractures. The victim\u2019s husband, Mike White, is being treated at another hospital for a shoulder injury, according to reports. Authorities have spoken to him and plan to do so again, Borrelli said. The couple\u2019s two young children were uninjured. They\u2019re in the care of one of their grandfathers, who traveled to Italy to help while their father is convalescing, the prosecutor said. Borrelli said that when the crash happened, Vaughan was sunning herself on the bow and \u201cbounced\u201d into the water at the moment of impact. He declined to detail her injuries, saying the results of an autopsy are pending. Two doctors who were among the passengers on the sailboat dived into the sea to help Vaughan, while a nearby vessel took her to shore, Italian state radio said, quoting the sailboat\u2019s captain. Borrelli said the woman died before a medical helicopter and a local ambulance could take her to hospital. The sailboat\u2019s captain has told Italian media that the motorboat was speeding when it smashed into the stationary sailboat\u2019s bow. The prosecutor said investigators also questioned the captain of the sailboat, as well as 70 passengers, including U.S. and other foreign tourists. The motorboat had set sail from the town of Amalfi, Borrelli said. According to Italian media, the family was headed to Positano, another popular coastal town. A Bloomsbury book, \u201cChasing Me to My Grave: An Artist\u2019s Memoir of the Jim Crow South,\u201d by the late Winfred Rembert (as told to Erin I. Kelly), won the Pulitzer Prize for biography last year. Bloomsbury\u2019s CEO, Nigel Newton, called Vaughan\u2019s death \u201ca terrible blow\u201d in a statement. \u201cAdrienne was a natural business leader with a great future ahead of her. She was deeply loved by colleagues due to her combination of great personal warmth with a fierce determination to make the business succeed and grow,\u201d Newton added. \u201cHer business instincts were outstanding and she loved authors, readers and her colleagues equally.\u201d A statement from the Association of American Publishers, where Vaughan was a board member, called her a \"leader of dazzling talent and infectious passion\" and \"an extraordinary human being.\" \"We send our love and condolences to all those who are in shock and mourning at this tragic loss, most particularly her husband and two children, whom she spoke of frequently with great pride,\" it said. Before she worked for Bloomsbury, Vaughan worked for other publishers, including Scholastic, Disney Publishing Worldwide and Oxford University Press, according to the statement.",

        "content": "LONDONDERRY, N.H. \u2014 The events of Jan. 6 took center stage Friday at Mike Pence\u2019s first campaign event after his former running mate pleaded not guilty to charges that he engaged in criminal conspiracies aimed at overturning the 2020 presidential election. As soon as the former vice president arrived at the American Legion Hall in Londonderry, New Hampshire, he encountered about 10 pro-Trump protesters carrying flags and signs. \u201cThere\u2019s the sellout! There\u2019s the traitor!\u201d they yelled at Pence as he exited his vehicle. \u201cWhy\u2019d you sell out the people?\u201d There was no violence, and Pence did not engage with the supporters of his rival for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. At the town hall, Pence tried to court the protesters. \u201cI know the people in this movement, whether they support me or not, are the best people in this country,\u201d he said as he pointed to the protesters in the corner of the room. In response to a question about the potential for further violence from Trump supporters in the wake of Jan. 6, Pence said he rejected that notion \u201ccategorically.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you there is a lot of passion out there, but I just, I reject your suggestion that that passion is translated into the violence and vandalism of that day,\u201d he said. Pence's role on Jan. 6, when some rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence,\" has been thrust back into the spotlight following Tuesday's indictment of former President Donald Trump. In that document, federal prosecutors said Pence kept \u201ccontemporaneous notes\u201d about meetings and conversations he had with Trump leading up to Jan 6. The indictment also said that the president and a co-conspirator now known to be lawyer John Eastman asked Pence to use his authority as president of the Senate on Jan. 6 to either reject certain states\u2019 electors or send them back to their state legislatures. On Friday night, one town hall participant, Mary Bartel of Windham, asked Pence why he didn't go along with that plan. Pence explained, as he has previously to other skeptical voters, that he did not have the authority to overturn the election. He also told her to write down and look up \u201cArticle Two, Section One, Clause Three\u201d of the Constitution. \u201cI will,\u201d she said.",

        "title": "Vivek Ramaswamy calls Juneteenth 'useless' 2 months after posting a video celebrating it",
        "content": "VAIL, Iowa \u2014 Vivek Ramaswamy suggested canceling Juneteenth, calling it a \u201cuseless\u201d holiday in a conversation with Iowa voters Saturday.  Less than two months ago, however, he posted a video on social media celebrating the day.  Breaking down his plan Saturday to institute a national voting holiday, Ramaswamy, a GOP presidential candidate, proposed making space for the new holiday by canceling an old one.  \u201cCancel Juneteenth or one of the other useless ones we made up,\u201d Ramaswamy told an applauding crowd gathered at a welding company here. Asked by NBC News to clarify whether he thought Juneteenth was a \u201cuseless\u201d holiday, Ramaswamy said, \u201cI basically do.\u201d  Less than two months ago, on Juneteenth itself, he spoke differently about the celebration.  \u201cWe don\u2019t just look back and flog ourselves,\u201d Ramaswamy said in the video June 19, which was posted to his account on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.   \u201cWhat we celebrate is how far we\u2019ve come. And as a first-generation American myself, you better believe I\u2019m proud of it. Happy Juneteenth everybody,\u201d he said.  When NBC News asked Ramaswamy on Saturday whether he believed Veterans Day or Memorial Day were also useless holidays, he said he didn\u2019t.  \u201cI stand with the presumption of time-tested traditions,\u201d he said.   While Juneteenth became a federal holiday only in 2021, it has been observed since 1866. In 2004, President George W. Bush issued a statement commemorating the holiday. On Saturday, Ramaswamy called the Juneteenth holiday \u201credundant,\u201d saying it overlapped with other holidays, like Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Presidents Day. Yet Juneteenth celebrates something completely different. As the National Museum of African American History and Culture notes, Juneteenth celebrates the anniversary of when Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, and announced a quarter-million Black people had been freed by executive decree.   \u201cThe reason for making it a holiday was under political duress. It was a political hostage situation on the back of the death of George Floyd,\u201d Ramaswamy said.  One of his competitors, former Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, who is biracial, criticized Ramaswamy for saying he \"hopes to cancel a holiday that celebrates equality and freedom.\" \"His gimmicks and shtick aren\u2019t serious,\" Hurd said. On Juneteenth two months ago, the NAACP issued a statement saying, \u201cToday we celebrate our emancipation while also acknowledging that we are still fighting for true freedom.\u201d  ",

        "title": "The heaviest animal ever? Ancient whale found in Peru desert",
        "content": "A giant whale that lived almost 40 million years ago is now thought to be the heaviest animal that has ever lived, scientists said Wednesday. The Perucetus colossus \u2014 meaning the colossal whale from Peru \u2014was even bigger than the current heavyweight champion, the blue whale, according to an article published in the journal \u201cNature.\u201d The newly revealed findings were based on fossils found in the Peruvian desert more than 10 years ago, but only just identified as a previously unknown species. At 66 feet in length, the colossus isn\u2019t the biggest or longest creature to have lived in the seas, since blue whales can grow to a gargantuan 100 feet long. But the newly discovered sea mammal\u2019s sheer bulk and its bone density means it was probably the heaviest and could have weighed between 94 tons (85 metric tons) and 375 tons (340 metric tons), the study said. The biggest blue whales ever observed weigh an estimated 200 tons (180 metric tons). \u201cThe estimated skeletal mass of P. colossus exceeds that of any known mammal or aquatic vertebrate,\u201d the journal article said, adding that this makes it \u201ca contender for the title of heaviest animal on record.\u201d \u201cThe body mass of this ancient cetacean may have been ... almost twice that of the largest blue whales and more than three times that estimated for Argentinosaurus, one of the largest dinosaurs ever found,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Giovanni Bianucci, from the University of Pisa in Italy, in a press release. An international team of scientists spent years digging in the Ica desert along the southern coast of Peru, an area that was once underwater and is famed for its paleontological discoveries. Eventually they uncovered and extracted 13 vertebrae, four ribs and a hip bone. Each vertebrae would have weighed more than 220 pounds. This posed quite a challenge for the research team, who struggled not only to lift the bone fossils but to fully analyze them via the usual methods. Instead they used pioneering structured light scanning to make a three-dimensional model of them and drilled inside. This allowed them to estimate the whale's size and weight despite having an incomplete skeleton. Dating of volcanic ash at the site means the team could date the species to between 39.8 and 37.84 million years ago, in the Eocene epoch. At that point other members of the cetacean family \u2014 which includes dolphins and whales \u2014 were still \u201cabandoning the terrestrial lifestyle in favor of a marine one,\u201d said Elisa Malinverno, a member of the research team. The Perucetus colossus may have used its heavy skeleton as a ballast to roam around the ocean floor, feeding along the seabed like modern-day sea cows and some sharks, the study said. \u201cIt\u2019s just exciting to see such a giant animal that\u2019s so different from anything we know,\u201d said Hans Thewissen, a paleontologist at Northeast Ohio Medical University who had no role in the research, according to the Associated Press. The Ica desert, one of the driest places on Earth, is also where scientists found the oldest known four-legged cetacean to reach the Pacific Ocean and the earliest ancestor of the modern baleen whales.",

        "content": "One of Italy's most dangerous fugitives has been caught in Greece after a photo of him cheering on his football team gave away his whereabouts. Vincenzo La Porta, 60, is thought to have close ties to the Camorra organised crime gang in Naples. He has been on the run for 11 years - but earlier this year was spotted in a photo of fans celebrating in Greece. The Naples Carabinieri police said: \"What betrayed him was his passion for football and for the Napoli.\" Officers said the photos were taken after Napoli won its first Italian championship in over three decades earlier this year. \"With the championship victory, La Porta couldn't resist celebrating,\" police said. La Porta has already been convicted in absentia in Italy for criminal association, tax evasion and fraud. Police finally arrested him on Friday while he was riding his moped on the Greek island of Corfu and he is now currently in a jail awaiting extradition to Italy. If he is extradited to Italy, he is due serve a prison sentence of 14 years and four months. La Porta's lawyer told AP news agency: \"He has started a new family in Greece... He has a nine-year-old boy and is working as a cook to get by. He suffers from heart ailments. If he's extradited, he and his family will be ruined.\" The authorities were relentless in their pursuit of La Porta, tracking his financial and online movements closely and \"waited for him to make a misstep\". Back in May, La Porta could not contain his excitement when Napoli won its first Serie A title after 33 years. The police spotted him in a photo outside a Corfu restaurant among Napoli fans donning a baseball cap and waving the team's sky blue and white colours. The investigators knew they had their man and followed him to Greece. With a little help from their Greek colleagues, they arrested him on Friday, the Greek police said. In January, this year, an Italian mafia boss who was on the run for decades was arrested after a Google Maps sighting.",

        "title": "Families in Turkey's quake cities battle dust and rubble six months on",
        "content": "Hulya Yesiloglu gazes just beyond her temporary tent city towards a cemetery and says she often wonders if she would have been better off ending up there rather than surviving Turkey's twin earthquakes. She stands at the mouth of a wood-burning oven baking flatbread on a sweltering summer day in the southern city of Antakya. Her old stone oven, where she has turned dough to bread for as long as she can remember, is the only part of her home that survived the earthquakes. The ancient city in Hatay province, 20km (12 miles) from the Syrian border, is still in a dangerous state of disrepair six months after it was ravaged by the February quakes. Even now thousands of people are living here in makeshift tents and container camps. Like ghosts, buildings stripped of their facades still lean over now-vacant lots where houses and businesses once stood. Dust covers every surface as the soundtrack of steel claws digging into piles of crumbled concrete and tangled metal plays unendingly in the background of everyday life. The Turkish government now estimates the cost to rebuild in the 11 provinces affected by the earthquakes will total $105bn (\u00a382bn). But in Antakya, reconstruction isn't even a thought yet, since it's still in the throes of clearing away the rubble. Time has moved on, but progress with rebuilding has been slow, and people who remain, like Hulya, say they feel forgotten. \"Thank God nothing happened to my children, my husband, my loved ones, or my family, but being forgotten, not cared for, and being abandoned are very difficult things,\" she says. A few metres from where Hulya is baking her bread, her family's five-storey apartment building is still standing - but only barely. It was heavily damaged and is due for demolition. She and her husband, Metin, still live in the neighbourhood, but it is now reduced to rubble and buildings that have been shaken open by the earthquake, revealing endless rows of empty rooms inside. The couple's plastic tents are pitched just outside their old front door, but it's too hot to do anything but sleep in them at night and no-one is able to move beyond the disaster. \"Bodies are still being found. It's not over,\" says Hulya. \"If things continue like this, it will only get better after 20 years.\" Her assessment of the time needed to reconstruct this city is a far cry from the one-year deadline set for the region by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan days after the disaster. That's largely because the destruction across Hatay province was immense. More than 50,000 people died in Turkey in the 6 February disaster. In Hatay alone, some 23,000 people died and more than 30,000 were injured, according to Turkey's disaster management agency, Afad. The following month, the Turkish government assessed that no-one should remain in short-term shelters for more than six months. By July, 164,000 people were still living in tents and containers, according to Afad, in an assessment by the UN. \"We have solved some issues, however, there are still challenges,\" says Huseyin Yayman, a member of President Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP), and a representative of Hatay in parliament. \"Water is not available in the city and we are working to fix that,\" he adds. Mr Yayman believes that the rehabilitation process will take much longer than initially anticipated, too, and that financial help is vital - both national and international. \"It takes time to return to normal. I say two plus two: in two years, we can meet the basic needs of people. In two more years, we can start getting back to the new normal,\" he says. \"We want people from other regions of the country and around the world to help us in these areas because we need serious help. We have problems and we would be happy for them to assist.\" Mr Yayman admits that the distribution of aid has been somewhat uneven. In some tent cities further north in the province, the biggest concern is access to air conditioning, which helps to make the summer heat and humidity more bearable. But in the city centre where Hulya Yesiloglu's family lives, the priority is on safe drinking water. Hulya says she and her husband have run out of purified drinking water and are now relying on well water to cook and consume. \"Turkey has faced a huge test in this regard,\" Mr Yayman says. Permanent housing is at the top of the list for many in the region. About 80km (50 miles) north of the centre of Antakya, in the mountainous city of Hassa, new apartment blocks are rising up. The Turkish government has allocated about $370m (\u00a3290m) to the project, which is being built by an organisation within the environment ministry called Toki. Unlike so many of the buildings in Hatay province, Toki insists none of its structures collapsed in February's quake. This development will have 4,000 flats for 30,000 people and feature a school, health centre and a playground. Nurtac Y\u0131lmaz, whose construction company Y\u0131lkanur Insaat is building part of it, says the development won't be fully finished until next summer. \"Just because these constructions are done quickly doesn't mean they are unsafe or not earthquake-resistant,\" he says. When it is ready, this complex will be welcome news for the people of Hassa. Priority, Mr Yilmaz says, is being given to those whose homes were classified as heavily damaged. For others, like the Yesiloglu family, whose homes have been assessed as slightly damaged, it will be a longer road back to normality. \"If the government helps, we don't necessarily have to make [the new house] perfect. You can start slowly, just lay the foundation,\" says Metin Yesiloglu. \"Then, we can slowly finish it. We won't be in such distress. But now, they say they will conduct an analysis. They will tear down this building and analyse the soil here. If it's suitable, they'll allow construction. If it's not, then no, it won't happen.\"",

        "title": "Donald Trump says he will ask the Judge to step aside",
        "content": "Donald Trump has said he will ask the judge in his alleged election fraud case to step aside on what he called \"very powerful grounds\". He claimed that \"there is no way I can get a fair trial\" unless he has a different judge. His call came after the prosecution requested a court order that would limit what he can publicly say about the case. The judge, Tanya Chutkan, was appointed by former President Barack Obama. Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Sunday morning, describing the case as \"the ridiculous freedom of speech/fair elections case\" and saying that his legal team would immediately be asking for recusal of the judge. He gave no details of his grounds for asking her to step down. Judge Chutkan, appointed in 2014, previously ruled against Mr Trump's efforts to shield evidence from the House January 6 Committee. She is also the only federal judge in Washington who has delivered sentences against defendants in cases related to the 6 January Capitol riot that are longer than the sentences that the DOJ asked for, according to NBC News. Under US federal law, any judge of the United States must disqualify themselves in any proceeding in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Recusal of the judge was not the only thing Mr Trump said he would request. He also said he wanted a \"venue change\" and for his case to be moved out of Washington. He previously said there would be \"no way I can get a fair trial, or even close to a fair trial, in Washington\", which he describes as \"anti-Trump\", and has previously described the Department of Justice as \"highly partisan and very corrupt\". Mr Trump's lawyer, John Lauro, said on Sunday that the former president \"believed in his heart of hearts\" that he had won the 2020 election - and that prosecutors will not be able to prove that Mr Trump did not believe this. Speaking to US TV networks, Mr Lauro said Mr Trump was being attacked for exercising his constitutional First Amendment right to free speech. Earlier this week, Mr Trump wrote in capital letters, \"If you go after me, I am coming after you!\" on Truth Social, just a day after he pleaded not guilty to four charges in the alleged election fraud case. And the same night, the prosecutors said they feared there was a chance Mr Trump might disclose confidential evidence and asked for a protective order to prevent \"the improper dissemination or use of discovery materials, including to the public\". Judge Tanya Chutkan gave Mr Trump's legal team until 17:00 local time on Monday to respond to the submission. Mr Trump's lawyers asked for three more days, but the judge denied their request. Judge Chutkan, a noted hardliner on cases against those accused of participation in the Capitol riots, is expected to call in attorneys from both sides on 28 August to discuss setting a trial date. The charges - which include conspiracy to defraud the US, tampering with a witness and conspiracy against the rights of citizens - stem from the former president's actions in the wake of the 2020 election, including around the 6 January Capitol riot. Over the past two years, the 61-year-old judge has won a reputation for harsh sentences for those convicted of participation in the riots. Of the 31 defendants who have come before her, Judge Chutkan has sentenced every one of them to at least some jail time, according to a Washington Post tally. Mr Trump now faces five upcoming trials - three criminal trials which include the classified documents case, the hush money case, and these election charges; and two civil trials over business practices and alleged defamation of a woman who accused him of rape.",

        "title": "'We can't win forever': Fans react as US World Cup reign ends",
        "content": "\"Frankly we're confused,\" one stunned USA fan told me as I turned to her after the final whistle. She was wearing red, blue and white with stars and stripes from head to toe - at that moment she and probably thousands of others were dumbfounded by what just happened. On the big screen in front of us, the Swedish team were jumping and running across the pitch in absolute joy. Meanwhile, the USA squad and their fans in the Melbourne stadium - and in the Sydney fan zone where I was - were trying to understand. It wasn't just that they were eliminated - it was how they were eliminated that added insult (and confusion) to injury. It came down to penalties. It was neck-and-neck until the last penalty kick by Sweden, which crossed the line by the smallest of margins to deliver one of the biggest stories in a Women's World Cup that has been defined by its upsets and its unpredictability. You can't overstate the enormity of this for the US side and the fans. This is a team that has dominated the women's game internationally for years - an achievement that has earned them a fearsome aura. The reigning champions had come to this World Cup to defend this title but have barely scraped through the group stages and have been knocked out before the quarter finals. What's painfully ironic is that this is the best game they played in the tournament so far. \"It was a lot more fun to watch them today than it was to watch at any of the group stages games,\" Anne Tobin told me. Throughout the match, the US side was dominant. They kept pressing and looked threatening - and yet their performance did not translate to goals. Sweden's defence and their goalkeeper Ze\u0107ira Mu\u0161ovi\u0107, who was named Player of the Match and made some of the best saves in this tournament, were in the way. The disappointment was palpable. Some fans had their hands on their heads, others were in tears, and even those who kept smiling acknowledged the sting of the defeat. \"We can't win forever,\" Erin O'Leary told me. \"This was a hard-fought game. I really think we did a lot better than the group stages,\" she added. But this really hurts for the US. It wasn't just the fans. Many of the players were in tears - including veterans Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, who missed her penalty kick in the shootout. It was a painful note for her to end on in her last ever World Cup. But the team has been unconvincing from the beginning of the tournament. There are several reasons why this will go down as one of their worst World Cups to date: The absence of key players due to injury and the generational differences within the squad made the team feel at times very incoherent and messy. Most crucially, this is a tougher terrain now. Teams have become more competitive and less intimidated by big teams. \"Germany is out. Brazil is out,\" Ms O'Leary said of the two power houses which were also eliminated. There will be many questions asked about the future of this team, including how they move on from this, how they start rebuilding, and whether the head coach, Vlatko Andonovski, should stay on. The former champions and their fans will have to come to terms with the fact that their World Cup dominance and their formidable reign have come to an end - at least for now.",

        "content": "Israeli security forces say they have killed three alleged Palestinian militants in the north of the occupied West Bank, near the Jenin refugee camp. The camp was the focus of a major military operation last month. It marks a further escalation in a wave of violence over the weekend. On Friday, armed Jewish settlers attacked a Palestinian village where a young Palestinian man was shot dead, while an Israeli security guard was killed in an attack in Tel Aviv. In a statement, the army said the group was heading to carry out an attack and that an automatic rifle was found in their car. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the security forces, saying: \"We will continue to take action - everywhere and at any moment - against those who seek to attack us.\" The killings came the day after a Palestinian gunman fatally shot an Israeli security guard in Tel Aviv. Another guard shot and killed the attacker. After the killing of three Palestinians on Sunday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said: \"These horrific crimes in Jenin would not have taken place had the perpetrators not felt safe from punishment.\" Palestinian armed groups condemned the killings, vowing for revenge. \"The enemy, which assassinated three of our Palestinian people, will not escape paying the price of its crimes,\" said a spokesperson for Hamas who rules Gaza. The Islamic Jihad, which has members in Gaza and the West Bank, said: \"The enemy will realise that its foolishness and terrorism will be met by a strong response from the resistance.\" On Friday night, extremist settlers went on the rampage in a Palestinian village in the West Bank, killing a 19-year-old man. Israeli police say two settlers have been arrested. The latest settler attack has been condemned as terrorism by Washington, its stronger language appearing to show increased frustration with the positions of Israel's far-right government.",

The leather and mink garment, worn by Elvis Presley during the last year of his life, went under the hammer at Henry Aldridge & Son auctions in Devizes, Wiltshire on Saturday. It was purchased for \u00a3128,000 by a US collector. Auctioneer Henry Aldridge had previously said they expected the coat to reach around \u00a315,000. Elvis Presley gave the garment, which is 120cm (4ft) in length, to the brother of his fianc\u00e9e Ginger Alden before his death in 1977. The lot was accompanied by a letter of authenticity from Rosemary Alden Starkey, who is Ginger Alden's sister. Auctioneer Henry Aldridge had previously said they acquired the coat from a client who had bought the garment during an annual Elvis Presley auction held at the singer's former home at Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: \"For me it encapsulates the glamour of 1970s Vegas, Elvis in a mink coat.\" A gold-owl shaped ring, also owned by Elvis Presley, sold for \u00a314,000.

        "title": "Porton Down: Can this laboratory help stop the next pandemic?",
        "content": "One of the UK's most secretive centres of scientific research - Porton Down - is aiming to stop the next pandemic \"in its tracks\". I have passed through the incredibly tight security at this remote facility to get rare access to its scientists. They are based in the shiny new Vaccine Development and Evaluation Centre. Their work builds on the response to Covid, and aims to save lives and minimise the need for lockdowns when a new disease next emerges. \"Covid, of course, is not a one-off,\" says Prof Dame Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which runs these laboratories. \"We say it [Covid] was the biggest public health incident for a century, but I don't think any of us think it'll be a century before the next,\" she adds. The combination of climate change, urbanisation and people living closer to animals - the source of many new diseases which transfer to people - means we're facing a \"rising tide of risk\", she says. Porton Down - located in the tranquil Wiltshire countryside, near Salisbury - is one of the few places in the world equipped to research some of the nastiest viruses and bacteria you could imagine. The freezers here contain the likes of Ebola. Neighbouring buildings include the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (part of the Ministry of Defence), where it was confirmed the nerve agent Novichok has been used in the Salisbury poisonings. The vaccine laboratories - housed in dark green buildings - were hastily constructed as part of the emergency response to Covid. But, as the intense demands of the pandemic have waned, the focus has shifted. The new vaccine research centre is concentrating on three types of threat: The aim is to work with the pharmaceutical industry, scientists and doctors to support all stages of vaccine development. Porton Down scientists are working on the first vaccine against Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever, which is spread by ticks and kills around a third of those infected. The disease is found in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and in Asia - and could spread further with climate change. At the other end of the process, vaccine effectiveness is evaluated. It was scientists here who spotted that the Omicron variant could bypass some of the protection afforded by Covid vaccines. And they are still monitoring new Covid variants by growing them in the laboratory, exposing them to antibodies in taken from blood samples and seeing if new variants are still able to infect. Meanwhile machines - unofficially named Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, BB8 and Palpatine - are part of the front line monitoring the threat posed by the world's largest flu outbreak in birds. The H5N1 avian flu virus has devastated bird populations, and routine testing of farmworkers has found the first, symptomless, cases in people in the UK. The difference is, before the pandemic the teams here were able to test just 100 samples a week - now it's more than 3,000. The work here feeds into the \"100 Days Mission\" - a hugely ambitious vision to develop a vaccine against a new threat in 100 days. Historically, it has taken a decade to design and test new vaccines. The unique circumstances of the pandemic meant the first Covid vaccines were produced within a year, with the vaccine rollout starting in December 2020. Estimates suggest Covid vaccines saved more than 14 million lives in just the first 12 months they were used. \"Imagine if those vaccines had been available just a bit earlier,\" said Prof Isabel Oliver, chief scientific officer for UKHSA. \"They were available more rapidly than ever before in history, [but] we could have saved many more lives and we could have returned to greater normality much more quickly.\" The hope here is the lessons of the Covid pandemic will be mean we are better prepared next time. Prof Harries says in the past we have been simply reacting to events, but in the future we need to be on the front foot and \"try and stop\" any pandemic before it even begins. And if a new disease does occur, she adds, we need to \"stop it in its tracks\" in its earliest stage. Follow Jameson Twitter Photos: Emma Lynch/BBC",

        "title": "BBC Africa Eye: Elderly caned at Kenya's PCEA Thogoto Care Home for the Aged",
        "content": "Vulnerable residents at an elderly care home near Nairobi, Kenya's capital, have been mistreated and neglected, a BBC Africa Eye investigation has revealed. Secret filming shows staff members physically mistreating residents, dumping food directly onto tables without any plates, and leaving medical conditions untreated. \"Hit her on the buttocks. Beat her,\" a member of staff urges a stick-wielding colleague, at the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) Thogoto Care Home for the Aged, about 20km (12 miles) west of Nairobi. The undercover footage shows that moments before, three staff dressed in purple uniforms, surround an old woman by a metal gate flanked by sheets of corrugated iron at the perimeter of the home's garden. \"Where were you heading to on that side?\" asks one of the staff. \"You were called and refused to come back.\" The old woman, wearing a fleece and a bobble hat, appears confused and frightened. \"Oh, please forgive me,\" she says. \"Now we have to cane you,\" says one of the staff. A staff member can then be seen hitting the elderly woman's bottom with a wooden stick. This is just one example of evidence of mistreatment uncovered in the BBC Africa Eye investigation. The care home was set up by the Women's Guild of the local PCEA church but is now managed independently. It is home to around 50 elderly women and men. Over the last decade, the number of homes for the elderly is reported to have almost tripled in Nairobi. Many don't charge rent and are supported by local churches or rely on donations. In the next 30 years the elderly population in Africa is projected to triple from 75 million to 235 million, according to the United States Census Bureau report from 2020. Its growth will be faster than in any other region of the world, making the prospect of sending elderly relatives to a care home a reality for an increasing number of families. In 2020, the Kenyan broadcasting channel, Ebru Television, filmed inside Thogoto Care Home. The manager, Jane Gaturu, presented an image of a safe haven, where residents were well fed and cared for. BBC Africa Eye heard worrying reports this was not the case. Two undercover reporters got jobs at the care home and spent 14 weeks secretly filming inside the facility. As well as the footage of staff hitting the elderly woman with a cane, they recorded staff admitting to physically abusing other residents. \"Sometimes you have to use force,\" says a staff member, sitting outside under a canopy during a tea break. \"Even carers who start being polite, they find themselves being aggressive towards clients,\" she says. They go on to describe one man who \"is always being caned\". \"We beat him and that is what calms him down. Because if he gets angry, he can even hit you with a rock,\" she says. The reporters filmed further examples of apparent neglect and mistreatment, including medical conditions being left untreated. One elderly man was suffering with a serious skin problem. \"I'm feeling pain. Too much, too much. I feel like I'm burning,\" he can be heard saying in the footage, trying to show an undercover reporter his neck. He claims care home staff won't take him to hospital to be treated. The gravity of his skin condition is difficult to determine in the secret footage, but the undercover reporter says he was bleeding very badly. \"He gave money to Jane [Gaturu, the care home manager] to take him to hospital,\" the reporter says. \"He was not taken to hospital. And when he asked Jane, Jane was very angry with him. And she even told him: 'Your home is just around the corner, and your people have given up on you. Do you think I will be able to help you'?'' \"He used to tell me: 'We are waiting for death','' the reporter recalls. It took around six weeks before the man saw a doctor, with money provided by his family. In photos taken by an undercover reporter, white flaky skin covers his entire body from the waist to the top of his neck. It is not known what the condition was. Ms Gaturu declined to comment on whether she was given money for medical treatment and then did nothing. Government guidelines say residential homes should provide medical care for the residents. \"I personally was in pain when I see them suffering and I can't help,\" says the undercover reporter. \"I used to cry a lot. Most of the time I used to get to the toilet. I switch off my camera and cry.\" One of the undercover reporters filmed an elderly woman using her hands to eat food left directly on the table without a plate because she was unable to feed herself with a spoon. A former care worker said they witnessed similar scenes, describing how staff told her not to assist residents with their meals. \"They told me not to help them today because no-one would help them tomorrow,\" she says. An undercover reporter secretly filmed a conversation with a staff member about staff not feeding vulnerable residents. \"Do you think she will be the first to die of hunger here?\" the member of staff tells her. \"Many have died of hunger here. They [carers] deny them lunch, deny them dinner, all because they don't want to make time to come and feed them.\" Most of the food at the home is donated, and on three occasions the undercover reporters saw food being loaded into a senior staff member's car. An undercover reporter was also asked if she wanted to take residents' food from the facility, but declined. A former carer from the home alleged food was being stolen by staff. \"There was food there but most of the food was stolen. They overload the car with food. They overload the car with so much food it tilts,\" she says. BBC Africa Eye showed some of the undercover recordings to Joseph Motari, the principal secretary for social protection and senior citizens affairs - the Kenyan government member responsible for elderly care. \"Should we find anybody abusing, harassing, maiming these older persons, I can assure you the necessary punishment would be inflicted on whoever does that,\" he said. \"We are going to do spot-checks on various private homes and see as to whether they meet the standards that they should be having. We are willing to take action against any private-run old person's homes that mistreat them,\" he added. We put the allegations to Ms Gaturu. \"The home is a non-profit organisation run on a voluntary basis which depended entirely on donations from well-wishers,\" she said. She added that it does not have a professional medical team and relies on others to provide medical care, \"but that allegations they did not take care of residents who needed medical attention were lies and malice\". \"Residents who struggle to eat are given priority assistance and anyone seen carrying food away from the home should be dismissed. \"The home and the management do not condone any form of brutality or aggression towards the aged. Staff have been victims of attacks by residents. \"The home always observes the rule of law and remains guided by the Christian principles on which it was founded,\" Ms Gaturu said.",

        "title": "Barbie film hits $1bn mark at global box office",
        "content": "The Barbie film has hit the billion-dollar mark just 17 days after it was released, according to distributor Warner Bros. The movie will finish the weekend with $1.03bn (\u00a3808m) in ticket sales at the global box office, it said in a statement on Sunday. It means Greta Gerwig has become the first woman to reach the milestone as a solo director. Warner Bros described it as a \"watershed moment\". Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution in the US, said: \"No-one but Greta Gerwig could have brought this cross-generational icon and her world to life in such a funny, emotional and entertaining story... literally turning the entire world pink.\" He said that long lines in cinemas and repeat viewings \"prove that movies are back\" after the cinema industry suffered due to pandemic lockdowns and competition from streamers. Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, co-chairs and bosses of Warner Bros Motion Picture Group, described audiences as \"embracing the Barbie movie in a profound way\". The pink-hued film has received praise from critics and inspired scores of selfies at doll boxes installed in cinemas across the UK too. Starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, it has drawn in $459m so far in the US and $572m internationally. Achieving \"Barbillion\" - as described by Warner Bros - is no mean feat. Just five other films have done so since the pandemic, including The Super Mario Brothers Movie earlier this year, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Top Gun: Maverick, Jurassic World Dominion and the Avatar sequel. Cinema-goers have often paired a viewing of Barbie, which tells a coming-of-age story of the iconic doll, with Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer - a story about the development of the first atomic bomb. UK-based cinema chain Vue recently said both films had led to the firm seeing its busiest weekend in four years. Margot Robbie also served as one of the producers on Barbie. According to an interview with Collider, she banked on making a billion dollars in early meetings. \"I think I told them that it'd make a billion dollars, which maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make, okay?!\" she told the publication. The film's marketing campaign has been huge, with pink billboards installed in cities around the world while a pink Tardis also appeared at Tower Bridge. Toy-maker Mattel is hoping to repeat the same success with other films. Other Mattel brands - including Barney, Hot Wheels and Polly Pocket - are set to feature in upcoming Hollywood movies. It released a soundtrack album and entered into more than 165 consumer product partnerships for the Barbie film, although it recently reported that its sales fell by 12% for the three months to end of June.",

        "title": "UCC: Common law proposal sparks fear in India tribes",
        "content": "For many years now, Anil Jonko's life follows a simple routine. He starts his day by offering prayers at his parents' grave in Chaibasa, a small village in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand dominated by the Ho tribal community. The 40-year-old then heads to a special court - set up two years ago to deal with civil matters of local tribespeople - where he is fighting a land dispute case. In India, special courts for tribal communities have been established to protect their culture and distinct identity. While there is no official figure on their number, a similar system is found in the north-eastern states where tribal courts decide on matters of marriage, divorce, adoption and inheritance based on their own personal laws and customs. At the court which Mr Jonko visits, there is no lawyer or judge. Three village leaders - one named by the complainant, one by the respondent and the third named by the local administration - hand out \"verdicts\". Mr Jonko says he prefers going there because the staff comprises people from his community and all the cases are heard in the local Ho language. Ho is one of the many indigenous languages spoken in Jharkhand where 27% of the population is made of tribespeople. But Mr Jonko now worries that his village's unique justice system would cease to exist. The fears were sparked earlier this year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) proposed a plan to enact a Uniform Civil Code or UCC - a single personal law for all citizens irrespective of religion, sex, gender and sexual orientation. At the moment, there is no clarity on the contents of UCC as there is no draft of the law yet. But the government argues that a common code is necessary to achieve gender justice; equality through uniform application of personal laws in matters of marriage, divorce and inheritance; and to foster national unity. The BJP, in one of its election manifestoes, said there \"cannot be gender equality till such time India adopts a Uniform Civil Code\". Critics, however, say that any attempt to push for it would divide communities and lead to a loss of their distinct identity and culture. The proposal is largely seen as a counter to personal laws of Muslims - which the government says are \"regressive\" - as it seeks to consolidate Hindu votes for the BJP ahead of the 2024 general election. But it has triggered a wave of anxiety among tribespeople who fear that the proposal interferes with their centuries-old practices and customs. \"Right now, a non-tribal person cannot buy land in our village. With the UCC anyone would be able to do that,\" Mr Jonko says. \"Our culture and tribal practices will be be wiped away.\" In Jharkhand, special laws have been in force for decades to protect the distinct identity of the state's 8.6 million tribespeople. This includes a 1908 law that prohibits the transfer of tribal land to non-tribal communities to ensure community ownership, and a 1876 law which prohibits non-Santhal people from buying Santhal land without the permission of the district magistrate. The Santhals are a tribe that occupy the area of Jharkhand bordering West Bengal state. Similar laws also exist in the north-eastern states, where autonomous district councils are set up to protect the land and culture of tribal communities. Santosh Kido, professor at Xavier's College in Ranchi city, says that tribespeople fear that a UCC would wipe away their identity. \"These people identify as tribal because of their distinct culture, tradition and customary laws. If the government puts all of these in one basket there will be nothing left for them,\" he says. Dayamani Barla, an activist who has been fighting for the rights of tribespeople in Jharkhand, agrees with the assessment. She says the tribal system of governance and self-rule is deeply connected with their customs and any attempt to do away with that would undermine their autonomy. \"Besides, how can you have one law for a diverse country like India?\" she asks. However, supporters of a UCC argue that it is a much needed reform to end discriminatory practices prevalent in local traditions and customs. In most tribal societies of Jharkhand for instance, daughters have no share in her father or husband's property. \"A common set of personal laws would bring gender equality among tribespeople,\" says Amar Kumar Chowdhary, professor at Ranchi Technical University. Mr Chowdhary adds that a UCC would also help to integrate these communities better with \"the national mainstream\". \"If it is implemented properly, it will be good for everyone. We will all move forward together,\" he said. There is no clarity on how much of this would actually happen under the new law or when will it be implemented. But tribespeople in Jharkhand say they are bracing for an uncertain future. \"We don't know much, we only hear about things on the TV,\" Mr Jonko says. \"But we are poor and helpless and we know we won't be able to stop it if the UCC is implemented.\" BBC News India is now on YouTube.

        "title": "The Irish Light: Woman abused by paper which falsely said vaccine killed her son",
        "content": "A grieving mother and her lawyer have been targeted by an extreme campaign of abuse after suing a conspiracy theory newspaper which falsely claimed her son died from a Covid vaccine. The Irish Light repeatedly abused Edel Campbell online and its supporters have threatened her lawyer with \"execution\". Conspiracy theorists worldwide have used dozens of tragic deaths to spread vaccine misinformation. This case is thought to be the first where a relative has sued. The Irish Light included Ms Campbell's son, Diego Gilsenan, and 41 others in an article last year which suggested the \"untested and dangerous\" Covid vaccine was to blame for the deaths. In fact, the BBC has been told Diego had taken his own life in August 2021, aged 18, and had not been vaccinated. The campaign of abuse following her legal case has been \"nothing short of shocking\" and may explain why other relatives have not taken action, Ms Campbell's solicitor, Ciaran Mulholland, told BBC Radio 4's Marianna in Conspiracyland podcast. \"You can understand why a lot of people were incredibly reluctant to go to a solicitor when they saw the backlash with Edel Campbell,\" he said. Ms Campbell told the BBC that the Irish Light has \"made my life hell\" and said she's now fearful of speaking out. The BBC has agreed not to use a photo of Ms Campbell - or her son - for this story to protect her. In frequent social media posts over several weeks, the Irish Light and its editor, Gemma O'Doherty, have accused Ms Campbell of \"outrageous lies\", being \"mentally unstable\" and involved in a \"massive fraud\". There are also extreme references to suicide about Ms Campbell. According to Mr Mulholland, people who support the Irish Light have called for him to be executed or shot, as well as anonymously calling his office and threatening other members of staff. Ms Campbell and her solicitor decided to bring a civil case against Ms O'Doherty for harassment with defamation, after the paper published a photo of her son Diego Gilsenan and others on the front page under the headline \"Died Suddenly\". This tagline has been widely used across social media by conspiracy theory activists to suggest unexpected deaths of young people are related to the Covid-19 vaccine. In the article that featured Ms Campbell's son, the Irish Light claims that the establishment is not questioning the \"mysterious deaths\" because \"they know exactly what it is: the untested and dangerous injection they forced into the Irish people\". Deaths from Covid vaccines are extremely rare. UK figures record 55 deaths where the vaccine was given as the underlying cause, out of more than 50m people who have had at least one dose. Among some of the other young people featured by the Irish Light, one died in a swimming pool accident, another from a head injury and a third from meningitis, according to their families. Ms Campbell says the Irish Light did not contact her for comment about Diego before publication. The BBC also understands that the Irish Light did not contact several other family members of young people featured. Mr Mulholland said the aim of the legal case is not \"retribution\" or compensation. \"All Edel Campbell wanted was to protect the integrity of Diego, and her family as a whole,\" he said. Ms Campbell's legal case has been funded through donations and her lawyer's pro-bono work. He told the BBC the legal proceedings were launched after various attempts to ask Gemma O'Doherty to remove the images of Diego Gilsenan failed and resulted in an escalation in online abuse. In July, the High Court in Dublin granted a restraining order that prohibits the Irish Light editor from contacting Ms Campbell and from using or publishing the image of her son for any purpose without his mother's consent. Abusive posts about Ms Campbell have continued on social media, including from the Irish Light account on X, formerly known as Twitter, which Gemma O'Doherty has admitted to running. Ms Campbell made reports of harassment to the police - but Mr Mulholland says they are yet to contact or question Gemma O'Doherty about these. Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na - the Republic of Ireland's national police service - told the BBC that it \"does not comment on named individuals\" or \"specifics of on-going investigations\". It says it continues to \"actively investigate the alleged harassment of an individual in the North Western Region\" of Ireland. Ms O'Doherty and the Irish Light have not responded to the BBC's request for comment. However, on social media the Irish Light says the BBC will \"do a character assassination\" on Gemma O'Doherty because \"she exposed the vaccine genocide\". In online posts, Ms O'Doherty denies harassing Edel Cambell and continues to suggest her son's death was sinister or mysterious in some way. She has instructed a solicitor to defend the case brought against her. The Irish Light is a sister paper of its namesake in the UK, the Light, although they are editorially independent of each other. The BBC previously revealed the UK paper has called for the execution of politicians and doctors. It has links to the British far-right and a German publication connected to a failed coup attempt. As well as more innocuous features, the Irish Light has published stories promoting conspiracy theories such as \"Pfizer knew the vaccine would kill\", \"Water fluoridation is lowering Irish IQ\", \"Why manmade climate change is a fraud\" and \"Irish to become a minority in Ireland\". While Ms Campbell is thought to be the first to sue over a false claim about a vaccine death, the case has parallels with other victims of conspiracy theorists. Manchester Arena bomb survivors are suing over claims the attack was faked and parents of Sandy Hook mass shooting victims won a landmark ruling against Infowars host Alex Jones.

        "title": "Mother and baby dead, 30 missing after migrant boats sink off Italian coast",
        "content": "At least two people have died and more than 30 are believed to be missing after two ships carrying migrants sank off the Italian island of Lampedusa. The two boats reportedly left from the Tunisian port city of Sfax carrying 48 and 42 people, respectively. Italian coastguards said they had recovered the bodies of an Ivory Coast woman and her one-year-old baby. Separately, Tunisian officials said they found the bodies of 10 migrants on a beach near Sfax. The 10 people were found between Friday and Saturday during a windstorm that may have sunken their boat, the official told AFP news agency. Tunisian authorities say the port city is a popular gateway for migrants seeking a better life. Officials in Sfax - which is only about 80 miles (130km) from Italy's Lampedusa island - said they were working to identify the nationalities of the migrants, but they mostly came from sub-Saharan African countries. Italian authorities said they were investigating the incidents. Italy's coastguard said it had rescued 57 migrants when the vessels sank on Saturday, about 23 nautical miles (46 km) south-west of Lampedusa. Earlier, the UN's migration agency, the International Organization for Migration, said more than 30 people had been reported missing. The tragedies follows June's Greek boat disaster which left at least 78 dead and hundreds missing. On Sunday, firefighters and mountain rescue teams were preparing to rescue 20 migrants trapped on a rocky part of Lampedusa's coastline. The migrants have been there since late Friday after strong winds pushed the boats against the rocks. After more than two days of sailing in bad weather, NGO Open Arms said it had started disembarking 195 rescued migrants in the southern Italian port of Brindisi. Police chief Emanuele Ricifari, who is in charge of the investigation, told local media the traffickers would have known that rough seas were forecast. \"Whoever allowed them, or forced them, to leave with this sea is an unscrupulous criminal lunatic,\" Mr Ricifari said. In recent days, Italian patrol boats and charity groups have rescued another 2,000 people who have arrived on the island. The Red Cross has provided some of the migrants with food, water, clothes and emergency thermal blankets. But the coastguard has said bad weather and the poor quality of the boats continue to hinder the rescue operations. In some instances, the engines are stolen from the boats at sea, so that traffickers can reuse them. Mr Ricifari, urging the traffickers to stop, said: \"Rough seas are forecast for the next few days. Let's hope they stop. It's sending them to slaughter with this sea.\" NGOs say Italy's far-right government has made their task more difficult by passing laws that have the effect of forcing rescue ships to use faraway ports. Charities have warned that this increases their navigation costs and reduces the amount of time ships can patrol the areas of the Mediterranean where such disasters are common. The Italian interior ministry said migration figures by sea had doubled this year to 92,000, compared with 42,600 recorded in the same period in 2022. Since March this year, crossing attempts from Sfax to Lampedusa have increased after Tunisian President Kais Saied accused sub-Saharan migrants of trying to change the nature of Tunisian society. More than 1,800 people have lost their lives in the Central Mediterranean crossing from North Africa to Europe - thought to be the world's deadliest. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said the actual figures were likely to be much higher. \"Lots of bodies are being found at sea, suggesting there are many shipwrecks we never hear about,\" said IOM spokesman Flavio Di Giacomo.",

Sana news agency is quoting a military source as saying the strike near the capital Damascus also caused some material damage. Some of the Israeli missiles were shot down, the source claims. Israel has so far made no comments. It frequently targets military sites in Syria linked to Iran-backed militants. AFP news agency says its correspondent in Damascus reported hearing the sound of explosions. Footage has also emerged on social media purportedly showing bright flashes in the sky in the vicinity of Damascus. In February, Syria accused Israel of killing four civilians and a soldier in missile strikes on Damascus. Israel's military rarely acknowledges specific strikes on targets in Syria, where Iran's influence has grown in recent years. Israel and Iran are bitter foes and in recent years have been engaged in what has been described as a \"shadow war\" of unclaimed attacks on each other's assets, infrastructure and nationals.",

        "content": "At least 30 people have been killed and 100 injured when a train derailed in southern Pakistan, a police spokesman has confirmed. Several carriages of the Hazara Express overturned near Sahara railway station in Nawabshah, about 275km (171 miles) from the largest city Karachi. Wounded passengers were moved to nearby hospitals. Rescue teams are trying to free people from the twisted wreckage. Accidents on Pakistan's antiquated railway system are not uncommon. Videos posted on social media showed dozens of people at the site of the accident, with some passengers climbing out of the overturned carriages. One passenger who survived told BBC Urdu he had seen many women and children lying on the ground. \"They were shouting and screaming. I didn't know what to do. I filled my hands with water from this canal nearby and poured it on the faces of those who were unconscious, hoping they would regain consciousness,\" Naseer Ahmed said. Nasser said he survived the accident because he \"fell out of the window when the train derailed\". Aslam, who was on the train with his son, said: \"We were sleeping when suddenly the carriage came down and [it felt like] an apocalypse.\" Railway Minister Saad Rafiq said initial investigations showed the train was travelling at normal speed and they were trying to establish what led to the derailment. It could be the result of a mechanical fault or sabotage, he added. Authorities have dismissed reports the track was flooded. A railways spokesperson in Karachi said at least eight carriages went off the track. He said military and paramilitary troops along with rescue workers were on the scene and helped to rescue passengers trapped inside the train carriages. The most seriously injured passengers were transported to distant, better-equipped hospitals in military helicopters. Officials said rescue operations were completed in the early evening on Sunday. An emergency has been declared in the main hospitals in Nawabshah and neighbouring districts of Sindh. Train services to the interior districts of Sindh have been suspended. Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon told BBC News that the government's top priority was \"the rescue work, which we are totally focused on\". In 2021, two trains travelling in Sindh province collided, killing at least 40 people and injuring dozens. Between 2013 and 2019, 150 people died in such incidents, according to local media reports.",

        "content": "A Russian \"guided bomb\" has hit a blood transfusion centre in north-eastern Ukraine, killing two people and injuring four, Ukrainian officials say. Volodymyr Zelensky posted an image of the building on fire as a result of Saturday night's attack around Kupiansk, in the Kharkiv region. \"This war crime alone says everything about Russian aggression,\" he said. Russia has not commented. It has previously denied all allegations of targeting civilians - or war crimes. The city of Kupiansk and nearby settlements were seized by Russian troops in the first few days of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022. The area was liberated during a Ukrainian counter-offensive last September, but comes under missiles and shelling daily. In a post on social media, Mr Zelensky described the perpetrators as \"beasts\". \"Defeating terrorists is a matter of honour for everyone who values life,\" he added. Mr Zelensky did not give details of the casualties. But local officials later posted the same image adding details about the attack on what they described as a non-residential building. President Zelensky also said that on Saturday Russia separately carried out a missile attack, targeting an aeronautical company run by group Motor Sich in the western Khmelnytskyi region. On Sunday, Russia's air defences destroyed a drone as it approached Moscow, the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said. Last week, an office block on a Moscow skyscraper was hit two days in a row by Ukrainian drones, Russian authorities said. Ukraine has not publicly admitted carrying out such attacks. Moscow has also accused Ukraine on Saturday of hitting a Russian tanker with 11 crew members in the Black Sea - the second such sea drone attack in as many days. Russian maritime officials said the engine room of the Sig tanker was damaged in the attack in the Kerch Strait. No-one was injured. The Kerch Strait connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, separating Crimea - Ukraine's peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014 - and Russia's Taman peninsula. Ukraine has not publicly commented. But a Ukrainian security service source told the BBC a sea drone had been used. In another development, the Chonhar road bridge linking mainland Ukraine to Crimea was hit by a Ukrainian missile strike on Sunday, according to Russia's RIA news agency. This is the second time Ukrainian missiles have hit the bridge after an earlier attack in June forced it to close for repairs. Moscow-installed Kherson regional governor Vladimir Saldo wrote on Telegram that another small bridge, connecting the port city of Henichesk and the narrow Arabat Spit on Crimea's north-east coast, had been shelled. A civilian driver was hurt and a gas pipeline was damaged, leaving 20,000 people without gas.",

        "title": "Shutdown Threat Intensifies as Congress Leaves",
        "content": "House Republican leaders on Thursday postponed votes for a must-pass government funding bill and dismissed lawmakers to start a six-week recess, raising the risk of a government shutdown in September amid simmering internal conflicts over spending levels and hot-button social issues. The move to punt the bill\u2014which would fund the Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration\u2014sets up a new round of budget fights in September when lawmakers return to Washington with only 12 work days in the House that month. With budget disagreements unresolved despite numerous rounds of amendments and heated discussions in July, lawmakers in the House are expected to leave the Hill on Thursday evening and return on Sept. 12 to a lengthy to-do list that includes passing 11 of the 12 annual appropriations bills. The decision to adjourn with just a single passage vote on the annual spending bills marks a significant setback for GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who had hoped his party would pass as many annual appropriations bills as possible before leaving for recess. But a push by conservatives to pressure GOP leaders to further slash the funding levels for various government agencies and include a provision in the agriculture and FDA bill that would limit access to an abortion pill have upended those plans. \u201cWe should use a government shutdown as a leverage point if necessary,\u201d Rep. Bob Good, a Virginia Republican, said this week. \u201cMost of what we do up here is bad anyway.\u201d House conservatives have pressured Republican leaders to make deeper cuts and attach language to the funding bills on abortion, transgender care, and other social issues that Democrats and some moderate Republicans oppose, including a provision that would nullify a Biden Administration rule allowing the abortion pill mifepristone to be sold in retail pharmacies and by mail with prescriptions from a certified health care provider. Moderate Republicans had voiced their opposition to the abortion provision, warning that they will not support the agriculture and FDA bill unless it is stripped. \u201cI have said from the very beginning that I would not support legislation that would ban abortion nationwide,\u201d Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, said Wednesday. \u201cAnd to me, some of these issues that are being dealt with should be dealt with at the state level, and that\u2019s it. Some states allow it to be mailed, some states don\u2019t. But that should be a decision with the states and the FDA.\u201d Heading into recess, the abortion pill provision remains a main point of contention. McCarthy can only afford to lose a handful of Republicans and still clear the funding bill, but didn't specify when asked by reporters whether he would take out the abortion language: \u201cRegardless of how you feel on this position, you shouldn\u2019t use taxpayer money [for that],\u201d he said at a press conference on Thursday. These were all debates McCarthy had hoped to resolve over the summer. The impasse highlights how little time Republicans have to reconcile their differences before a government shutdown, during which some parts of the government stop working at full capacity as it did in 2013 and twice in 2018. A shutdown, which could come as soon as Sept. 30, would also mean hundreds of thousands of government employees in the affected agencies would go unpaid. House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark criticized Republicans for piling up spending bill votes in September, arguing that lawmakers should stay in Washington to strip out the \"divisive\" measures in the bills and make more progress before recess. \u201cWe have one bill out of 12 completed because extremists are holding your conference hostage,\u201d Clark said on the House floor. \u201cThis is a reckless march to a MAGA shutdown.\u201d",

        "content": "In the first half of the U.S. Women National Team\u2019s (USWNT) group stage matchup against the Netherlands on Wednesday night in Wellington, New Zealand, American midfielder and co-captain Lindsey Horan found herself exasperated, arms extended, since her teammates missed her open on the pitch. In the second half, Horan found herself chippy, fired up and physical, exchanging pushes with a Dutch player\u2014and pro club teammate\u2014who tackled her too hard. This time, however, Horan would take out her frustration on the soccer ball. With her head. And America averted a World Cup disaster. The game ended in a 1-1 draw: Horan\u2019s second half aerial goal, off a Rose Lavelle corner kick, deadlocked the game in the 62nd minute. The U.S. controlled the game after Horan\u2019s score, failing to convert a few opportunities but walking away with a point. (The Americans held a 17-4 advantage in attempts at goal). Both the U.S. and the Netherlands now have four points in their group. Neither team has yet clinched a place in the knockout round, the result the Americans in particular were surely expecting. Both teams have some work to do in their final group stage games. But both the Americans and the Netherlands are in a strong position to advance. Sign up for \u2018Extra Time,\u2019 our new newsletter that will break down the biggest moments from the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup The Netherlands had taken the lead early. In the 17th minute, the Dutch patiently dissected the U.S. defense and Jill Roord found herself largely unbothered near the top of the 18-yard box. Eight U.S. defenders were in the box with her. But they weren\u2019t close enough to Roord. Her angular strike went through Horan\u2019s legs\u2014she had quite an unpleasant first half\u2014and through the rest of the defense and into the net. The Americans now trailed in a World Cup game for the first time since 2011. In the 47th minute, American defender Crystal Dunn had the ball on her foot, out wide to the left. Four Netherlands players honed in on Dunn. Horan stood in the middle of the pitch, arms extended, incredulous that Dunn wasn\u2019t sending a diagonal pass her way, to push the American attack and perhaps create a much-needed scoring chance against the Dutch. Dunn sent the ball back to Naomi Garma, who also missed Horan, who put her arms out in exasperation for a second time. Dunn got the ball back and pushed it up the sideline\u2014Horan was still open. Dunn and Sophia Smith exchanged passes: Smith, who before the World Cup talked about the singular focus that overcomes her when she sniffs a scoring opportunity, dribbled into the teeth of the Netherlands defense. Horan\u2019s arms went up a third time. Smith lost possession.

For Horan and her teammates, the halftime whistle couldn\u2019t come soon enough. They all needed to regroup. And the switch flipped for the Americans after the break. First off, Lavelle entered the game and provided a spark, almost immediately earning a yellow card for an aggressive tackle. Her instant message: the U.S. would not fall flat in this half. To that end, moments later Danielle van de Donk hit Horan hard. The U.S. co-captain needed some quick treatment on the sideline. When she returned for a corner kick, Horan let van de Donk, her teammate at Lyon, know she didn\u2019t appreciate such roughness. They exchanged trash talk and pushes. The ref tried to get them to make amends. Neither was really having it. Horan, however, got the upper hand: the ensuing corner kick to shut down the chatter. Lavelle lifted the ball towards the box. \u201cRose put in an absolute dime,\u201d Horan said afterwards. Horan leapt and scored the game-tying header. Turns out that the U.S. would avert its first group stage loss since 2011, a year they reached the World Cup final but lost to Japan. When the match ended, Horan and van de Donk exchanged pleasantries and hugged. All\u2019s fair in World Cup competition: the pair could go back to being buddies now. Luckily for the Americans, however, Horan saved the sportsmanship for after the final whistle. She got full-on ticked. At just the right moment.",

        "title": "Inside the Los Alamos Lab Making Nuclear Bomb Parts Again",
        "content": "Something unusual is happening inside the plutonium facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. PF-4, as it is known to top government officials, is the heart of America\u2019s nuclear complex, a lab where scientists and engineers study and experiment on highly radioactive materials in tight secrecy. Recently, employees have discovered yellow plastic tents encasing equipment and rendering it inaccessible. At Los Alamos, where even the cleaning crews and firefighters require high-level security clearances, you might think the tents are designed to restrict access to the latest wonder weapon or scientific breakthrough. The truth is more mundane\u2014and more telling. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our expansion plans,\u201d Matthew Johnson, a senior lab manager, tells me during a rare tour of the fortified building. \u201cAll the old stuff is coming out.\u201d PF-4 is being transformed from an experimental laboratory that focuses mostly on research into a facility that mass-produces plutonium \u201cpits,\u201d the grapefruit-sized cores inside every nuclear bomb in America\u2019s arsenal. Los Alamos\u2014 the lab synonymous with the dark art of nuclear-weapon development\u2014hasn\u2019t produced a certified pit in over a decade and has never had to produce more than 10 in a single year. But in 2018, Congress passed a law mandating that PF-4 produce 30 pits a year by 2026. Around $5 billion has already been spent to overhaul the cramped, aging facilities. The Biden Administration has pumped $4.6 billion into Los Alamos this fiscal year alone\u2014a 130% budget increase over what the lab received just five years ago. Truckloads of new work stations, lathes, and furnaces are set for installation. Coast-to-coast recruiting efforts are underway to increase the lab\u2019s workforce, which is already at a record 17,273. Not long ago, such ambitions would have been unthinkable. Following the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991, the U.S. stopped designing, building, and testing new nuclear warheads. Stockpiles were slashed, labs\u2019 budgets cut, and a highly skilled workforce allowed to dwindle. But after a three-decade break from manufacturing nuclear weapons, the U.S. is getting back into the game. Another arms race may be upon us, triggered by China\u2019s growing ambitions and escalating hostilities with Russia, the world\u2019s other nuclear superpower. Since President Biden took office, both nations have wielded their arsenals to threaten adversaries and coerce neighbors. The last remaining nuclear-arms treaty, known as New START, is set to expire in 2026, raising fears about a new era of unchecked expansion. All nine nuclear powers are scrambling to modernize their arsenals and build new weapons. The effort to restart America\u2019s nuclear-weapons manufacturing program in response represents the biggest test since the Manhattan Project. A wide range of arms-control experts and nuclear watchdogs, as well as a handful of lawmakers, are frantically sounding the alarms, warning of the existential risks of the course that leaders in both parties have taken. Critics say the U.S. is repeating the mistakes of the Cold War by funneling billions of taxpayer dollars into weapons that will hopefully never be used and haven\u2019t been tested in more than a generation. They worry about the potential environmental disasters. Washington is reacting to geopolitical concerns without considering the consequences of restarting our own bomb-making factories, says Greg Mello, executive director at the Los Alamos Study Group, an Albuquerque-based watchdog organization. \u201cWe\u2019re rushing into a new arms race with our eyes wide shut,\u201d Mello says, \u201cforgetting everything that went wrong before.\u201d At PF-4, they are well past such debates. Lab managers are busy unsealing and combing through decades-old archives to extract the technical and engineering expertise for plutonium pits that has been all but lost in the U.S. To get a sense of how the headlong rush is unfolding, and the risks that come with it, I accompanied Johnson, a tall, balding metallurgist who\u2019s spent 21 years at the lab, as he led a small group of reporters on a rare trip inside the center of PF-4. It took more than a year to receive government approval for the visit to the facility. All plutonium operations are required to pause if outsiders are on the floor. But with a brief work-stoppage in place, we were given a day pass in late June to slip behind the tiers of barbed-wire fences, code-accessed security doors, and legions of armed guards to catch a glimpse of America\u2019s new nuclear age. Before stepping onto the PF-4 operations floor, we pulled on thick lab coats, cotton shoe-coverings, protective goggles, and personal radiation-detection badges. It\u2019s a windowless, low-slung facility, with a long gray hallway dividing a series of rooms purpose-built for plutonium production. Identity confirmation is required at each door, even though every employee at PF-4 has a Q-level security clearance from the Energy Department, the highest a civilian can hold. Weapons-grade plutonium has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years. The level of radioactivity in these rooms, called \u201chot areas,\u201d is constantly monitored. When you walk into a new chamber, you\u2019re met with the unnerving clicks of a Geiger counter reverberating inside. The personal-safety protocols underline the stakes. One member of our tour had a notebook quarantined after it mistakenly dropped to the floor. Before leaving a room, we had our hands and feet individually checked for contamination. We also were required to take two full body-scans, stepping into different floor-to-ceiling radiation-detection machines, before we left the facility. Inside each production room, workers stand under bright fluorescent lights by a series of linked stainless-steel work stations called gloveboxes. They place their hands into specialized rubber gloves and peer through leaded-glass windows as they shape the plutonium. An accidental slip of the hand could result in catastrophe. There\u2019s virtually no safe level of human exposure to plutonium if it\u2019s inhaled. Even the smallest speck\u2014a one-thousandth of a gram, hidden to the human eye\u2014could kill. \u201cWe have to account for every flake,\u201d Johnson says. The lab has an elaborate air circulation system; the rooms are at a lower pressure than the outside hallways. Each glovebox has a slight vacuum, designed to ensure that if there is a breach, the particles are contained inside the sealed box. The U.S. no longer manufactures new plutonium, so workers at PF-4 take old pits from retired warheads sent from the Pantex plant in the Texas panhandle, which assembles, disassembles, and stores parts for America\u2019s nuclear arsenal. The pits are recycled through a process that purifies them of radioactive elements, which accumulate over time. To do this, plutonium winds its way from glovebox to glovebox through an overhead trolley system snaking through the complex. Dumbwaiters move it up and down from the trolley. The plutonium is melted, machined, welded, and inspected. Mastering these skills can take up to four years of training and mentorship, Johnson says. Each worker must undergo routine mental and physical health checks throughout the year to ensure they can handle weapon components. Up to 1,000 employees work inside PF-4 on a given day, but less than 10 can perform the final step of the assembly, which involves welding pieces of cast plutonium together to form a pit. The task must be done by hand, inside a large walk-in glovebox. Workers wear respirators and several layers of personal protective equipment. The pit then undergoes an inspection process: it\u2019s leak-checked and radiographed, like a medical CT scan, to ensure it meets specifications. If it passes, it\u2019s stamped with a small diamond and sent back to Texas, where it will stay until it\u2019s plugged into a new W87-1 warhead, which is still under development, expected to be completed sometime within the next decade. The W87-1 will be the first 100% newly manufactured nuclear warhead in the U.S. stockpile since the end of the Cold War. Its pit will be encased in plastic explosives designed to detonate with impeccable timing, compressing it, in just a fraction of a second, from the size of a grapefruit into the size of a golf ball. Fission from this first stage of the process spits out neutrons, triggering an atomic chain reaction that generates a massive release of energy\u2014an explosion. The subsequent radiation, pressure, and energy then fuses two types of heavy hydrogen, tritium and deuterium, to form helium. Additional neutrons fire from this process, creating a fission-fusion feedback loop that happens so quickly it appears instantaneous. It culminates with a fireball that reaches into the millions of degrees, followed by a blast that can level buildings for miles around. Read More: Donald Trump is Playing a Dangerous Game of Nuclear Poker. Los Alamos has made 11 development pits so far this year, but none of them are destined for warheads. The first proof-of-concept weaponized pit is slated for completion at the end of 2024, says Robert Webster, Los Alamos\u2019 deputy director for weapons. Webster says he\u2019s confident his team can reach 30 pits per year by 2030. \u201cIt could be sooner,\u201d he says, adding that the most important thing is that it\u2019s done right. \u201cWe\u2019re still cleaning up the legacy mess that we made by working the way we did.\u201d Others are skeptical. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in January that it\u2019s highly unlikely PF-4 will be able to meet its congressional mandate of building 30 pits annually on the prescribed timetable. Another larger facility, the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, which has never produced a single pit, has been tasked with producing 50 per year by 2030. The challenges of building new facilities and re-configuring existing ones with cutting-edge equipment are compounded by the extreme dangers of radioactive plutonium and waste disposal. All this may result in the federal government spending up to $24 billion before Los Alamos and Savannah River can reach their combined target of 80 pits per year, the report says. And rushing has its risks.  The environmental hazards of producing plutonium pits are well-established. The last time the U.S. made pits on a mass scale was in 1989, at the Rocky Flats site in Colorado. Production at the plant, which churned out about 1,000 pits per year, was shut down following a raid by the FBI and Environmental Protection Agency that discovered serious environmental violations. There was enough radioactive waste on the premises to cover a football field to a depth of 20 ft. Some 62 pounds of plutonium were found caked inside the plant\u2019s air ducts. Plutonium poses grave danger to anyone who doesn\u2019t have proper protective equipment, and the total human toll of the work performed at Rocky Flats is unknown. Judy Padilla, 76, worked 22 years at Rocky Flats, most of them handling plutonium in gloveboxes. Padilla says she\u2019s horrified that another generation will be manufacturing pits. She developed a host of medical issues that began during her time at the plant, including a tumor that required a mastectomy of her right breast. Her husband Charles, who also worked at the plant, died in 2014 after battling kidney cancer. Padilla, who attributes both cases to radiation and chemical exposure at Rocky Flats, received $125,000 from the government after Charles died. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, passed at the end of the Clinton Administration, provides funding to former nuclear employees on an individual basis, but Padilla says it\u2019s littered with loopholes that are better designed to deny claimants than help them. \u201cMy advice to younger people doing this work is: Be careful,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought my government would back me up if I got sick and take care of me. That never happened. It sounds really bitter. But yeah, I\u2019m bitter. I consider myself a walking time-bomb.\u201d The safety record of Los Alamos has always been intensely scrutinized, particularly in the post-Cold War years. \u201cIs There Really a Cowboy Culture of Arrogance at Los Alamos?\u201d ran a Dec. 2004 headline in the trade publication Physics Today. The question followed a series of high-profile lapses at the lab, including a trove of missing classified documents and an incident in which an intern suffered an eye injury from a laser. The biggest blunder arguably came in 2011, when technicians took a photograph of eight ingots of plutonium lined up side-by-side on a work table to impress their bosses. It may have looked cool to them, but putting radioactive rods in close proximity risked triggering a chain reaction that could have produced a fatal burst of radiation, capable of killing anyone in the room. Plutonium pit production ended the following year, and hasn\u2019t restarted until now. In 2018, Triad National Security was named as the new contractor to run the lab for the U.S. Energy Department. The company has stated that safety is a core pillar of its operations, including pit production. But workers\u2019 missteps continue to be cited by the the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, which provides independent federal oversight. Jill Hruby, head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Energy Department agency that oversees nuclear weapons, wrote a letter in May to Triad for a formal explanation on four \u201cnuclear safety events\u201d that took place between February and July 2021. The incidents included two separate floods, a glovebox breach, and an instance in which an unsafe amount of fissionable material was placed in a dropbox. An investigation attached to the letter noted a \u201csignificant lack of attention or carelessness\u201d for worker and public safety.  Mistakes like these only heighten skepticism about how Los Alamos can possibly mass-produce plutonium pits on the appointed schedule without risking the health of its workers and surrounding community. Lab officials recognize that the project will generate unprecedented levels of hazardous waste. The most radioactive waste Los Alamos produces, called transuranic waste, primarily involves contaminated gloves, tools, equipment, and other debris that are typically stuffed into 55-gallon drums stored on site until they can be hauled to an underground facility in southeastern New Mexico. The lab projected the number of drums to spike to 2,000 this year, double the tally of just three years ago, according to a 2021 report delivered to Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to comprehend the level of contamination, the diversion of amounts of money into something that, in my view, will not improve national security,\u201d says Jay Coghlan, executive director of Nuclear Watch New Mexico, a Santa Fe-based watchdog. The dangers, of course, stretch far beyond New Mexico. Dread of nuclear annihilation hung over the globe throughout the Cold War. That fear is practically inscribed by history in the creosote-dotted hills around Los Alamos, the birthplace of The Bomb. Located atop a secluded mesa between the Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains, its transformation from a high desert outpost into a boomtown began in 1943, when more than 8,000 scientists, soldiers, and other personnel arrived to work for the Manhattan Project\u2019s secret \u201cSite Y\u201d laboratory, under the direction of the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. The picturesque setting for Oppenheimer\u2019s pursuit of an atomic bomb contributed to the sense of insularity. Outsiders were not welcome. The people who worked and lived at Los Alamos were bound by secrecy and, with few exceptions, unable to leave. To this day, the people on this isolated plateau say they\u2019re \u201con the hill,\u201d which by default means that everyone else in the world is \u201coff\u201d it. But the ingrained seclusion of Los Alamos isn\u2019t just semantic and geographic. It\u2019s hard to find anyone in the community of 13,000 who doesn\u2019t either work at the lab or have a neighbor, friend, or family member who does. It is a company town where even the street names gesture to its controversial past: Oppenheimer Drive, Trinity Drive, Manhattan Loop. The lab developed the first atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed and maimed hundreds of thousands of Japanese in 1945. Those were crude, comparatively simple devices that produced explosive yields measured in kilotons, or thousands of tons of TNT. In the arms race that ensued over the following decades, weapons designers at Los Alamos came up with ever more lightweight and destructive weapons\u2014some so small that they allowed for a dozen city-busting warheads to fit inside a single ballistic missile\u2019s nose cone. Today\u2019s staged-thermonuclear devices produce explosive yields measured in megatons, or millions of tons of TNT\u2014weapons far more lethal than Oppenheimer\u2019s original. When the U.S. began pursuing such bombs, Oppenheimer discouraged it, calling them a \u201cweapon of genocide.\u201d Oppenheimer envisioned the A-bomb program as a one-off for a narrow mission. Instead, nuclear bomb-making became a full-fledged American industry. Los Alamos was just one facet of a nationwide nuclear-industrial complex, cranking out weapons components for an arsenal that the U.S. wielded to deter the Soviet Union\u2019s aggression by threatening \u201cmassive retaliation\u201d and \u201cmutually assured destruction.\u201d In 1967, around the height of the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear stockpile reached 31,255. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, nuclear weapons-production stalled. The number of U.S. sites involved in making warheads was cut in half. President George H.W. Bush declared a self-imposed nuclear-weapons testing moratorium in 1992. The number of warheads in the U.S. stockpile was continually reduced through a series of arms-control treaties with Moscow. Today the nuclear stockpile stands at an estimated 5,244 warheads\u2014an 83% reduction from its Cold War peak. Read More: The $100 Billion Mission to Modernize America\u2019s Aging Nuclear Missiles. The reduction brought challenges: if the U.S. could no longer build or design the next world-altering bomb, what could government officials do to retain the expertise of scientists? And how would the ensure the integrity of the arsenal without being able to test the products? Nuclear bombs contain more than 4,000 parts, and most of those parts are now more than 30 years old. Ask yourself: If you left a 1993 Ford Mustang in the barn\u2014a temperature-controlled vault of a barn, but a barn nonetheless\u2014would you feel 100% certain that everything would work properly when you turned the ignition? Oh, and don\u2019t forget that your life may depend on it. The answer the Energy Department came up with was to harness computer simulations and experiments to evaluate the reliability\u2014and extend the life spans of\u2014America\u2019s nuclear weapons. The most vexing dilemma was assessing plutonium, an element only discovered 80 years ago. To find out how it ages, Los Alamos ran experiments in the early 2000s that found plutonium pits changed over the years in ways that could impact weapons\u2019 performance. But the studies couldn\u2019t provide specifics on when exactly plutonium aged out. At first, scientists concluded the pits should last for 100 years or more. But in 2019, after Congress began pushing for more pits, JASON, the long-time independent scientific advisory group to the U.S. government, urged the Energy Department to reestablish large-scale pit production \u201cas expeditiously as possible to mitigate against potential risks posed by (plutonium) aging on the stockpile.\u201d The day before my tour of PF-4, I visited the modernistic three-story Municipal Building in Los Alamos to see how the small town was preparing for the coming influx of scientists, technicians, engineers, security guards and support staff. \u201cWe\u2019re building as fast as we can,\u201d says Paul Andrus, the community-development director. Roads are being widened. Expansion plans are underway for Atomic City mass transit. Wooden skeletons of condos and housing developments are in the process of getting built in any area they\u2019ll fit. But finding suitable spots for new construction is a challenge. In addition to the nearly 40-sq. mi. lab, Los Alamos is hemmed in by canyons and abuts Bandelier National Monument. The lack of housing is concerning not only because of the incoming workers, but also the teachers, doctors, and other professionals who will be needed alongside them. \u201cWe\u2019re just out of space,\u201d says Denise Derkacs, a former lab employee who now serves on the county council. \u201cWe would love to help support the lab more, but we just have no more land to build on.\u201d This lack of available space has forced Los Alamos to forge closer ties with communities off the hill. The lab leased two buildings in Santa Fe, located more than 30 miles to the southeast, where it moved hundreds of employees not involved in classified work. The transition, which began in 2021, marked the first time in a half century that the lab had a presence in the city. The pace of expansion is stunning to those familiar with Los Alamos, including Siegfried Hecker, who served as lab director from 1986 to 1997. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the Cold War, but it\u2019s a Cold War-like environment,\u201d Hecker told me. \u201cI did not expect a renewed arms competition when I left Los Alamos.\u201d In the last two years of his term at the lab, Hecker signed the first annual letters of certification attesting to the safety, security, and reliability of the weapons in the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Those letters, delivered each year to the U.S. secretaries of defense and energy, reads in part: \u201cI certify that the nuclear weapons we designed are safe and reliable without the resumption of nuclear testing at this time.\u201d Every sitting president must have this letter on his or her desk to have complete confidence in the nuclear arsenal. Hecker told me signing that letter marked a consequential moment in his life, and in the history of the nation. Resuming pit production is necessary, Hecker believes, because of the unanswered questions about how plutonium ages. But he anticipates the process will trigger calls to resume underground weapons testing in Nevada, in order to redouble confidence in the old stuff and to ensure the new stuff works. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government will do that, because that will open Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we go back and test, we will lose more than we gain.\u201d Of the nine nuclear powers, only North Korea has tested in this century. If the U.S. begins doing so, other nations are sure to follow suit. In the high-stakes world of nuclear weapons, a single political decision sets off an unpredictable chain reaction that can put us all at risk. As we enter this new nuclear era, it\u2019s not yet clear how much we\u2019ve learned from the past.\u2014With reporting by Leslie Dickstein TIME receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Outrider Foundation.

        "title": "Life Expectancy Proves How Far Black Americans Have Come",
        "content": "In August 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that over the last two years, Black Americans\u2019 life expectancy declined to about 71 years old, six years lower than their white counterparts. National disparities in life expectancy can represent the permanency of racism, offering little reason for hope. But in Manassas Park, Va. and Weld County, Colo., the mean-life expectancy for Black residents is 96\u2014a national high among all Black citizens by county. Black people are living in their 80s in larger Democratic jurisdictions like Montgomery County, Maryland and smaller Republican districts like Collier County, Florida. My colleague Jonathan Rothwell and I reported hundreds of places that exceed commonly held expectations in Brookings\u2019s recently released Black Progress Index, an interactive tool and report developed in partnership with the NAACP that provides a means to understand the health and well-being of Black people and the conditions that shape their lives. Instead of comparing Black people to white people, we examine life expectancy differences among the Black population in different places. This method reveals the locales where Black people are thriving. Researchers often sloppily compare rates of home ownership, educational attainment, income and mortality without attending to past and present discrimination that intended to create disparities. Consequently, broad national averages void of context policy and local contexts camouflage the very real progress that\u2019s occurring across the country. Still, in places like Jefferson County, Ohio, the average Black person lives 33 fewer years than Manassas Park, Va. and Weld County, Colo. That gap is roughly equivalent to 100 years of progress in living standards, medical science, and public health. Black people are not a monolith. They have widely different outcomes in very different places. Local contexts matter as Black people do. Lower life expectancy in counties and metro areas across the country suggests that people are losing battles against racism. But geographic areas where Black people are thriving offer more than hope: People\u2019s civic actions are delivering positive change. Read More: Why John Lewis Kept Telling the Story of Civil Rights, Even Though It Hurt What accounts for such vast differences? Life expectancy, a cumulative measure of health and well-being, summarizes both the biological and non-biological influences on our lives.\u202fBecause race is a sociological construct and not a biological one, we should assume disparities in life expectancy represent differences in non-biological influences on our lives. Our current life expectancy data suggest that people are breaking down specific social conditions that influence longevity, giving real reason for optimism. Using a common machine-learning algorithm to select variables and rank their importance, the Index identifies 13 social conditions that predict Black life expectancy.\u202fMany are those one might expect, such as income, education, housing, and family composition. Others were more surprising, including the top predictor of high Black life expectancy: larger shares of foreign-born Black residents. One standard deviation above the mean in this variable adds one year to predicted life Black expectancy. For instance, Brooklyn, N.Y. is in the 89th percentile of life expectancy at 78.5. The more than 43% of Black residents of King\u2019s County who are immigrants, places it in the 98th percentile among all counties. The cause for this interpretation is unclear; it may be a pure composition effect, in that foreign-born Black Americans enjoy better health than the native Black population. Though, this data points to a larger question: Is less exposure to U.S. racism good for your health? On the other end of the spectrum, a surprising predictor of low Black life expectancy is religious membership. Keeping in mind all the social determinants that showed to be significant in our study are correlational, not causal. Revoking a church membership will not automatically add years to a person\u2019s life. The challenge is understanding why religious adherence is associated with lower life expectancy. Church goers are more likely to be obese and, on the surface, asking \u201cJesus to take the wheel\u201d may negate any agency we have in influencing our health outcome. We also know that place-based bias that comes out of the wash of housing devaluation hurts the families and institutions, including churches, in those locales. More research is needed to uncover the conditions and behaviors underlying all the variables that strongly influence life expectancy. The fact that we realize progress and stagnation in Black life expectancy in different places makes clear that people have agency. The gains and losses reflect that. When we take an overly optimistic or pessimistic view of the state of Black America and treat Black people as a monolith, we don\u2019t see localized stories of growth, determination, and thriving. The diversity of places where Black people are thriving suggests that it has something to do with Black people themselves. In places like Montgomery County, Md., individuals, civil rights groups, organizers, and politicians are dismantling the architecture of inequality that takes away years of life. That said, we still need to examine and throw away the overly optimistic position on race relations\u2014that the country has moved beyond slavery, Jim Crow racism, and the array of discriminatory policies and their long-term effects. People who hold this perspective contend that America is a level playing field and that with effort, Black people can achieve anything a white person can. But locales that post life expectancies under 70 perform poorly on environment or institutional indicators like the air and school quality, suggesting that life is harder in some places due to systemically racist forces. In Lowndes County, Ala. where Montgomery is the county seat, Black life expectancy is 68.5. In Greenwood, Miss., it\u2019s 67.3. In Salem, Ore., life expectancy is 64.4. It\u2019s also worth speculating on seemingly obvious reason why some cities, like Jackson, Miss., don\u2019t post higher rates than 72.6. Jackson has higher homeownership rates than most places (94th percentile) and a higher percentage business ownership (59th percentile). But the recent water crises show how local politics of Mississippi play out in lower investments in the city\u2019s water infrastructure, which plays out in other municipal services that impact life expectancy like education. \u201cSocial reforms move slowly,\u201d wrote W.E.B. Du Bois, suggesting that we must learn from our circumstances in ways that reject intemperance and blame. \u201c[W]hen Right is reinforced by calm but persistent Progress we\u202fsomehow all feel that in the end it must triumph.\u201d Society is toiling with the same struggles around racism that Du Bois faced at the turn of the 20th century. Nonetheless, we must take the time to recognize empirical signs of progress and not rush toward unsophisticated, untruthful narratives of hopelessness or blind ignorance that remove or dismiss our agency. A path of progress demands that we have a clear view of the social, political, and economic landscape in which we live. Recognizing progress and defeats will have us see the very real capacity for future change. The assumption\u2014backed with data\u2014that Black people in places with higher life expectancy had a hand in their outcomes should inspire us to seek change in places where discrimination is robbing people of years of life.",

        "title": "A Hive Mind of Doctors Means Better Care for Patients",
        "content": "If you\u2019re like an unlucky 5% of American adults, you\u2019ll visit a doctor with a medical complaint this year, only to be misdiagnosed and, often, misprescribed a treatment. If you\u2019re like a far less lucky one of 100,000 hospitalized Americans, such a misdiagnosis will cost you your life. There are a lot of reasons for medical errors: inexperienced caregivers; ambiguous symptoms; understaffed hospitals, underlying conditions.  But according to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), there\u2019s one more little-considered cause: doctors working alone\u2014often with too little opportunity to think and rethink the case. By increasing the number of physicians weighing in on a case, doctors can significantly increase the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis and a favorable result, according to a team of researchers led by Damon Centola, professor and director of the Network Dynamics Group at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication.. \u201cWe are increasingly recognizing that clinical decision-making should be viewed as a team effort that includes multiple clinicians and the patient as well,\u201d said co-author Dr. Elaine Khoong, of the University of California, San Francisco, and the San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, in a statement accompanying the release of the study. Medical collaboration is hardly a new thing. As Centola points out, many hospitals, especially ones in lower-income areas, rely on \u201ce-consult technologies,\u201d in which a clinician sends a message to an outside specialist for a second opinion on a case, with results usually taking 24 to 72 hours to come back. But two minds, Centola and his collaborators theorized, are less effective than a hive mind\u2014and they set out to prove that idea. Recruiting a subject group of 2,941 physicians, the authors divided them into a sample group of 2,053 and a control group of 888. All of the subjects were drawn from one of three specialties: internal medicine, emergency medicine, and cardiology. All of them too were presented with case studies of real-life patients who had presented with illnesses known to have high rates of diagnostic error: acute cardiac events, geriatric care, low back pain, and diabetes-related cardiovascular illness prevention. Then they were set to work diagnosing the cases and prescribing a treatment\u2014a process that was divided into three steps, which both groups conducted in different ways. The 888 members of the control group worked alone. They read the case scenario and were given two minutes (sometimes all a doctor gets in an emergency situation) to provide a risk assessment\u2014how serious the patient\u2019s symptoms were, and what the likelihood of severe illness was\u2014and recommend a treatment. This was repeated two more times, with the members of the control group given a second and a third opportunity to re-read and reconsider the case\u2014again with a two-minute timeline, but at least with greater familiarity of the scenario now\u2014and again recommend a treatment.

The 2,053 members of the sample group were divided into smaller groups of 40 each. All of them began the experiment the same way the control group did\u2014taking two minutes to read, diagnose and recommend a treatment for the case study. They too were given a second chance to analyze the case, but before they did, they were also shown the average risk estimate the other 39 doctors in their group\u2014whose identities were not disclosed\u2014had given for the severity of the case. They could then either stick with their initial assessment of the severity of the condition or change it to one more in keeping with the majority. In the third round they did the same, only this time with their treatment recommendation. Both groups benefited from the opportunity to take multiple looks at the same case. In the control group, the doctors improved from an accuracy rate of 76.8% in the first look they took at the case study to 79.3% by the third\u2014or a 3.3% improvement. The sample group, in which the doctors had the benefit of one another\u2019s insights\u2014doubled the improvement of the control group, going from an accuracy of 76.1% to 81.1%, or a 6.6% bump. (There was no indication in the results of the hive mind in the 2,053-person sample leading the doctors to a collective wrong conclusion.) Over a potential U.S. patient population of 332 million, that 6.6% improvement can mean 21.8 million people. \u201cWe can use doctors\u2019 networks to improve their performance,\u201d said Centola in a statement. \u201cThe real discovery here is that we can structure the information-sharing networks among doctors to substantially increase their clinical intelligence.\u201d What\u2019s more, Centola thinks the 40-doctor model his group hit on is a good one. \u201cForty people in a network gets you a steep jump in clinicians\u2019 collective intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe increasing returns above that\u2014going, say, from 40 to 4,000\u2014are minimal.\u201d What\u2019s more, in the sample group, whose members not only read the case study three times, but also read their peers\u2019 responses, the entire trial still took only 20 minutes\u2014far less than the 24 to 72 hours a single-specialist consultation now takes. Effective as the protocol is, there are obstacles to implementing it widely. The amount of time physicians have to spare on cases that are not their own, and reimbursement policies for their work, are both issues to be resolved. More challenging. Centola says, is changing the culture around the business of diagnosing and prescribing\u2014which is too often seen as an entirely solitary practice. \"This network innovation,\" he says, \"replaces that view of decision-making with the insight that it is also a social and behavioral process that can be improved by structuring the flow of information and influence among clinicians.\" When it comes to saving human lives, speed counts, accurate diagnoses count, and getting the right treatment to the right patient counts. If it takes 40 doctors to get all that right, it\u2019s worth the extra work.",

        "content": "If you follow politics on social media, video clips of long-shot 2024 presidential candidates have likely been all over your feeds recently, sitting in studios or offices with podcast microphones pressed to their faces. In recent months, Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Republican Vivek Ramaswamy have embarked on a podcast blitz, using their campaigns as calling cards for any show that will have them on\u2014from obscure history, wellness or crypto podcasts to Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter Spaces and Joe Rogan\u2019s popular program. It\u2019s an approach driven by necessity: television networks and media outlets tend to give long-shots little airtime or attention compared to the leading candidates. But as Kennedy and Ramaswamy have recognized, hundreds of podcasts and livestreams are happy to offer fringe contenders the opportunity to expound on their views for hours, usually without being challenged or fact-checked. Video clips of the exchanges are then widely disseminated across social platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Twitter, reaching bigger audiences than many traditional media outlets. Read More: Inside the Very Online Campaign of RFK Jr. It\u2019s a test run of a new kind of strategy for the social-media era: make yourself impossible to ignore by flooding the online ecosystem with appearances on alternate platforms. The resulting headlines often inflate the candidates\u2019 importance or support, and could ultimately become a headache for President Joe Biden or the Republican frontrunners. These kinds of candidates have \u201cfigured out a style of weaponized contrarianism that garners a lot of engagement,\u201d says Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab. \u201cIt\u2019s this \u2018vibes only\u2019 approach to mass media.\u201d For Kennedy, podcasts and alternative platforms offer a chance to speak to large audiences after more than 15 years of being relegated to the fringes for his anti-vaccine activism. Now, the views that once got him banned from social media for violating disinformation policies are being widely circulated on the same platforms through clips of his podcast appearances. \u201cOur strategy is not complex or targeted\u2026[but] we\u2019re getting a lot of traction,\u201d Kennedy told TIME in an interview in June, explaining that he views podcasts as a medium he can use to his advantage the same way his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, used television in the 1960s. \u201cIt\u2019s just about telling the truth to people and listening to what they say\u2026and big groups of people are listening. So that\u2019s nice.\u201d After appearing on Rogan\u2019s massively popular podcast on June 15, Kennedy\u2019s 2021 book The Real Anthony Fauci\u2014in which he accuses the top U.S. infectious-disease doctor of orchestrating \u201ca historic coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Western democracy\u201d\u2014shot up to become the #10 best-selling book on Amazon, his publisher says. It has sold more than 100,000 copies since he announced his presidential run. \u201cI\u2019m not attracted at all to soundbite politics,\u201d Kennedy explained in a June 8 interview with TIME. \u201cI\u2019m better at kind of explaining the complexities of issues, so I think [podcasts] are a much better medium for me. And the weird thing about it is that people are listening, particularly young people.\u201d For Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old biotech entrepreneur, the attention podcasts can bring has helped build name recognition and a larger online following. Previously little-known to most Republican voters, Ramaswamy announced in April that he was launching a daily podcast called \u201cThe Vivek Show,\u201d to \u201cpull back the curtain on the political process.\u201d It\u2019s reportedly part of a $10 million investment in media production that he plans to continue even if he drops his presidential bid, which is built on a promise to take the America First agenda \u201cfurther than Trump.\u201d Since that rollout, Ramaswamy has posted 55 episodes\u2013an average of one episode every day and a half. He\u2019s interviewed a host of conservative personalities, including former Attorney General Bill Barr and former NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch. In the meantime, he has gone on more than 70 podcasts himself, delivering polished, video-clip-friendly talking points to conservative commentators like Dan Bongino and Jordan Peterson as well as appearing on shows like \u201cRetirement Talk\u201d and \u201cAlmost 30,\u201d a women\u2019s wellness podcast. Read More: Why Vivek Ramaswamy is Defending Trump More Forcefully Than Other 2024 Contenders. The medium comes with a significant audience. Despite an increasingly saturated market, podcasts have continued to grow in popularity over the last decade. As of 2023, 42% of Americans over the age of 12 listen to at least one podcast per month, according to Edison Research, up from 12% in 2013. Political podcasts in particular have taken off, with everyone from Trump adviser Steve Bannon to former Obama strategist David Axelrod and Sen. Ted Cruz hosting regular conversations which are increasingly filmed and distributed as short clips. In right-wing media, these podcasts and online shows seem to have stepped into the role of conservative talk radio, creating popular commentators like Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino. The podcast strategy won\u2019t necessarily translate into votes. Ramaswamy is currently averaging 3% in polling nationally. While Kennedy started off polling around 20% with Democrats largely due to his name ID, analysts predict his track record of espousing conspiracies and increasingly close ties to right-wing personalities ultimately won\u2019t fly with party voters\u2014in one June poll, his net favorability among Democrats had fallen from 18% to 7%, while it jumped to 29% among Republicans. But to these candidates, the polls may not be the point. What matters is the exposure the medium provides\u2014and the fact they will continue to get more of it if they, and the people they\u2019re speaking to, are very loud and very online. \u201cThis is the first time there\u2019s someone actually speaking my language,\u201d says Justin Rezvani, a 34-year-old social media entrepreneur and Kennedy supporter who says he has never voted in a presidential election before but likes the candidate\u2019s views on cryptocurrency and censorship. \u201cIt\u2019s my personal belief that the 2024 election will not be determined by mainstream media approach\u2026but will be built upon this decentralized podcast and creator network that distributes the message.\u201d",

        "content": "In 2019, we decided to host anti-racism events in white women\u2019s dining rooms for one specific reason: To turn the age-old adage, \u201cit\u2019s rude to talk about politics at the dinner table\u201d on its head. This is what we\u2019ve learned\u2014if you don\u2019t talk about racism, you can\u2019t dismantle it. But it isn\u2019t just over the dinner table that this \u201cniceness\u201d rules. In the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020, you were eager, frenzied even, to do this work. A mere two years later, not only is that excitement for anti-racism work gone, the pendulum has swung in the other direction, into a verifiable whitelash against anti-racism work. If white womanhood is a house, your need to be perfect is the foundation. It is this need for perfection that makes it impossible to engage in antiracism work. Being perfect is the key to your happiness, to your success, to your very existence. Perfect hair. Perfect clothes. Perfect grades. Perfect nails. Perfect weddings. Perfect bodies. Perfect adoring and supportive wife and mother. Perfect employee and colleague. White skin. The foundational principle of perfection in a white supremacist society like ours is rooted in whiteness. Without it, your A\u2019s will never be straight enough, your MVP trophies not shiny enough, your flowery dresses a bit wilted. Of course, white skin alone doesn\u2019t render you perfect, but without it, you have no chance. White skin is a necessary (yet still insufficient) ingredient of perfection. The con, of course, is there is no actual recipe for perfection, as there is no such thing as perfection. Read More: How the \u2018Karen Meme\u2019 Confronts the Violent History of White Womanhood This makes your endless quest for perfection a trap. You will never be pretty enough. You will never be thin enough. You will never be smart enough or successful enough or rich enough. You will never be enough. Yet white women will die trying. Especially over dinner. We call it the \u201cThree Point Plan for Perfectionism.\u201d It goes like this: You\u2019ve been taught generation after generation that talking about politics over a meal is rude. Being rude is the enemy of perfection. Being perfect is your number one life goal, so you will not talk about racism. White women regularly mention having been \u201cburned\u201d on social media for saying the \u201cwrong thing.\u201d You have been publicly humiliated, often at the hands of a fellow white woman, who is angling to show you how much more perfect she is at antiracism work. Yes, you even compete in the antiracism space. Getting called out makes you want to stop the work, to stop engaging. If you aren\u2019t already perfect at it, then you don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. Yet if you stop the work, you can\u2019t make progress. Then there are those situations in which the critique of you is coming from a woman of color. This will hit you in a deeply uncomfortable place. After all, you are not used to having us challenge you\u2014and on a topic we absolutely know more about: being on the receiving end of racism. This, in particular, infuriates white women. Us publicly calling you out on your racism. Us publicly telling you that you are not perfect. Antiracism work depends on your acknowledging your imperfections, namely how you have been born into and nurtured by a white supremacist society. This means acknowledging that you are not the expert on how it feels to be on the receiving end of racism, which means you do not get to decide what is and is not racist. Just like men don\u2019t get to decide what is and is not sexist. It means acknowledging that you will get it wrong, that you will feel embarrassed, and that you will struggle to make progress. In spite of these obstacles and this necessary discomfort, you will have to pick yourself up and get back into the work\u2014work that is messy, not tidy. Work that is tables turned upside down, not neatly set. Work that is imperfect. So, why show up? Why do this work now? Because you must. You\u2019ll do it because not only is it the right thing to do, but you know that your lives, and your kids\u2019 and your grandkids\u2019 lives, depend on your showing up, even when things get hard. You will show up because you understand that white supremacy hurts you too. You are doing this not to save us, but to free yourselves. So the next time you think things like, \u201cI didn\u2019t pipe up on Facebook because I don\u2019t want to be attacked,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to say the wrong thing,\u201d or \u201cThe last time I called someone out at a dinner party, my husband was grumpy with me for a week,\u201d think about this: The only wrong move is remaining silent, sitting on the sidelines, accepting your role in white supremacy. Don\u2019t do nothing out of the fear of doing it imperfectly. Get in there. Read. Listen. Learn. Speak up. Speak out. Show up. Roll up your sleeves. And when you receive criticism, consider that maybe it\u2019s just that: a critique, and not an attack. Maybe this disagreement isn\u2019t a fight. Maybe you don\u2019t know more than the Black, Indigenous, or brown woman attempting to set you straight. And isn\u2019t freedom from white supremacy worth some level of conflict? Isn\u2019t it more important to eradicate racism than to be liked by everybody? You\u2019ve never been liked by everybody in the first place! In the end, you cannot even start the process of extracting white supremacy until you extract the need to be perfect. The need to be perfect is not just harmful to us, it\u2019s harmful to you. Aren\u2019t you tired of never being enough?

        "title": "Racism Is Not a Mental Illness\u2014But It\u2019s Complicated",
        "content": "Everyone knows that Law & Order plotlines are often, as they say, ripped from the headlines. But Dr. Alvin Poussaint, 88, knows this on another level: An emeritus professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, he has had the unusual experience of seeing his ideas incorporated into a season 12 episode of the long-running show. In it, a white working stiff murders a Black CEO in a dispute over a New York City taxicab. When the trial begins, a respected Black psychiatrist takes the stand to present his idea that the defendant suffers from \u201cextreme racism,\u201d a mental illness. His lawyers argue that extreme racism has such a complete hold on the defendant that it mitigates their client\u2019s legal responsibility for the murder. In the final moments, the audience is encouraged to feel that it\u2019s a victory for justice, for law and order, when the jury rejects the psychiatrist\u2019s ideas, Poussaint tells me with a tinge of disdain. In the real world, Poussaint was that psychiatrist. Sort of. While he never brought his ideas to the witness stand inside the New York City courthouse behind those massive stone steps that Law & Order made famous, in 1999 he shared his theories on the link between mental health and extreme forms of bigotry on the op-ed pages of the New York Times. In doing so, he helped set off a debate that ended with the American psychiatric establishment publicly rejecting the concept\u2014partly on the grounds that so many people are racists. But even now, after nearly a decade during which the number of hate crimes has steadily increased, the question of the relationship between bigotry and mental illness has never fully been resolved. In fact, recent high-profile incidents have made public perception of that dynamic perhaps as muddled as ever. The issue comes up in relation to everything from major mass shootings to pop-culture discourse. The racist attack at a Buffalo, N.Y., supermarket, for which the gunman pleaded guilty this week to state murder and domestic terrorism charges, prompted calls for the country to \u201cget serious about mental health\u201d as well as pleas not to talk about the shooting as a matter of psychiatric illness rather than a racist hate crime. Read more: Anti-Black Violence Has Long Been the Most Common American Hate Crime\u2014And We Still Don\u2019t Know the Full Extent It\u2019s hard to distinguish what psychiatric experts have decided not to define, to separate what Poussaint calls \u201ceveryday racism\u201d\u2014covering the span from systemic discrimination to microaggressions\u2014from the extreme version, which he and others have described as the point at which bigotry so deeply shapes behavior that a person struggles to function and sometimes becomes dangerous. But the question is more than just a thought experiment. If extreme racism were to become accepted as a mental illness per se, more suspects in hate-crime cases could potentially have recourse to mount \u201cinsanity\u201d defenses in court. And given all the mass shootings and disturbing public events in which extreme racism appears to have played some part since Poussaint first described his ideas, it\u2019s also hard not to wonder. Might developing a research-backed extreme-racism diagnosis\u2014and sound treatments\u2014have saved lives? Though the FBI typically releases data each fall detailing the prior year\u2019s hate-crimes statistics, the agency has not yet done so in 2022. But social conditions are rife, experts say, for the increase to continue. (In 2020, the most recent year for which FBI data is available, the agency reported 8,263 incidents\u2014an increase of nearly a thousand over the prior year, despite 452 fewer agencies reporting\u2014and most experts believe the real number is higher.) Police have noted that 47 out of 100 people arrested for hate crimes in New York City in early 2022 \u201chave prior documentation of an [emotionally disturbed person] incident.\u201d So the stakes are high for the nation\u2019s courtrooms to respond to the trauma unleashed by that dynamic\u2014and for Americans to decide what constitutes a just outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d says Sander Gilman, a historian at Emory University who researches the relationship between health, science, law, and society, and who has long taught a course on extremism. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to start with two things that I call Gilman\u2019s Law: not all racists are crazy, but crazy people can be racists.\u201d Thanks in part to the influence of pop culture\u2014not least those TV police procedurals\u2014many assume that insanity pleas are common. In reality, mental-health defenses are rare, and even more rarely lead to reduced punishment. Mounting that kind of defense requires time and significant resources to gather evidence and expert testimony, so in practice it is not an avenue available to all defendants. In England and the U.S., courts began to reliably consider the mental health of defendants only in the 19th century. The M\u2019Naghten rule, a standard for determining a defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of a crime, was established in 1840s England. It holds that only the sane can be held responsible for their actions. As a result, the question of mental fitness\u2014sufficient sanity to participate meaningfully in one\u2019s own defense\u2014is sometimes evaluated before a trial. (Whether the state has an obligation or right to treat such an illness in order for the person to then stand trial is, Gilman says, a question that goes back as far as the idea of such a defense.) Once a competency decision has been made, the accused who do go to trial have the right to a defense. In some cases, that may include an option for a jury to find the defendant not guilty by reason of mental disorder. In others, ideas about the mental health of the defendant may more informally shape what evidence is presented. But so-called \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d defenses are used in only about 1% of cases, says Michael Boucai, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law and an expert on mental health and other social issues in courtrooms. Those defenses are successful in even fewer cases; in fact, such a tactic often backfires or results in a defendant confined for a longer term inside a hospital than that person would have spent in prison, sometimes with no end date. And even rarer\u2014though not unheard of\u2014is an attempt to use racism or other bigotry as an indicator of mental-health challenges, he says. \u201cI think it would be extremely hard,\u201d says Boucai, \u201cI mean extremely hard, to succeed on the theory that extreme racism per se\u2014particularly subscription to a theory\u2014is a mental illness for the purpose of criminal responsibility. Just because you have a psychologist or psychiatrist saying this person is mentally ill does not mean the law has to [accept] that.\u201d (Nor does the defendant: Dylann Roof, the white man who shot and killed nine Black worshippers inside a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015\u2014whose legal team used words like \u201cdelusional,\u201d \u201cabnormal,\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d to describe their client\u2014rejected advice from his lawyers to attempt to avoid the death penalty by allowing them to argue that he was insane or suffering from a mental defect at the time of the shooting.) Some fear that raising mental-health issues in court runs the risk of bolstering inaccurate myths about the mentally ill. In reality, mentally ill people are disproportionately more likely to become the victims of crime, and most do nothing to victimize others. And, as has been observed after so many headlinemaking crimes, suspects from privileged groups are more likely to have their actions described as illness in need of treatment instead of criminal evil meriting punishment. Some experts fear that shifting the conversation to questions of mental health can also draw attention away from hateful ideas embraced by the person accused of the crime\u2014ideas that are today often shared by people, including public figures, whose mental health is not questioned. That\u2019s how important social problems that require the nation\u2019s attention are transformed into one individual\u2019s medical problems, says W. Carson Byrd, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. Column: We Need to Take Action to Address the Mental Health Crisis in This Pandemic That line of thinking is particularly problematic in a culture prone to dismiss the need for systemwide reforms to address inequality, Byrd says. It can foster an emphasis on quick fixes for the world\u2019s long-standing problems with bigotry. (In 2012, for example, a team of British researchers announced that an existing heart and blood-pressure drug appeared to reduce implicit bias after a study involving just 36 subjects.) \u201cWhite supremacy is a very normal part of society,\u201d says Byrd, who is also the faculty director of research initiatives at his university\u2019s National Center for Institutional Diversity. It is not a good or productive part of society, he points out, but a deeply entrenched one. \u201cOne of the detriments of trying to look at racism as a form of psychopathology or mental illness is that it makes that [illness] abhorrent, as if everything else is working in a certain [non-racist] way.\u201d Research has also long shown that bigotry is not an inborn human trait, but rather something learned from our environments, Byrd says. While racism can influence one\u2019s mental health, describing racism itself\u2014even \u201cextreme racism\u201d\u2014as a mental illness implies that bigotry exists beyond our individual and collective control. \u201cBy medicalizing [extreme racism], making it something curable, a mental-health disorder, it pulls away from having those broader conversations about how society is impacting people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just try to figure out, \u2018How do we fix this one person?\u2019\u201d This problem, Boucai notes, can already be clearly seen in discussions about gun crime, and mass shootings in particular: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to understand these crimes and the discourse of insanity provides one way to do it,\u201d says Boucai. \u201cBut I think we can see where that sort of language is irresponsible and potentially undermines a just result.\u201d In other words, if a mass shooter is simply insane, then wholesale gun-law reform can, to some, seem unnecessary, even unwise. When bigotry is involved, that supposed insanity might, some who oppose Poussaint\u2019s ideas believe, undermine systemwide efforts toward equity\u2014or at least toward greater safety for those most likely to be targeted. In 1999, when Poussaint wrote his op-ed advocating for increased research into possible psychiatric treatments for extreme racism, he was the author of acclaimed books about the effects of racism on Black mental health and a veteran of public controversy. Years earlier he\u2019d argued publicly that racial pride among Black Americans could be taken to an unhealthy extreme. By the 1990s, he may have been best known for his work with Bill Cosby, consulting on scripts for The Cosby Show in a massively popular effort to disrupt stereotypes. Poussaint first published his ideas about extreme racism weeks after a man named Buford O. Furrow Jr. shot and seriously injured four children and an adult inside a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, then shot and killed a nearby Asian-American postal worker. When captured and ultimately convicted, Furrow told investigators his actions had been motivated by hate. Reporters unearthed information indicating that Furrow had close relationships with known white nationalists, and also that he had been evaluated by Washington State\u2019s mental-health system only months before the attack. He\u2019d even told officials after a previous arrest for assault that he\u2019d \u201cfantasized,\u201d about mass murder. To Poussaint, this story signaled a growing threat posed by a failure to recognize that, while highlighting and combating systemic racism is important in preventing discrimination, so is identifying and helping individuals motivated by bigotry who might go so far as to injure or kill others. Read more: 11 People Were Killed in 48 Hours in Mass Shootings Across America. It\u2019s Likely to Get Worse The idea had been brewing for years. In 1993, a Jamaican immigrant named Colin Ferguson had shot and killed six people and injured 19 aboard a New York commuter train after years of personal struggles that he blamed on white and Asian people, whom he referred to as \u201cdevils.\u201d Ferguson had been pinned down by passengers on the train to stop the shooting but, while defending himself at trial, he argued that someone else committed the crime. (Ferguson\u2019s lawyers had planned to argue that he was insane at the time, suffering from something called \u201cBlack rage,\u201d another condition debated but not officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and that was the subject of a Law & Order episode.) After the train shootings, Poussaint\u2014a Haitian-American son of immigrants\u2014had noted Ferguson\u2019s trajectory: racist thinking, delusions that had come to dominate his life, then mass violence. This was a textbook case of extreme racism. \u201cExtreme racism crosses the line and is out of control,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust like somebody can have a little bit of anxiety, but if they have anxiety to the point that it is immobilizing, then it is a mental disorder.\u201d Mass shooters behind hate crimes are, as he sees it, in a similar state: \u201c[They] weren\u2019t functioning individuals. They were impaired by their mental pathology.\u201d When the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the guide that mental-health professionals use to make their diagnoses, was published in 1980, clinicians like Poussaint considered racism\u2014not extreme racism, but what he calls everyday racism\u2014a potential symptom of several conditions, from paranoid personality disorder to generalized anxiety disorder. Racism alone is not sufficient to diagnose a patient with one of those conditions, but an extreme racist, Poussaint says, likely suffers from delusions. Such people live with multiple symptoms including paranoia; they are likely to project negative traits or outcomes onto entire groups and sustain those beliefs even in the face of strong countervailing evidence. Many embrace conspiracy theories. Some may grow violent. In fact, Poussaint argued in a 2002 Western Journal of Medicine article, the extreme racist often begins with \u201cverbal expression of antagonism, progresses to avoidance of members of disliked groups, then to active discrimination against them, to physical attack, and finally to extermination (lynchings, massacres, genocide). That fifth point on the scale, the acting out of extermination fantasies, is readily classifiable as delusional behavior.\u201d Poussaint was not the first person to raise the idea that extreme racism is itself a mental illness. But he was among those leading the call for the American Psychiatric Association, publishers of the DSM, to consider putting it in subsequent editions of the manual, which has a long history of evolving, often slowly, in response to research and norms. When his op-ed ran, it seemed to Poussaint, people pounced. Some of his fellow Black psychiatrists argued that such a diagnosis would unleash a wave of legal excuse-making, helping no one but the violent racists themselves. Poussaint counters that other health diagnoses have yet\u2014nearly 200 years after psychological concerns officially entered American courtrooms\u2014to produce rafts of acquittals. And some clinicians and researchers argued that there are other ways of attacking racism besides treating it as an illness\u2014educational programs, diversity initiatives, policy changes. That\u2019s a point Poussaint says he doesn\u2019t oppose, at least when it comes to everyday racism. Those steps can help racists who embrace repugnant ideas while remaining functional parts of society. But those aren\u2019t the people he\u2019s talking about. \u201cRacism negatively impacts public health,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association told TIME in a statement. \u201cThe American Psychiatric Association has been focusing on this in the DSM by identifying and addressing the impact of structural racism on the over- or underdiagnosis of mental disorders in certain ethno-racial groups. From time to time we have received proposals to create a diagnosis of extreme racism but they have not met the criteria identified for creating new disorders.\u201d To this day, Poussaint believes that extreme racism is very likely its own disorder in need of study, possible diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment, he told me in September from his home in Massachusetts. But after retiring about 2\u00bd years ago at the age of 86, he says he\u2019s too far out of the professional mix to continue to push for an extreme racism diagnosis. I ask Poussaint what he thinks might have happened if extreme racism had become its own diagnosable condition listed in the DSM. Extreme racism might have been a topic on talk shows and a more frequent topic of news coverage, he says. With research and public information campaigns, the need for intervention could have been as clear as it is for heart attacks; the steps to do so as well-known as CPR. \u201cWe\u2019d get away from treating it as if [extreme racism] is normative,\u201d Poussaint says, \u201clike a cultural difference because America is a racist country. We have made it normative by not calling it what it is. Even people in general society, friends and relatives and even the afflicted individual, would recognize it as a disorder and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alright.\u2019 People who get swept up by anxiety and can\u2019t function, they don\u2019t think they are normal. They say, \u2018This is taking over my life. I need some help.\u2019 [A diagnosis] clues the family to say, \u2018This person is really troubled and we have to get them some help.\u2019\u201d \u2014with reporting by Solcyre Burga, Mariah Espada and Simmone Shah",

The suspect was then shot dead by another municipal patrol worker, Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai told Israel\u2019s public broadcaster. The Israeli police said in a statement that the shooter was a 27-year-old resident of the Palestinian town of Jenin in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian militant group Hamas praised the attack but did not take responsibility. The police officer was shot a day after a Palestinian teenager was killed in an attack by Israeli civilians on a Palestinian village in the West Bank. Washington has expressed concern over a growing number of attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinian villages in the West Bank, where violence has worsened since last year with increased Israeli raids amid Palestinian street attacks on Israelis. Huldai said the municipal worker had approached the attacker after noticing something suspicious and was then fired at by the shooter. A second municipal worker then killed the shooter. \u201cWe are standing at a very sad incident,\u201d Huldai said. \u201cWe are praying for the well-being of the injured.\u201d In brief statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the actions of the municipal patrol officers. Despite the attack, tens of thousands protested in Tel Aviv, according to the Israeli public broadcaster, against the governing coalition\u2019s planned judicial overhaul which would see the highest court stripped of much of its powers. Proponents of the legislation say it would restore balance to the branches of government, while those against say it would remove checks on government powers. Last month, the coalition passed legislation that removed the court\u2019s power to strike down government actions based on an action's being classified as \u201cunreasonable.\u201d",

        "content": "For the first time in more than seven decades, drivers in Oregon are allowed to pump their own gas. Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek signed a bill on Friday that lets drivers choose between dispensing fuel themselves or having an attendant pump the gas for them. The new law, which takes effect immediately, leaves New Jersey as the only state that prohibits self-service gas stations. Still, stations in Oregon will not be allowed to have more self-service pumps than ones designated for full service. The state's 72-year ban on self-service pumps was due in large part to safety concerns for drivers. A state law cited \"increased risk of crime and the increased risk of personal injury resulting from slipping on slick surfaces.\" The state Legislature sent the self-service legislation to the governor's desk this summer. The state Senate passed the bill in June in a 16-9 vote, three months after the House passed the measure 47 to 10. State Sen. Lew Frederick, a Democrat who opposed the legislation, said in a floor speech in June that the move would make it more difficult for the elderly to get help pumping gas and lead to job loss. \"I have personally had to get out and pump gas for elderly folks in other states whom I witnessed were not able to get the assistance they were legally entitled to,\" Frederick said. \"Oregon flies with her own wings. I am not convinced that just because other states do something, we have to as well.\" Oregon had made some exceptions to the ban, particularly in rural areas. Friday\u2019s bill signing lifts the restrictions statewide. Mike Freese, a lobbyist for Oregon Fuels Association, testified earlier this year in support of lifting the ban, telling a legislative committee that employee shortages had made it hard to keep some stations open. \"It is no secret that Oregon has unique gas fueling laws,\" Freese told legislators. \"Nevertheless, as explained by gas station owners, finding employees to pump gas is extremely hard \u2013 and even impossible in some cases \u2013 which in turn makes it impossible to keep gas stations open and operating.\" Enactment of the Oregon law means New Jersey is the only state that does not allow self-service pumps. The state's ban dates back to 1949.",

        "title": "After 3 lackluster matches, knockout play begins for U.S. World Cup team",
        "content": "MELBOURNE \u2014 Good has so far been barely good enough for the United States women\u2019s soccer team, as its quest to win a third straight World Cup has been marred by uncharacteristically mediocre play. The one-sided scores and dominating play that USWNT fans have come to expect have yet to materialize in two weeks of competition, prompting observers to wonder if U.S. command of women\u2019s soccer has come to an end. So U.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski said he fully understands the stakes ahead of America's knockout match Sunday against Sweden. \"I have to think if it\u2019s the most important game of my career, but it certainly is the most important game of the tournament,\" he told reporters Saturday in Melbourne. \"It\u2019s the knockout stage and there\u2019s no room for mistakes. So we have to be ready to be our best in this game.\" By failing to win Group E, the Americans are paying a heavy toll by having to face world No. 3-ranked Sweden in the round of 16 in Melbourne. The Swedes dominated Group G, outscoring their opponents, 9-1, in earning a date with the struggling Americans. In the goal-less Portugal match on Tuesday, in which the U.S. was saved by a goal post during a stoppage time shot, which could have done the unthinkable and sent the U.S. home in group play. \"There\u2019s no sugarcoating it, we had a bad game against Portugal and we are lucky we have moved on from that and are looking forward to this match,\" U.S. veteran Alex Morgan said. In wining once and drawing twice in group play, the United States has outshot Vietnam, the Netherlands and Portugal by a cumulative, 53-8, put more efforts on net, 19-1, and won more corner kicks, 26-2. As seemingly impressive as those numbers might be, they\u2019re down from America\u2019s three wins in 2019 group play, when the U.S. outshot Thailand, Chile and Sweden by a cumulative, 73-8, put more efforts on net, 32-4, and won more corner kicks, 30-3. The Americans will have to generate an attack Sunday without Rose Lavelle, who was suspended for the Sweden match after picking up a second yellow card. \u201cYou know, she\u2019s one of the best players in the world and not having her is definitely going to change the way we\u2019re, or at least some of the ways, we can approach the game,\u201d Andonovski said. \u201cBut in same time, we have a great roster with great players on the roster that are here for reasons for moments like this when they\u2019re ready and able to step in at any point in time.\u201d This upset-filled tournament has already seen the shocking early exits of Germany, Brazil and Canada and Morgan said she feels no joy seeing a trio of America's greatest challengers taken off the table. \"It\u2019s crazy tp see teams like Germany, Brazil, Canada, not making it to the knockout stage,\" Morgan said. \"And that just goes to show the growth of this game and and the fact that you know, you still want to continue to stay on top but you have to prove that time and time again you have to be able to show back tomorrow.\" Should the Americans crash out on Sunday, an exit in the round of 16 would mark the U.S. women\u2019s program\u2019s earliest elimination from competitive international play in memory. While winning world titles isn\u2019t a given, even for the dominant United States, the Americans have always come close to the pinnacle even when falling short. All of those American disappointments would pale in comparison to a U.S. elimination on Sunday. \"I think we hold ourselves to a high standard and I think within that the U.S. holds, and in the rest of the world holds, us to a high standard which is valid,\" Morgan said. \"I mean, we have been very successful for decades on this, in this, team. So we hold a high expectation for ourselves and we want to continue to prove ourselves right.\" Susan Archer and Molly Hunter reported from Melbourne and David K. Li from Los Angeles.",

        "content": "While Texas Gov. Greg Abbott places buoys in the Rio Grande to make it harder for migrants to cross into his state, a growing number of migrants have braved record-breaking heat and dangerous terrain to cross into Arizona.  Long considered the most dangerous area to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, the Tucson sector is now also its busiest. On average, more than 1,300 migrants cross daily despite temperatures that regularly top 100 degrees, according to Customs and Border Protection data obtained by NBC News.  \u201cThis is a very rough, rough entrance into the United States,\u201d said Jim Chilton, a rancher in Arivaca, Arizona, who regularly sees migrants cross his 50,000 acres of land.  \u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse,\u201d he said, noting a seemingly undeterred migrant population traversing his ranch. Most of the migrants trying to cross Chilton\u2019s property are single adult men trying to evade detection by Border Patrol. But in other areas, like around Nogales, families with young children are turning themselves in to agents to seek asylum.  NBC News recently traveled with Border Patrol agents in Nogales as they apprehended a group of 20 women and children who had crossed the border early in the morning, when the air was still cool.  One mother traveling with her 16-year-old son said they had been sleeping in the mountains and decided to turn themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol because they were exhausted and had nothing to eat.  The increase in families is especially concerning to Border Patrol agents and rescue workers, given this summer\u2019s temperatures. Agent Ronaldo Rios, the acting director of the Arizona Air Coordination Center, told NBC News he has seen groups crossing with more than 200 women and children, including babies and toddlers.  \u201cThe common hazard that folks are hearing about is going to be the heat,\" said Rios. \"Exposure to the elements \u2014 being out in our terrain or mountainous terrain for long periods of time \u2014 without any water.\u201d John Russell, an air interdiction agent who flies Black Hawk helicopters for Customs and Border Protection\u2019s Air and Marine operations, said that his unit recently received 26 calls for help in a single day. Many migrants who were trying to cross the border in remote terrain called for help during the first storm of southern Arizona\u2019s annual monsoon season.  Calls to 911 \u201cstarted rolling in,\u201d said Russell. \u201cThere were three that we weren\u2019t able to get to due to weather, aircraft availability. One of those was later found deceased. He didn\u2019t make it. He succumbed to the weather.\u201d Department of Homeland Security officials are worried about the overall rise in families crossing the border as well. In Tucson, in particular, the rise in families could mean more migrant deaths.  \"We are seeing very little kids that need water,\u201d said Alejandro Avirde, a border patrol agent. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this hike for five hours, and they\u2019re in need of water.\u201d CORRECTION (Aug. 5, 2023, 12:12 p.m. ET) A previous version of this article misstated John Russell\u2019s title.

        "content": "Sweeping \u201cexit bans\u201d and arbitrary detentions in China are having a chilling effect, among not just the Chinese diaspora with ties to their homeland but also international businesses increasingly anxious about operating there, Western experts and human rights watchdogs say. Under President Xi Jinping\u2019s decadelong rule, China has become more authoritarian by seeking to control many aspects of public life, from internet censorship and rewriting high school textbooks to imposing ideological crackdowns on the music and entertainment industries. The Chinese government rejects these characterizations. But for many people and businesses with links to China, operating there has only become more difficult. Its increased use of so-called exit bans and sweeping new counterespionage laws are creating a hostile environment for foreign business, according to experts. These changes have altered the life of one naturalized American citizen from Shanghai who asked not to be named to protect family and friends still living in China.  Before the pandemic lockdowns, he would travel to Shanghai every two years to visit his family and friends. But post-Covid things started to change, he said, and after a recent State Department advisory against traveling to China, combined with news reports about people being detained for no reason, he now thinks twice before booking a flight. \u201cBefore Covid we used to go there every other year. And every time we went back it changed so much, generally in the right direction. There were more people and the city was getting fancier,\u201d he said. \u201cBut since Covid, there were so many things that happened, especially the lockdown in Shanghai, and the political situation is very different.\u201d  He said he would return in the event of a family emergency but wants to avoid it if at all possible.  \u201cI don\u2019t just want to go back\u201d because officials can \u201cstop you for whatever and you cannot leave,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to be stopped, but there is a possibility and that\u2019s a concern, especially as I have a family here.\u201d It was against this backdrop that the State Department issued its advisory in late June, urging Americans to \u201creconsider travel\u201d to mainland China because of \u201carbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans, and the risk of wrongful detentions.\u201d U.S. citizens of Chinese descent \u201cmay be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment,\u201d the advisory reads, with officials potentially using these bans to pressure the family members of alleged dissidents abroad and gain leverage over foreign governments. Andrew Scobell, a distinguished fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, an independent Washington think tank funded by Congress, said China has \u201creally ratcheted up the intimidation and it\u2019s meant to cow people into silence.\u201d  \u201cBut it will have adverse effects, including intimidating people to the extent that they won\u2019t go back\u201d and \u201cintimidating CEOs and other business leaders,\u201d he added.  Part of the issue is that China does not recognize dual citizenship, creating complications for naturalized Americans of Chinese descent. Beijing believes the global Chinese population have a \u201cshared cultural background, irrespective of their nationality anywhere else\u201d and they \u201cowe a debt of cultural obligation to China,\u201d according to David Lampton, a professor emeritus at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. These people feel \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d to arbitrary action by China, which feels \u201cperfectly unconstrained to do with you what they want \u2014 irrespective of what other nationality documents you may hold,\u201d he said. People with \u201cdual travel documents don\u2019t necessarily know what the rules are,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can think you\u2019re subject to American consular protection and so on but that may in fact not be the case.\u201d This comes as relations between Washington and Beijing continue to cool off, with President Joe Biden characterizing his presidency as a U.S.-led democratic struggle against the autocracies, namely China. He and others want to \u201cde-risk\u201d their relationship with Beijing, in theory continuing lucrative trade but restricting some exports, such as microchips, while retaining the right to criticize China over human rights and other alleged malpractices. China frequently bristles at what it sees as foreign meddling and has denied the allegations made in the travel advisory. \u201cChina welcomes the people and businesses of all countries,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said when asked about it on July 10. \u201cWe are committed to protecting their safety and lawful rights and interests in China in accordance with the law, including their freedom of entry and exit.\u201d On the same day, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a warning to Chinese people in the U.S. \u201cThere have been frequent incidents of gun violence and discrimination against Asians in the United States,\u201d it said. It reminded \u201cChinese citizens in the U.S. to pay close attention to the local social security situation\u201d and \u201cbeware of falling into the tricks and traps of the U.S.\u201d  Human rights watchdogs and independent international analysts say the evidence suggests Beijing\u2019s protestations of innocence are unfounded. Since 2018, Xi\u2019s China has passed or amended five laws authorizing exit bans, bringing the total to 15, according to the Spain-based human rights group Safeguard Defenders. Mentions of exit bans have skyrocketed eightfold in China\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Court database, it said. These bans have been used for years to target Uyghurs, the mostly Muslim ethnic group that Washington and others say Beijing persecutes. But the bans' reach is widening, according to Safeguard Defenders, encompassing relatives of activists and \u201cso-called fugitives\u201d living outside of China, as well as \u201chuman rights defenders, businesspeople, officials and foreigners,\u201d the group said in an April report. These bans are often complex, vague and impossible to appeal, it said. Furthermore, on July 1, China updated its counterespionage law, broadening the definition of spying and banning the transfer of any data the government deems related to national security. Fear is rife within the international business community that this could be used to target anyone indiscriminately. Even before it was updated, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned in April that the law was \u201ca matter of serious concern for the investor community.\u201d It said in a statement that it cast \u201ca wide net over the range of documents, data or materials considered relevant to national security.\u201d This additional scrutiny \u201cdramatically increases the uncertainties and risks\u201d of doing business in China, it added. The reach of Xi\u2019s China does not end at its borders. In April, two people in New York were arrested on charges of operating an illegal Chinese police station, part of what Safeguard Defenders says is a global network to monitor dissidents that stretches to the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands, all of which have opened parallel investigations. China denies this, saying the facilities are volunteer-run sites assisting Chinese nationals with renewing driver\u2019s licenses and other services. This landscape risks mainland China going the way of Hong Kong, which saw an exodus of intellectuals and entrepreneurs when Beijing introduced a new national security law in 2020 that critics said eroded its historical freedoms. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just ideological suppression, it can be a tool in business relations gone sour,\u201d said Lampton at Johns Hopkins. Chinese officials \u201ccould snatch\u201d someone involved in a business deal \u201coff the street and say, \u2018You\u2019re not leaving until we\u2019ve resolved this.\u2019\u201d For the unnamed naturalized American citizen from China, all of this presents an uncertain future, with his homeland subject to the chaotic whims of geopolitics. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to get better, maybe in a year or two,\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends on what happens between the U.S. and China.\u201d",

        "title": "Niger\u2019s junta rulers ask for help from Russia's Wagner mercenary group",
        "content": "Niger\u2019s new military junta has asked for help from the Russian Wagner mercenary group as the deadline nears for it to release the country\u2019s ousted president or face possible military intervention by the West African regional bloc, according to an analyst. The request came during a visit by one of the coup leaders, Gen. Salifou Mody, to neighboring Mali, where he made contact with someone from Wagner, Wassim Nasr, a journalist and senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, told The Associated Press. He said three Malian sources and a French diplomat confirmed the meeting first reported by France 24. \u201cThey need (Wagner) because they will become their guarantee to hold onto power,\u201d he said, adding that the group is considering the request. Niger\u2019s junta faces a Sunday deadline set by the regional bloc known as ECOWAS to release and reinstate the democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum, who has described himself as a hostage. Defense chiefs from ECOWAS members finalized an intervention plan on Friday and urged militaries to ready resources after a mediation team sent to Niger on Thursday wasn\u2019t allowed to enter the city or meet with junta leader Gen. Abdourahmane Tchiani. After his visit to Mali, run by a sympathetic junta, Mody warned against a military intervention, vowing that Niger would do what it takes not to become \u201ca new Libya,\u201d Niger\u2019s state television reported Friday. Niger has been seen as the West\u2019s last reliable counterterrorism partner in a region where coups have been common in recent years. Juntas have been rejecting former colonizer France and turning toward Russia. Wagner operates in a handful of African countries, including Mali, where human rights groups have accused its forces of abuses. One can\u2019t say there\u2019s any direct implication of Russia in Niger\u2019s coup, but \u201cclearly, there\u2019s an opportunistic attitude on the part of Russia, which tries to support destabilization efforts wherever it finds them,\u201d French foreign affairs ministry spokeswoman Anne-Claire Legendre told broadcaster BFM on Friday. Days after Niger\u2019s junta seized power, residents waved Russian flags in the streets. The spokeswoman described Wagner as a \u201crecipe for chaos.\u201d On Saturday, France\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Catherine Colonna, said the regional threat of force was credible and warned the putschists to take it seriously. \u201cCoups are no longer appropriate ... It\u2019s time to put an end to it,\u201d she said. The ministry said France supports \u201cwith firmness and determination\u201d the ECOWAS efforts to make sure the coup leaders fail, and it called for Bazoum and all members of his government to be freed. Niger\u2019s military leaders have been following the playbook of Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso, also run by a junta, but it\u2019s moving faster to consolidate power, Nasr said: \u201c(Tchiani) chose his path, so he\u2019s going full on it without wasting time because there\u2019s international mobilization.\u201d One question is how the international community will react if Wagner is brought in, he said. When Wagner came into Mali at the end of 2021, the French military was ousted shortly afterward after years of partnership. Wagner was later designated a terrorist organization by the United States, and international partners might have a stronger reaction now, Nasr said. And much more is at stake in Niger, where the U.S. and other partners have poured hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance in efforts to combat the region\u2019s growing jihadi threat. France has 1,500 soldiers in Niger, though coup leaders say they have severed security agreements with Paris, and the U.S. has 1,100 military personnel in the country. \u201cAt the moment, there\u2019s no real indication that the (junta) is going to soften its tone or make concessions ahead of the deadline,\u201d said Andrew Lebovich, research fellow with the Clingendael Institute and postdoctoral fellow with the Danish Institute for International Studies, saying an intervention \u201cpotentially serious consequences for Niger and for the region.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what an intervention would look like or when it would begin. Niger\u2019s junta has called on the population to watch for spies, and self-organized defense groups have mobilized at night to monitor cars and patrol the capital. Any intervention is fraught with risk, said a report by the Hudson Institute. \u201cIf the junta were to dig in its heels and rally the populace around the flag \u2014 possibly even arming civilian militias \u2014 the intervention could morph into a multifaceted counterinsurgency that ECOWAS would not be prepared to handle,\u201d it said. While some in Niger are bracing for a fight, others are trying to cope with travel and economic sanctions imposed by ECOWAS after the coup. The sanctions have closed land and air borders with ECOWAS countries and suspended commercial and financial transactions with member states. Residents said the price of goods is rising and there\u2019s limited access to cash. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the consequences of these sanctions, especially their impacts on the supply of essential food products, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, petroleum products and electricity,\u201d said Sita Adamou, president of Niger\u2019s Association to Defend Human Rights.",

Newsom's team Saturday slammed DeSantis' proposed rules for their debate on Fox News. \u201cWhat a joke,\" Newsom spokesman Nathan Click said in a statement in response to the proposal that DeSantis' team sent Fox News host Sean Hannity on Friday. \"Desantis\u2019 counterproposal is littered with crutches to hide his insecurity and ineptitude \u2014 swapping opening statements with a hype video, cutting down the time he needs to be on stage, adding cheat notes and a cheering section,\" Click said. \"Ron should be able to stand on his own two feet. It\u2019s no wonder Trump is kicking his ass.\u201d DeSantis' team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. DeSantis, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination, told Hannity on Wednesday that he would be willing to debate Newsom, a Democrat with whom he has frequently clashed over issues like guns, abortion, education and immigration. \u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m game. Let\u2019s get it done. Just tell me when and where. We\u2019ll do it,\u201d DeSantis said, agreeing to the debate idea that initially came about in June, when Hannity asked Newsom whether he'd debate DeSantis. Newsom sent a formal debate offer letter to Hannity last month that included rules such as that the debate would be moderated by Hannity, be broadcast live and be 90 minutes in length and that both governors wouldn\u2019t use notes. Newsom also proposed Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina as potential locations. In a letter to Hannity dated Friday, DeSantis' team offered its own rules, which diverged from some proposed by Newsom. Some of the differences: Hannity framed the event Wednesday as a \u201cpolicy-based debate\u201d between the heads of a red state and a blue state, but DeSantis has said the debate will be far more than that. \u201cThis is the debate for the future of our country,\" he told Hannity.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 North Korea has offered a very brief response to United Nations officials about an American soldier who dashed over the heavily-guarded border with South Korea last month and was taken into custody, the Pentagon said Tuesday. However, Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said that North Korea only acknowledged the U.N. Command\u2019s request for information about U.S. Army Private Travis King and stopped short of offering detailed information about him. \u201cI can confirm that the DPRK has responded to United Nations Command, but I don\u2019t have any substantial progress to read out,\u201d Ryder told a press conference, using the acronym of North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. When pressed, Ryder said that North Korea\u2019s message back to the U.N. Command was just \u201can acknowledgement\u201d of its inquiry. King sprinted into North Korea on July 18 while on a tour of the Demilitarized Zone on the border, landing the United States in a new diplomatic quandary with nuclear-armed North Korea. King, who joined the U.S. Army in January 2021, had served as a Cavalry Scout with the Korean Rotational Force, part of the decades-old U.S. security commitment to South Korea. But his posting was dogged by legal troubles. He faced two allegations of assault in South Korea, and eventually pleaded guilty to one instance of assault and destroying public property for damaging a police car during a profanity-laced tirade against Koreans, according to court documents. From May 24 to July 10 he served a sentence of hard labor at the Cheonan correctional facility in lieu of paying a fine, Yonhap news agency reported. After his release from the prison, which is designated for U.S. military members and other foreigners, King stayed at a U.S. base in South Korea for a week, Yonhap said. A Cheonan prison official confirmed King had served the hard labor sentence there, but declined to provide further information citing privacy concerns. U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said King had been due to face military disciplinary action on his return home to Fort Bliss, Texas. U.S. officials have expressed deep concern over King\u2019s fate in North Korea. The Army has noted the case of Otto Warmbier, a U.S. college student who was imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months and died shortly after he was returned to the United States in a coma in 2017.",

        "content": "MULTAN, Pakistan \u2014 A train derailed in southern Pakistan on Sunday, killing at least 30 people and injuring at least 60 others, officials said. Rescue operations were underway. Ten cars of a Rawalpindi-bound train derailed and some overturned, near the Pakistani town of Nawabshah, trapping many passengers, said senior railway officer Mahmoodur Rehman Lakho. Local television showed rescue teams extracting women, children and elderly passengers from damaged and overturned cars. Some of the injured were lying on the ground crying for help while locals gave out water and food. AP photos showed derailed train cars sprawled across or near the tracks. Senior police officer Abid Baloch said from the scene of the accident that 30 bodies had been recovered while more than 60 people were injured, some critically. He added that the death toll may rise as rescue operations continue. Baloch said women and children were among the dead and injured. Lakho, who is in charge of railways in the accident area, said rescue crews took injured passengers to the nearby People\u2019s Hospital in Nawabshah. He said the ill-fated Hazara Express was on its way from Karachi to Rawalpindi when 10 cars went off the tracks near the Sarhari railway station off Nawabshah. Mohsin Sayal, another senior railway officer, said train traffic was suspended on the main railway line as repair trains were dispatched to the scene. Sayal said alternative travel arrangements and medical care would be made available for the train\u2019s passengers. Railways Minister Khaja Saad Rafiq said the crash could be due to a mechanical fault or the result of sabotage. He said an investigation was underway. Train crashes often happen on poorly maintained railways tracks in Pakistan, where colonial-era communications and signal systems haven\u2019t been modernized and safety standards are poor.",

        "content": "A white mother who was suspected of trafficking her biracial daughter in October 2021 by Southwest Airlines employees has filed a racial discrimination suit against the company. Mary MacCarthy was traveling to Denver from Los Angeles with her 10-year-old daughter to attend her brother's funeral, she told NBC News nearly two years ago. Upon landing in Denver, MacCarthy and her daughter were confronted by police officers because a flight attendant suspected her of potential human trafficking. A federal lawsuit filed Thursday in the District Court of Colorado accused Southwest Airlines of racial discrimination. MacCarthy accused the airline staff of flagging her as suspicious \"based on a racist assumption about a mixed\u2010race family.\" \"The officers began questioning Ms. MacCarthy and made it clear that they were given the racially charged information that Ms. MacCarthy\u2019s daughter was possibly being trafficked by her simply because Ms. MacCarthy is White and her daughter is Black,\" the lawsuit said. David Lane, the attorney representing MacCarthy, said that the suit is designed to bring accountability and to have the airline re-examine its own training. He said that the use of racial profiling in this case has attempted to address a serious crime with a \"stereotypical, easy formula.\" \"Just as the police are constitutionally not permitted to stop-and-frisk young men of color based upon their race, corporate America is similarly not permitted to resort to such profiling in using law enforcement to stop and question racially diverse families simply based upon their divergent races, which is what Southwest did,\" Lane said in a statement. MacCarthy said that her daughter broke down in tears during the questioning and remains traumatized by the incident almost two years later. In an interview in 2021, MacCarthy said her daughter was \"sobbing\" throughout the encounter. \u201cShe unfortunately already has had charged encounters with police. Any kid\u2019s going to be scared in a situation like this,\u201d MacCarthy said. According to a police report, the flight attendant said she flagged the family as suspicious because they were the last to board the plane and asked other passengers to change seats so they could sit together. The flight attendant didn\u2019t see the mother and daughter speak on the plane and claimed MacCarthy told her daughter not to talk to the flight crew, the report said. MacCarthy denied the claims that she and her daughter didn\u2019t talk on the flight or that she prohibited her daughter from speaking to the flight crew. She also said she was called 10 days after the incident by a human trafficking unit investigator from the Denver Police Department. The incident was closed as \u201cunfounded\u201d with no further action necessary, according to the police report. Southwest Airlines declined to comment on the litigation Sunday. The company said in 2021 that it was conducting a review of the incident, but the airline did not answer questions as to the results of its review on Sunday. The lawsuit demands a jury trial, attorney costs and fees, as well as damages that will be established during trial.",

In May, the man set up a camera in the home, which showed Johnson \"pouring something into his coffee pot,\" according to the complaint, which said he pretended to drink the coffee until the family came back to the U.S. on June 28 because he didn't want to file a report in Germany. While he was temporarily stationed at a hotel on Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Johnson's husband set up another camera, which again showed Johnson \"walk to his coffee maker and pour something into his water reservoir\" on July 5, court documents alleged. The man filed a police report the next day, but officers told him it wasn't clear what Johnson was pouring into his coffee pot, they said. When the family moved to permanent housing on July 7, the man set up more cameras that looked like fire alarms to the ceiling, according to court documents. One was placed in the laundry room, where bleach was kept, another was placed right over the coffee machine, and a third was placed to show walking between the two areas, the documents said. After he collected multiple videos allegedly showing Johnson \"take bleach, pour it into a container and then walk over and pour it into the coffee maker,\" her husband went back to police, court documents say. The man told police he believes his estranged wife was trying to kill him to collect death benefits, police said. Johnson was arrested by Tucson police and charged with attempted first-degree homicide, attempted aggravated assault and adding poison to food or drink. She was being held at the Pima County Adult Detention Center, according to online records. A search with a warrant recovered a container with liquid in it in Johnson's bedroom under her bathroom sink that smelled like bleach, according to court documents, which said liquid inside the coffee maker also smelled like bleach. It wasn't clear whether Johnson has an attorney.",

        "content": "Israeli police said Saturday that they arrested two Israeli settlers after they stormed a Palestinian village in the West Bank in a rampage that left one Palestinian dead. Armed settlers entered Burqa, a herding village east of the city of Ramallah, late Friday, shooting and killing 19-year-old Qusai Matan, Palestinian health officials said. Israeli media reported that one of the arrested settlers, who remained unnamed, used to work as an aide for a lawmaker of the far-right Israeli \u201cJewish Power\u201d party which is in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition of ultranationalist and ultraorthodox parties in the Israeli parliament. It includes Itamar Ben-Gvir, a pro-settlement firebrand known for hardline positions against Palestinians. The party couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Police said they arrested two settlers after detaining five for questioning. The other settler who was arrested was hospitalized after sustaining injuries Friday night. Authorities did not elaborate on the charges. The army said that Israeli settlers arrived in the area to herd sheep, leading to clashes between Israelis and Palestinians from the village. Both sides hurled rocks at each other, the army said, and Israelis fired at Palestinians, leaving Matai dead and four Palestinians and several Israelis injured by rocks. he village was closed down and more Israeli troops were stationed in the area surrounding it. Palestinian officials said the settlers also burned two cars in the village. They also called for the perpetrators to be punished. Violence has spiraled in the northern West Bank with the rise of shooting attacks by Palestinian groups against Israelis and daily arrest raids by the Israeli military, and growing attacks by extremist Jewish settlers. The surge in fighting is one of the worst between Israelis and Palestinians in nearly two decades. More than 150 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the start of 2023 in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Israel says most killed have been militants, but stone-throwing youths protesting army raids and innocent bystanders have also been killed. At least 26 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis so far this year. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. Palestinians seek those territories for their hoped-for independent state.",

        "content": "A Russian \u201cguided air bomb\u201d hit a blood transfusion center in northeast Ukraine Saturday night, killing two people and injuring four, Ukrainian officials said.  \u201cThis war crime alone says everything about Russian aggression,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in Telegram post, alongside a picture of a building engulfed in flames. He said that a \u201cguided air bomb\u201d had hit the blood transfusion center in the northeastern city of Kupiansk. In a separate post on his own Telegram channel, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said initial reports suggested two men had died and another four were injured in the \u201clarge scale fire.\u201d Houses and farm buildings were also damaged, he said, adding that residential housing and other agricultural buildings had also been struck in nearby villages. NBC News could not independently verify the claims, and Russia has repeatedly denied deliberately targeting civilians in what it calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, although Western leaders and Ukraine\u2019s armed forces estimate thousands of people, both military members and civilians, have been killed and that millions more have been displaced.    The city of Kupiansk and its outlying settlements are in Kharkiv, which were seized by Russian troops in the early days of Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  The area was liberated during a Ukrainian counteroffensive in September but has since come under heavy shelling and attacks.  Elsewhere, the Moscow-appointed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said in a Telegram post that the Chongar Bridge, which links the peninsula to the Russian occupied Ukrainian mainland, had been hit with a \u201cmissile strike.\u201d \u201cOne hit, some of the missiles were shot down by air defense forces,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is damage to the roadbed of the automobile bridge, repair work is already beginning. There are no victims.\u201d Farther north, Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-installed mayor of the city of Donetsk said a fire had broken out at the University of Economics and Trade after 40 missiles were fired in its vicinity. Alexei Kostrubitsky, the Russian-installed Donetsk regional emergency minister, told Reuters that Ukrainian forces had used cluster munitions in the shelling, which had caused the fire. NBC News could not verify these claims, but both sides have used cluster munitions over the course of the invasion.  The intense overnight fighting came as officials from 40 different countries, including the U.S. and China, met in Jeddah to begin Ukraine-organized peace talks seeking to find a way to start negotiations over Russia\u2019s war on the country. Ukrainian and Western diplomats hope that the senior officials from countries across both the global North and South will agree on key principles for a future peace settlement to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Russia was not invited. The renewed global push to peace comes as Russia exited a Turkey and U.N.-backed deal in July allowing for the safe export of Ukrainian grain, causing a jump in global food prices.",

        "title": "Green backlash? U.K.\u2019s leader fuels battle over driving \u2014 which could signal a coming climate fight",
        "content": "LONDON \u2014 Posing in a car once owned by conservative icon Margaret Thatcher, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak explained why he was launching a media blitz to burnish his own credentials as a champion of the average voter against what he considers state overreach in the name of the environment. Signaling his opposition to a slate of environmentally-friendly policies, Sunak said on Twitter Sunday that he knows \u201chow important cars are for families to live their lives,\u201d unlike the country\u2019s \u201canti-motorist\u201d opposition Labour Party. Sunak\u2019s embattled Conservative government subsequently announced a review of \u201canti-car\u201d measures aimed at improving air quality and reducing traffic, as well as a massive expansion of oil and gas drilling licenses in Britain\u2019s North Sea. The prime minister claims the U.K. can do all this and still reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But it was a sudden turn in a nation where there has largely been a political consensus over green politics \u2014 and experts told NBC News it may be only the beginning of a broader shift in which right-wing parties view opposition to green policies as an opportunity to win votes. Bolstered by a surprise local election victory last month in which the Conservative Party emphasized its opposition to new charges for drivers in London, Sunak has wooed voters by embracing a protest movement that sees such attempts to restrict car usage as an attack on personal freedoms. The move comes as several European countries face political turmoil over environmental issues. The Netherlands saw the Farmer-Citizen Movement become a leading political party this year, thanks to its fierce opposition to government plans to reduce or shut thousands of farms, while Poland\u2019s right-wing populist government has criticized the European Union\u2019s renewable energy targets, which commit its 27 member states to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030.  \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is once again, as with immigration, a center-right party beginning to take on some of the typical tropes and rhetoric of radical right-wing populist parties, who present themselves very often as the friend of the motorist and say all these environmental concerns are overblown,\u201d said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University in London and an expert on the Conservative Party. On July 21 the Conservatives unexpectedly won a by-election in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, the parliamentary seat in London\u2019s western suburbs that was vacated by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The election became a referendum on ULEZ, the ultra-low emission zone, which charges drivers of older, high-polluting vehicles 12.50 pounds ($16) a day to drive in London\u2019s central boroughs. At the end of August the zone will extend across Greater London \u2014 and suburban residents\u2019 concerns over this gave the Conservatives a much-needed victory.  Some protesters opposing the change are heavily influenced by elaborate right-wing conspiracy theories, and such is the level of disquiet, cameras installed to enforce the scheme have been vandalized or stolen.   London\u2019s mayor, Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan, has nevertheless passionately defended the policy and said it was needed because thousands of people in the capital die each year from air pollution.  The vast majority of cars also won\u2019t pay any emissions charge. But the Uxbridge result sparked wavering on ULEZ from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, eager to avoid any potential wedge issues that could help the Conservatives keep power.  And Sunak\u2019s media blitz comes as many Conservative lawmakers and party members believe environmental policies will cost Britain too much and have only a limited effect, said Bale. \u201cUxbridge has accelerated or amplified those voices and probably, given the government\u2019s in so much trouble on all sorts of other fronts, encouraged the government to weaponize the issue in the hope of mobilizing some of its base,\u201d he said. The Uxbridge win defied political gravity, however.  The Conservatives were soundly beaten in two other by-elections the same day, with Labour taking the seat of Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire, a dramatic and unprecedented reversal from 2019, when a Conservative lawmaker triumphed by 20,000 votes. There could be more to come: Labour leads by about 20% with a year to go until a national election, according to opinion polls.  With an ongoing cost of living crisis dominating voters\u2019 thoughts and most areas of the country untouched by the planned emission zones or similar low-traffic schemes, some analysts have questioned the wisdom of Sunak\u2019s strategy. An opinion poll in May found that 39% of Londoners were in favor of ULEZ, with 35% opposed. Many lawmakers in rural seats backed the prime minister\u2019s stance, though Conservative former Energy Minister Chris Skidmore said the North Sea drilling expansion put Sunak \u201con the wrong side of history.\u201d Protesters from the campaign group Greenpeace took direct action in response to the new North Sea licenses and draped an oil-black covering over Sunak\u2019s home in his North Yorkshire Constituency on Thursday while the family was on holiday in California.  A determination to appeal to a perceived median voter, often seen as a driver, is nothing new in British politics. But this debate \u2014 a perceived trade-off between personal liberty and environmental policy \u2014 is a sign of things to come in politics, according to Neil Lee, a professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics. \u201cI think that environmental policy will rise higher up the agenda as climate change and other environmental impacts become more obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first of these debates where small groups can hold back moves, which I think in our hearts we know we have to make.",

Donell Anderson was taken into custody Friday night in connection with the disappearance and death of Imani Roberson. She was last seen July 16 in Conyers after leaving her mother's house. Her vehicle was later found torched and in pieces in the Atlanta area, about 24 miles away. Images provided by her family to NBC News affiliate WXIA in Atlanta appeared to show charred pieces of her vehicle still littering the site where it was found. And video from a neighbor\u2019s doorbell camera, also provided by her family to WXIA, appeared to show the vehicle pulling out of Roberson\u2019s driveway the evening she went missing. Anderson was arrested at an apartment in Atlanta and charged with felony murder, malice murder, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm, Sheriff Eric Levett said at a news conference. He said there will be more arrests. \"This investigation is still ongoing and I can assure you that another arrest will be made,\" the sheriff told reporters. On the day Roberson went missing, she and her four children had visited her mother for a family dinner. Roberson and two of her children, ages 3 and 1 month, had left to go back home, her family and authorities said. The other two children, 11 and 9, stayed at the grandmother\u2019s house, according to the sheriff. The following day, Roberson's mother, Clarine Andujar-White, called her daughter repeatedly but she did not answer. She went by the home and found no one there, authorities said. Andujar-White filed a missing person\u2019s report on July 17. All four children are safe, authorities said. Andujar-White said it has been a \"very difficult day\" for the family. \"When I couldn\u2019t reach Imani almost three weeks ago, I knew something was wrong,\" she said. \"Late last night my worst fears were confirmed and our family is devastated.\" Roberson's father,  Ronald Acklin, said \"this is not the news we wanted to have.\" \"I said my goodbyes to my daughter yesterday,\" he said through tears. The sheriff's office is still asking anyone with information to come forward. \"Put yourself in the shoes of this family. Put yourself in the shoes of this mother and father who not only just lost a daughter, they lost a daughter that has four children that's young as 1 month old,\" the sheriff said. \"If you have a heart and you know something ... you would call and give us information.\"",

        "title": "Detroit woman sues city after being falsely arrested while 8 months pregnant due to facial recognition technology",
        "content": "A Detroit woman is suing the city and a police detective after she was falsely arrested because of facial recognition technology while she was eight months pregnant, according to court documents. Porcha Woodruff, 32, was getting her two children ready for school on the morning of Feb. 16 when six police officers showed up at her doorstep and presented her with an arrest warrant alleging robbery and carjacking. Woodruff initially believed the officers were joking given her visibly pregnant state. She was arrested. \"Ms. Woodruff later discovered that she was implicated as a suspect through a photo lineup shown to the victim of the robbery and carjacking, following an unreliable facial recognition match,\" court documents say. The robbery victim told police that on Jan. 29 he met a woman whom he had sexual intercourse with. At some point in the day, they went to a BP gas station, where the woman \"interacted with several individuals,\" according to the lawsuit. They then left for another location, where the victim was robbed and carjacked at gunpoint by a man whom the woman had interacted with earlier at the BP gas station. The victim told police his phone was returned to the gas station two days later. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for Eastern Michigan, names Detective LaShauntia Oliver, who was assigned to the case, as a defendant. When Oliver learned that a woman had returned the victim's phone to the gas station, she ran facial technology on the video, which identified her as Woodruff, the lawsuit alleges. \"Detective Oliver stated in detail in her report what she observed in the video footage, and there was no mention of the female suspect being pregnant,\" the lawsuit says. When a man was arrested driving the victim's car on Feb. 2, Oliver failed to show him a picture of Woodruff, according to court documents. The victim was also shown a lineup of potential suspects and identified Woodruff as the woman he was with when he was robbed. Oliver used an eight-year-old picture of Woodruff in the lineup from an arrest in 2015, despite having access to her current driver's license, according to the lawsuit. On the day Woodruff was arrested, she and her fianc\u00e9 urged officers to check the warrant to confirm whether the woman who committed the crime was pregnant, which they refused to do, the lawsuit alleges. Woodruff was charged with robbery and carjacking and released from the Detroit Detention Center at around 7 p.m. on $100,000 personal bond. Her fianc\u00e9 took her to a medical center, where she was diagnosed with a low heart rate due to dehydration and was told she was having contractions from stress related to the incident. On March 6, the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office dropped the case for \"insufficient evidence,\" according to the lawsuit. Detroit Police Chief James E. White said he reviewed the allegations in the lawsuit, which he said are \"very concerning.\" \"We are taking this matter very seriously, but we cannot comment further at this time due to the need for additional investigation,\" he said in a statement. \"We will provide further information once additional facts are obtained and we have a better understanding of the circumstances.\" Oliver did not respond to requests for comment.",

        "content": "LONDONDERRY, N.H. \u2014 The events of Jan. 6 took center stage Friday at Mike Pence\u2019s first campaign event after his former running mate pleaded not guilty to charges that he engaged in criminal conspiracies aimed at overturning the 2020 presidential election. As soon as the former vice president arrived at the American Legion Hall in Londonderry, New Hampshire, he encountered about 10 pro-Trump protesters carrying flags and signs. \u201cThere\u2019s the sellout! There\u2019s the traitor!\u201d they yelled at Pence as he exited his vehicle. \u201cWhy\u2019d you sell out the people?\u201d There was no violence, and Pence did not engage with the supporters of his rival for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. At the town hall, Pence tried to court the protesters. \u201cI know the people in this movement, whether they support me or not, are the best people in this country,\u201d he said as he pointed to the protesters in the corner of the room. In response to a question about the potential for further violence from Trump supporters in the wake of Jan. 6, Pence said he rejected that notion \u201ccategorically.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you there is a lot of passion out there, but I just, I reject your suggestion that that passion is translated into the violence and vandalism of that day,\u201d he said. Pence's role on Jan. 6, when some rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence,\" has been thrust back into the spotlight following Tuesday's indictment of former President Donald Trump. In that document, federal prosecutors said Pence kept \u201ccontemporaneous notes\u201d about meetings and conversations he had with Trump leading up to Jan 6. The indictment also said that the president and a co-conspirator now known to be lawyer John Eastman asked Pence to use his authority as president of the Senate on Jan. 6 to either reject certain states\u2019 electors or send them back to their state legislatures. On Friday night, one town hall participant, Mary Bartel of Windham, asked Pence why he didn't go along with that plan. Pence explained, as he has previously to other skeptical voters, that he did not have the authority to overturn the election. He also told her to write down and look up \u201cArticle Two, Section One, Clause Three\u201d of the Constitution. \u201cI will,\u201d she said.",

        "title": "High-stakes Ohio ballot measure sets the stage for another hostile Senate race",
        "content": "CLEVELAND \u2014 The first battle of Ohio's Senate race \u2014 already awash in hostilities among the three Republicans angling to unseat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in 2024 \u2014 arrives Tuesday with a special election on a hot-button ballot measure. One of the GOP candidates, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, is the highest-profile champion of Issue 1, which would raise the bar for voters to ratify future state constitutional amendments from the 50%-plus-one currently required to 60%. If it passes, the new threshold would apply to a separate November ballot measure that\u2019s aimed at enshrining abortion rights in the state Constitution, making it harder for Democrats to challenge the Republican stranglehold on power in Ohio and highlighting Brown\u2019s lonely, endangered status in an increasingly red state. LaRose\u2019s central role in the ballot measure campaign has emerged as a tension point in the Senate primary. Losing would do little to ease those feelings. He has argued that his two wealthy rivals for the nomination haven\u2019t done enough to support Issue 1. A moderate by reputation who has heavily courted the GOP\u2019s conservative base, LaRose also faces scrutiny \u2014 on the right and the left \u2014 for emphasizing the abortion angle ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote, as well as for what his critics call a divided focus between his political ambitions and the special election he is responsible for administering. \u201cA victory on Tuesday will give LaRose a story to tell donors and some much-needed credibility with the conservative grassroots around the state,\u201d said Scott Guthrie, a veteran of Republican Senate campaigns in Ohio who is not aligned with any of the 2024 candidates. \u201cIf the issue fails, LaRose will have spent the vital early days of his campaign as the face of a losing effort and he will be open to criticism from the already skeptical conservative base.\u201d   Reliable polling on Issue 1 has been scarce. A survey last month by USA Today and Suffolk University found 57% of respondents opposed to Issue 1. Both sides have poured millions of dollars into television advertisements, and Republican leaders in favor of the measure expressed optimism after seeing an uptick in early votes from rural counties. \u201cI don\u2019t really give a darn whether it helps me or hurts me,\u201d LaRose said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ll win this. But even if we don\u2019t, I think it\u2019s better to fight and lose than to not fight at all when it\u2019s a worthwhile cause.\u201d He rang alarm bells last week, though, when his Senate campaign called on business entrepreneur Bernie Moreno and state Sen. Matt Dolan \u2014 the other Republicans seeking the seat \u2014 to each contribute $1 million to the effort in support of Issue 1.  Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians, an MLB team, is already self-funding his Senate bid, while Moreno, a former car dealer, has the wealth to do so. And Moreno, through one of his companies, had already contributed $100,000 to the Protect Women Ohio Fund, which opposes the abortion rights amendment set for the November ballot. Political watchers in the state saw LaRose\u2019s plea as a signal that he was looking to spread the blame in the event of a defeat Tuesday. The rival campaigns dismissed it as a stunt.  \u201cIt\u2019s really sad that days before the monumental Issue 1 vote, Frank is spending his time humiliating himself and attacking fellow Republicans to the mainstream media,\u201d Moreno spokesperson Conor McGuinness said. \u201cWhile too many career politicians only seem to care about getting credit to advance their political careers, the only thing Bernie cares about is doing everything in his power to ensure Issue 1 passes.\u201d LaRose, an Army veteran and longtime politician, said he lacks the means to contribute financially to the cause. He did, however, help raise $1 million for Leadership for Ohio, a nonprofit group that launched ahead of his Senate bid and is now aligned with it. LaRose said he did not urge the group to donate to Issue 1 in the months he was able to coordinate with the group before he became an official candidate, and campaign finance laws prohibited him from doing so. He asserted that he has put in \u201csweat equity\u201d by promoting the measure at almost 70 events.  Moreno and Dolan also have advocated for Issue 1 in their appearances across Ohio.  Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, which supports Issue 1, singled out LaRose and Moreno for praise while expressing frustration that the special election had digressed into Senate race showmanship. \u201cBernie Moreno and Frank LaRose have been pillars during this entire endeavor for Issue 1 from start to finish,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t keep a running ticker of who\u2019s at the most events, but I can assure you that no one is working harder than Frank and Bernie on this. For either of them to start nitpicking each other, I think, is rather unfortunate.\u201d Gonidakis' comments excluded Dolan, who emphasizes fiscal issues and border security while standing out as the only GOP contender who has not endorsed former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 comeback bid. But Dolan\u2019s campaign pointed to multiple events in which the state senator has plugged Issue 1. A senior adviser, Chris Maloney, also said Dolan would \u201cactively oppose\u201d the abortion rights measure in November. \u201cMatt Dolan has stepped up time and again, as a state leader but also in his personal capacity, and we\u2019ve worked together to make sure Issue 1 is successful not just with words and resources, but through hard work,\u201d Gayle Manning, a Republican state representative who has endorsed Dolan, said in a statement provided by his campaign. No matter who the GOP nominee for Senate is next year, Brown can paint him as anti-abortion, a message that could be particularly potent if Issue 1 passes and the November measure fails with a majority short of 60%. With early polls showing LaRose leading the primary field and suggesting he is Brown\u2019s strongest general election opponent, the secretary of state is already the focal point of Democratic attacks in one of the country\u2019s premier Senate races. \u201cNo matter the outcome, LaRose made himself the biggest loser and is now the face of an effort designed to help special interests and silence Ohioans,\u201d said Reeves Oyster, Ohio Democratic Party spokesperson. LaRose also is under scrutiny for how he\u2019s talked about Issue 1 and how his office has administered the special election. Just last year, he characterized August elections as a shady way to pass ballot measures while voters are on summer vacation and paying little attention. (Statewide issues, he has since argued, are different because they generate widespread media coverage.) And Moreno has grumbled about LaRose\u2019s comments at a spring GOP function, at which he described the Issue 1 vote in part as being \u201c100% about keeping a radical pro-abortion amendment\u201d out of the Ohio Constitution. \u201cHe said it\u2019s 100% about abortion, which has screwed up the messaging, because it\u2019s 100% about protecting the Constitution,\u201d Moreno said last month on the Common Sense Ohio podcast.  Moreno added: \u201cI don\u2019t love that it\u2019s being done in August.\u201d More recent problems include a scramble to secure enough poll workers before Tuesday\u2019s vote and an email to voters from LaRose\u2019s office last week that gave the wrong date for the special election. Critics wonder if LaRose is distracted or spread too thin. He announced his Senate campaign three weeks ago, right as the Issue 1 homestretch began. LaRose rejects the insinuation.  \u201cThose are political attacks by people with a political motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that we\u2019ve run the secretary of state\u2019s office very well. I am personally somebody with a very high level of attention to detail.\u201d Ryan Stubenrauch, a veteran of Republican Gov. Mike DeWine\u2019s campaigns in Ohio, said he is skeptical that LaRose\u2019s campaign would be irreparably damaged by an Issue 1 loss. But he acknowledged the tricky politics of it.  \u201cThere\u2019s always a risk when you\u2019re running statewide to take some position, especially on a statewide issue,\u201d Stubenrauch said. \u201cIf it wins, he\u2019s counting on getting a lot of credit. And if it loses, he\u2019s hoping it\u2019s not squarely on him.\u201d",

        "title": "The heaviest animal ever? Ancient whale found in Peru desert",
        "content": "A giant whale that lived almost 40 million years ago is now thought to be the heaviest animal that has ever lived, scientists said Wednesday. The Perucetus colossus \u2014 meaning the colossal whale from Peru \u2014was even bigger than the current heavyweight champion, the blue whale, according to an article published in the journal \u201cNature.\u201d The newly revealed findings were based on fossils found in the Peruvian desert more than 10 years ago, but only just identified as a previously unknown species. At 66 feet in length, the colossus isn\u2019t the biggest or longest creature to have lived in the seas, since blue whales can grow to a gargantuan 100 feet long. But the newly discovered sea mammal\u2019s sheer bulk and its bone density means it was probably the heaviest and could have weighed between 94 tons (85 metric tons) and 375 tons (340 metric tons), the study said. The biggest blue whales ever observed weigh an estimated 200 tons (180 metric tons). \u201cThe estimated skeletal mass of P. colossus exceeds that of any known mammal or aquatic vertebrate,\u201d the journal article said, adding that this makes it \u201ca contender for the title of heaviest animal on record.\u201d \u201cThe body mass of this ancient cetacean may have been ... almost twice that of the largest blue whales and more than three times that estimated for Argentinosaurus, one of the largest dinosaurs ever found,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Giovanni Bianucci, from the University of Pisa in Italy, in a press release. An international team of scientists spent years digging in the Ica desert along the southern coast of Peru, an area that was once underwater and is famed for its paleontological discoveries. Eventually they uncovered and extracted 13 vertebrae, four ribs and a hip bone. Each vertebrae would have weighed more than 220 pounds. This posed quite a challenge for the research team, who struggled not only to lift the bone fossils but to fully analyze them via the usual methods. Instead they used pioneering structured light scanning to make a three-dimensional model of them and drilled inside. This allowed them to estimate the whale's size and weight despite having an incomplete skeleton. Dating of volcanic ash at the site means the team could date the species to between 39.8 and 37.84 million years ago, in the Eocene epoch. At that point other members of the cetacean family \u2014 which includes dolphins and whales \u2014 were still \u201cabandoning the terrestrial lifestyle in favor of a marine one,\u201d said Elisa Malinverno, a member of the research team. The Perucetus colossus may have used its heavy skeleton as a ballast to roam around the ocean floor, feeding along the seabed like modern-day sea cows and some sharks, the study said. \u201cIt\u2019s just exciting to see such a giant animal that\u2019s so different from anything we know,\u201d said Hans Thewissen, a paleontologist at Northeast Ohio Medical University who had no role in the research, according to the Associated Press. The Ica desert, one of the driest places on Earth, is also where scientists found the oldest known four-legged cetacean to reach the Pacific Ocean and the earliest ancestor of the modern baleen whales.",

        "content": "A lawsuit involving two former Donda Academy teachers who sued Ye for what they said was wrongful termination from his now-shuttered private Christian school is scheduled for an April 2025 trial. Cecilia Hailey and Chekarey Byers brought the civil lawsuit against Ye, formally known as Kanye West, in April. The suit painted a bizarre picture of the Simi Valley school: students who were served only sushi for lunch and had to sit on the floor to eat, doors locked from the outside, and classes being held only on the first floor because the rapper was \"afraid of stairs.\" Hailey and Byers, who are mother and daughter, also alleged in the lawsuit that they were victims of racial discrimination by the rapper and were fired in retaliation for reporting code violations. The women are Black. Ye as well as Hailey and Byers had sought a jury trial, according to a court filing on Friday. The other defendants in the suit, including Donda Academy, did not demand a jury trial. It is scheduled for April 9, 2025, at a Los Angeles courthouse, the filing states. Representatives for the rapper could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday. Attorney Ron Zambrano, who is representing the women, said they are \"looking forward to our day in court if this can\u2019t be worked out in mediation with Ye and the other defendants acknowledging wrongdoing.\" \"Through his attorneys, Ye has told the judge of his willingness to engage in good faith negotiations,\" he continued. \"While we are hopeful this will resolve the matter with an admission to the allegations against him, we stand by everything in the complaint and aim to hold the defendants accountable for this reprehensible and illegal behavior, no matter their celebrity status.\" Zambrano previously said that the lawsuit showed that the rapper \"is clearly as bad at running a school as he is at managing his own personal and professional life.\" Zambrano accused Ye of enabling an illegal and unsafe school environment \"that also discriminated against the plaintiffs based on their race.\" The lawsuit described how forks and other utensils were barred from the school, students had to sit on the floor during lunch, were fed only sushi, and lunch and recess were held indoors at the same time. It alleged that no cleaning services or school nurses were employed, medications on campus either were unsecured or had expired, and that crossword puzzles were not allowed. There was to be no jewelry, no color or artwork on the walls, and students had to wear all black and dress only in clothing issued or designed by the rapper, according to the suit. Nike and Adidas were \"forbidden,\" it said. Classes were held on the first floor because \"he was reportedly afraid of stairs,\" the suit said. Byers said in a previous statement that she was disappointed and had considered working at the school a \"huge honor and privilege.\" \"I\u2019m extremely sad about all of this,\" she said. \"I\u2019m a huge Kanye fan. His first album was the first I ever purchased.\" Byers said Ye's vision for the school looked \"great on paper\" but in reality, it was \"pure chaos and mutiny.\" \"It\u2019s like a mental hospital being run by the patients,\" she said in her statement. A third former teacher, Timanii Meeks, also sued the rapper and school, alleging wrongful termination. Meeks said she had alerted administrators to exposed electrical wiring in the building and other safety hazards as well as issues with bullying, according to an amended complaint. She was allegedly told that the school was \"working on the kinks.\" She alleged that a few parents had sat in on her class and complained that there were no books, textbooks or educational materials, the suit said. The students were eventually given printouts of online worksheets and workbooks, but she was reprimanded because of the complaints, according to the lawsuit. Meeks was later informed on Oct. 12 by the staffing agency that placed her at Donda Academy that the school did not want her to teach there, the suit stated. She said she was supposed to continue working at the school until at least the end of the year and no reason was given for her firing. She is being represented by the same employment law firm as Hailey and Byers. Donda Academy announced in October that it was closing amid fallout from antisemitic comments Ye made, however, records from California\u2019s Education Department showed Saturday that the school is still active.",

        "content": "Actor Paul Reubens, who came to fame in the 1980s as children's TV star Pee-wee Herman, has died years after a cancer diagnosis, his team said Monday. He was 70. \"Last night we said farewell to Paul Reubens, an iconic American actor, comedian, writer and producer whose beloved character Pee-wee Herman delighted generations of children and adults with his positivity, whimsy and belief in the importance of kindness,\" according to a statement posted to his Facebook. \"Paul bravely and privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit. A gifted and prolific talent, he will forever live in the comedy pantheon and in our hearts as a treasured friend and man of remarkable character and generosity of spirit.\" It had not been previously disclosed that Reubens was diagnosed with cancer. The announcement of his death included a personal statement from the actor, explaining why he had kept his medical condition under wraps. \u201cPlease accept my apology for not going public with what I\u2019ve been facing the last six years,\" he wrote. \"I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you.\u201d Reubens rocketed to fame for creating the sarcastic but good-natured man-child Pee-wee Herman, a character whose red bowtie and sneering catch phrases \u2014 \u201cI know you are, but what am I?\u201d \u2014 were ubiquitous in the \u201880s and early \u201890s. Pee-wee was the star of a Los Angeles stage play produced by Reubens that gained enough of a following that HBO recorded and broadcast a performance in 1981.  That eventually led to Reubens\u2019 big break, the 1985 movie \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure,\u201d helmed by first-time feature film director Tim Burton. The movie followed Pee-wee\u2019s surreal and slapstick journey to find his missing bicycle and, while a modest box office hit, became a cult favorite. The success of \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure\u201d led to Reubens landing a Saturday morning CBS show, \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d The live action show was a hit with kids and adults alike and ran from 1986 to 1991. But Reubens' rise to fame was halted in 1991 after he pleaded no contest to indecent exposure at an adult movie theater in Sarasota, Florida. Then in 2004, Reubens was sentenced to three years probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor obscenity charge involving photographs of minors engaged in sexual conduct that were seized from him. Those brushes with the law dented but didn't derail Reubens' career. He returned to the big screen following the indecent exposure incident with a cameo as the Penguin's father in Burton's 1992 blockbuster sequel, \"Batman Returns.\" That same year, he fully shed his Pee-wee persona by playing a snarling blood-sucker in the \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" film. Reubens won critical acclaim in 2001 for playing a drug-dealing hairdresser in the movie \"Blow,\" starring alongside Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp. His TV credits included appearances on \"30 Rock,\" \"The Blacklist\" and \"Gotham.\" The Groundlings improv and sketch comedy theatre, where Reubens got his start as a performer and invented his iconic alter ego, said in a statement on Monday it was deeply saddened by his passing. \"As an iconic member of The Groundlings in the 1970-80s, Paul created his infamous character of Peewee Herman here, which became a cultural phenomenon that spanned decades,\" the theater said. \u201cPaul\u2019s contributions to comedy and entertainment have left a lasting impact on the world, and he will be greatly missed by all in the Groundlings community. We love you, Paul.\u201d  \"Paul Reubens was like no one else \u2014 a brilliant and original comedian who made kids and their parents laugh at the same time,\" late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel said in a statement. \"He never forgot a birthday and shared his genuine delight for silliness with everyone he met. My family and I will miss him.\" Comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien recalled \"the magic, generosity, artistry, and devout silliness of Paul Reubens.\" \"Everyone I know received countless nonsensical memes from Paul on their birthday, and I mean EVERYONE,\" O'Brien said in a statement. \"His surreal comedy and unrelenting kindness were a gift to us all. Damn, this hurts.\" \"Orange Is the New Black\" and \"Poker Face\" star Natasha Lyonne credited Reubens with launching her career, thanks to a recurring role on \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\" when she was a child actor. \"Love you so much, Paul,\" Lyonne wrote on social media. \"One in all time. Thank you for my career & your forever friendship all these years & for teaching us what a true original is.\"",

        "title": "Donald Trump says he will ask the Judge to step aside",
        "content": "Donald Trump has said he will ask the judge in his alleged election fraud case to step aside on what he called \"very powerful grounds\". He claimed that \"there is no way I can get a fair trial\" unless he has a different judge. His call came after the prosecution requested a court order that would limit what he can publicly say about the case. The judge, Tanya Chutkan, was appointed by former President Barack Obama. Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Sunday morning, describing the case as \"the ridiculous freedom of speech/fair elections case\" and saying that his legal team would immediately be asking for recusal of the judge. He gave no details of his grounds for asking her to step down. Judge Chutkan, appointed in 2014, previously ruled against Mr Trump's efforts to shield evidence from the House January 6 Committee. She is also the only federal judge in Washington who has delivered sentences against defendants in cases related to the 6 January Capitol riot that are longer than the sentences that the DOJ asked for, according to NBC News. Under US federal law, any judge of the United States must disqualify themselves in any proceeding in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Recusal of the judge was not the only thing Mr Trump said he would request. He also said he wanted a \"venue change\" and for his case to be moved out of Washington. He previously said there would be \"no way I can get a fair trial, or even close to a fair trial, in Washington\", which he describes as \"anti-Trump\", and has previously described the Department of Justice as \"highly partisan and very corrupt\". Mr Trump's lawyer, John Lauro, said on Sunday that the former president \"believed in his heart of hearts\" that he had won the 2020 election - and that prosecutors will not be able to prove that Mr Trump did not believe this. Speaking to US TV networks, Mr Lauro said Mr Trump was being attacked for exercising his constitutional First Amendment right to free speech. Earlier this week, Mr Trump wrote in capital letters, \"If you go after me, I am coming after you!\" on Truth Social, just a day after he pleaded not guilty to four charges in the alleged election fraud case. And the same night, the prosecutors said they feared there was a chance Mr Trump might disclose confidential evidence and asked for a protective order to prevent \"the improper dissemination or use of discovery materials, including to the public\". Judge Tanya Chutkan gave Mr Trump's legal team until 17:00 local time on Monday to respond to the submission. Mr Trump's lawyers asked for three more days, but the judge denied their request. Judge Chutkan, a noted hardliner on cases against those accused of participation in the Capitol riots, is expected to call in attorneys from both sides on 28 August to discuss setting a trial date. The charges - which include conspiracy to defraud the US, tampering with a witness and conspiracy against the rights of citizens - stem from the former president's actions in the wake of the 2020 election, including around the 6 January Capitol riot. Over the past two years, the 61-year-old judge has won a reputation for harsh sentences for those convicted of participation in the riots. Of the 31 defendants who have come before her, Judge Chutkan has sentenced every one of them to at least some jail time, according to a Washington Post tally. Mr Trump now faces five upcoming trials - three criminal trials which include the classified documents case, the hush money case, and these election charges; and two civil trials over business practices and alleged defamation of a woman who accused him of rape.",

        "title": "'We can't win forever': Fans react as US World Cup reign ends",
        "content": "\"Frankly we're confused,\" one stunned USA fan told me as I turned to her after the final whistle. She was wearing red, blue and white with stars and stripes from head to toe - at that moment she and probably thousands of others were dumbfounded by what just happened. On the big screen in front of us, the Swedish team were jumping and running across the pitch in absolute joy. Meanwhile, the USA squad and their fans in the Melbourne stadium - and in the Sydney fan zone where I was - were trying to understand. It wasn't just that they were eliminated - it was how they were eliminated that added insult (and confusion) to injury. It came down to penalties. It was neck-and-neck until the last penalty kick by Sweden, which crossed the line by the smallest of margins to deliver one of the biggest stories in a Women's World Cup that has been defined by its upsets and its unpredictability. You can't overstate the enormity of this for the US side and the fans. This is a team that has dominated the women's game internationally for years - an achievement that has earned them a fearsome aura. The reigning champions had come to this World Cup to defend this title but have barely scraped through the group stages and have been knocked out before the quarter finals. What's painfully ironic is that this is the best game they played in the tournament so far. \"It was a lot more fun to watch them today than it was to watch at any of the group stages games,\" Anne Tobin told me. Throughout the match, the US side was dominant. They kept pressing and looked threatening - and yet their performance did not translate to goals. Sweden's defence and their goalkeeper Ze\u0107ira Mu\u0161ovi\u0107, who was named Player of the Match and made some of the best saves in this tournament, were in the way. The disappointment was palpable. Some fans had their hands on their heads, others were in tears, and even those who kept smiling acknowledged the sting of the defeat. \"We can't win forever,\" Erin O'Leary told me. \"This was a hard-fought game. I really think we did a lot better than the group stages,\" she added. But this really hurts for the US. It wasn't just the fans. Many of the players were in tears - including veterans Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, who missed her penalty kick in the shootout. It was a painful note for her to end on in her last ever World Cup. But the team has been unconvincing from the beginning of the tournament. There are several reasons why this will go down as one of their worst World Cups to date: The absence of key players due to injury and the generational differences within the squad made the team feel at times very incoherent and messy. Most crucially, this is a tougher terrain now. Teams have become more competitive and less intimidated by big teams. \"Germany is out. Brazil is out,\" Ms O'Leary said of the two power houses which were also eliminated. There will be many questions asked about the future of this team, including how they move on from this, how they start rebuilding, and whether the head coach, Vlatko Andonovski, should stay on. The former champions and their fans will have to come to terms with the fact that their World Cup dominance and their formidable reign have come to an end - at least for now.",

        "title": "Niger coup: Junta shuts airspace citing military intervention threat",
        "content": "Niger's coup leaders have closed the country's airspace until further notice, citing the threat of military intervention from their neighbours. Flight tracking website Flightradar24 is showing that there are currently no aircraft in Niger's skies. The West African group of countries, Ecowas, had earlier warned it could use force if President Mohamed Bazoum was not reinstated by 23:00 GMT on Sunday. A junta spokesman says Niger's armed forces are ready to defend the country. Mr Bazoum was detained on 26 July, and Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, commander of the presidential guard, later proclaimed himself the new leader. The military takeover has been internationally condemned, including by former colonial power France and the rest of the European Union, as well as the United Nations and the United States. Reading a statement on national television on Sunday, the representative from Niger's junta said they had information that \"a foreign power\" was preparing to attack Niger. After a crisis meeting in Nigeria, Ecowas military chiefs said on Friday they had drawn up a detailed plan for the possible use of force. \"All the elements that will go into any eventual intervention have been worked out here, including the resources needed, the how and when we are going deploy the force,\" said Abdel-Fatau Musah, Ecowas commissioner for political affairs, peace and security. And he added: \"We want diplomacy to work, and we want this message clearly transmitted to them [Niger's junta] that we are giving them every opportunity to reverse what they have done\". They issued their ultimatum a week ago, demanding the generals relinquish power by midnight local time, which has now passed. Ecowas is a regional trading bloc of 15 West African countries, including Nigeria, Senegal, Togo and Ghana. The coup leaders seem to be showing no sign of willingness to cede power, and on Sunday thousands of their supporters rallied defiantly at a stadium in Niger's capital Niamey. Two of Niger's neighbours - Burkina Faso and Mali - earlier warned they would treat any outside military intervention in Niger as \"a declaration of war\" against them. Burkina Faso and Mali are both Ecowas members but have been suspended from the bloc since being ruled by military juntas. Niger is a significant uranium producer - a fuel that is vital for nuclear power - and under Mr Bazoum was a key Western ally in the fight against Islamist militants in West Africa's Sahel region. Where is Niger? It's a vast country in West Africa, and one of the poorest countries in the world. Why was there a coup? The military said it seized power because of insecurity and the economic situation, but there have been suggestions it came after reports the coup leader was about to be sacked. What next? It's feared the military may seek to switch allegiance to Russia and close French and US bases there; for their part, Niger's neighbours have threatened to use force to end the coup.",

        "title": "Niger coup: Ecowas deadline sparks anxiety in northern Nigeria",
        "content": "Niger's military junta has just hours to restore ousted President Mohamed Bazoum to power or face the possibility of military action from the regional bloc Ecowas. Last Sunday, West African leaders gave the coup leaders a week to comply with its demands or it would \"take all measures\u2026 [which] may include the use of force\". But in Niger's neighbour, Nigeria - where the bulk of the troops are likely to come from - voices against the involvement of the military are growing louder. The two countries also have close ethnic and historical ties. On Saturday, Nigeria's senate urged the government to look at \"political and diplomatic options\". And in the northern Nigerian city of Sokoto, bordering Niger, which is home to the army's 8 Division, the anxiety is increasing. It sits on a major junction on the road leading to Niger and is likely to be a mustering point for troops before any military action. The serenity of Sokoto's residential neighbourhoods belies the heightened tension in the city and the wider north-western state. One aspect feeding this is that - according to locals - one in every five residents in Sokoto is from Niger or has connections with the country. Sokoto city's sprawling suburb of Sabon-Gari Girafshi is predominantly inhabited by people from Niger. They fear that military intervention by Ecowas could greatly affect their family members and even jeopardise their own security here in Nigeria. Fifty-one-year-old jewellery maker Sulaiman Ibrahim lives in one of the fenced and gated compounds. One of his wives and some of his children are in Niger's capital, Niamey, trapped there because of last month's coup. \"Now I want to call my wife Fatima to hear from her, because since the day of that coup, I have not heard from her,\" he tells the BBC, gripping his phone in his left hand. He scrolls through his contacts and dials the wife's number again. Each call returns with the same message: \"The number you are calling is not available at this time.\" \"Every time I called, this is what they're telling me, either no service or whatever, I don't know,\" he says in anguish, unable to hide his concern. \"If military action is going to be taken on Niger, this will bring more anxiety. I'm in terrible situation because my family is not with me and I don't have any information about them.\" He opens the photo app on his phone to show his 18-year-old son and one of his siblings. \"Here is my son Mustapha, he's currently in Niger. This is his younger brother, he's six years old, they're with their mother.\" Sulaiman is not alone. Daily he meets with other neighbours from Niger to check if anyone has got news from home. Mohamdu Ousman 43, echoed the sentiments of many here that the use of force to restore the ousted president in Niamey could be catastrophic. \"For Ecowas to go to Niger with the intention to take back power from the military to civilians, we don't wish for that, God forbid. It's like erasing our history,\" he told the BBC. Zainab Saidu, 59, hails from the Nigerien city of Dosso, but has lived most of her life in Sokoto after getting married to a Nigerian man. Her youngest son is currently in Niger and she fears for his safety. \"I'm disturbed, I swear we're in fear all of us, everyone who is from Niger. Everybody is terrified most especially when we heard that Nigeria [might] go to Niger for a war purpose,\" she says. On Friday, West African military chiefs said they had agreed a plan for possible military intervention, but Ecowas continues to push for a diplomatic solution. In an effort to apply other pressure, the regional bloc has also imposed sanctions on the coup leaders and closed the borders into Niger. In addition, Nigeria has cut electricity supplies to its northern neighbour. But this has meant that those on the Nigerian side of the border are also affected. One border town that is feeling the impact is Illela, about 80km (50 miles) from Sokoto city. It's a commercial hub, but is currently wearing the look of a community under economic stress. At its entrance, there are long lines of stranded vehicles, mainly large lorries with their loads covered with tarpaulin to shelter them from the rain and the sun. Gathered in the shade of the lorries are drivers either sleeping or sitting with their phones or radios, waiting for news of the latest developments about the border. One of the drivers, Abdullahi, dressed in a T-shirt and faded blue jeans, is holding a sachet of water. \"I have been stranded here for the past three days,\" he says. \"I have exhausted myself financially. Now I don't have any money. A friend bought food for me this morning. That's why you see me holding the water. I have been calling my boss to explain my plight and to let me know that the border closure has affected me, but he's not responding to my calls.\" His colleagues also look tired and resigned. They could face a long wait and the goods that they are carrying could perish, costing the business owners huge sums of money. Others whose businesses have been seriously hit include Ado Garba Dankwaseri. The 42-year-old often travels into Niger to buy ice blocks to supply to traders in Illela selling water and soft drinks who need to keep things cool. But Ado Garba's business has been hit hard and he is unable to make the trips to Niger for his supplies. \"I make 100,000 naira ($130; \u00a3100) a day with my supplies. But right now, I cannot cross the border. There are soldiers, police and custom and immigration officers stationed everywhere. You cross the border at your own peril,\" the ice trader says. Customs officials met some of the business people in Illela on Friday to try to address their concerns and talk about why the closure was necessary. \"There's no sacrifice too big as long as they are able to achieve peace and democracy within the sub-region. The community understands the reason behind the border closure,\" says Bashir Adewale Adeniyi from the customs service. But the patience of people in Illela and elsewhere in Sokoto is being tested - and so far, there has been little obvious sign that Niger's coup leaders are willing to back down.",

        "title": "Cambodia: PM's son Hun Manet appointed next ruler in royal formality",
        "content": "The eldest son of Cambodia's long-term ruler has been endorsed as the country's next premier in a formality confirming the transition of power. On Monday, Cambodia's king issued a decree stating Hun Manet will succeed Hun Sen, who has ruled for 38 years. Hun Sen announced he would step down just days after the 23 July election, which critics said was not democratic. His party won all but five seats in parliament, after the main opposition was barred from the vote. King Norodom Sihamoni issued the royal decree after Hun Sen sent a letter requesting the official note. His appointment still needs to be confirmed by parliament on 22 August, but it is expected to sail through a National Assembly where 120 of 125 seats are controlled by Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party. Hun Manet, 45, who until recently was the commander of the Royal Cambodian Army, has long been groomed for the leadership role. His father first flagged a transition in 2021, but until July it was unclear when the handover would occur. However Hun Sen announced that he would step down just three days after the election. He is one of the world's longest-serving leaders, having ruled the Southeast Asian nation of 16 million people for nearly four decades. He said at the time he was resigning to ensure stability in Cambodia. However, Hun Sen said he would retain leadership of the ruling Cambodian People's Party - a position political analysts say still gives him ultimate control. Since he came to power following the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime four decades ago, Hun Sen's rule has become increasingly authoritarian, dismantling opponents by jailing or exiling them. On the weekend, in addition to marking his 71st birthday, Hun Sen confirmed the party's landslide victory in the July election - polls which the US, EU and other Western nations have said was neither free nor fair. The outgoing leader on Saturday also confirmed Hun Manet's election as an MP for Phnom Penh, removing the remaining procedural obstacle for his ascent to power. Hun Manet celebrated the result by posting a photo to Instagram showing his son presenting a bouquet of flowers to Hun Sen with the caption: \"Happy birthday to respected and beloved father.\"",

        "title": "Mother and baby dead, 30 missing after migrant boats sink off Italian coast",
        "content": "At least two people have died and more than 30 are believed to be missing after two ships carrying migrants sank off the Italian island of Lampedusa. The two boats reportedly left from the Tunisian port city of Sfax carrying 48 and 42 people, respectively. Italian coastguards said they had recovered the bodies of an Ivory Coast woman and her one-year-old baby. Separately, Tunisian officials said they found the bodies of 10 migrants on a beach near Sfax. The 10 people were found between Friday and Saturday during a windstorm that may have sunken their boat, the official told AFP news agency. Tunisian authorities say the port city is a popular gateway for migrants seeking a better life. Officials in Sfax - which is only about 80 miles (130km) from Italy's Lampedusa island - said they were working to identify the nationalities of the migrants, but they mostly came from sub-Saharan African countries. Italian authorities said they were investigating the incidents. Italy's coastguard said it had rescued 57 migrants when the vessels sank on Saturday, about 23 nautical miles (46 km) south-west of Lampedusa. Earlier, the UN's migration agency, the International Organization for Migration, said more than 30 people had been reported missing. The tragedies follows June's Greek boat disaster which left at least 78 dead and hundreds missing. On Sunday, firefighters and mountain rescue teams were preparing to rescue 20 migrants trapped on a rocky part of Lampedusa's coastline. The migrants have been there since late Friday after strong winds pushed the boats against the rocks. After more than two days of sailing in bad weather, NGO Open Arms said it had started disembarking 195 rescued migrants in the southern Italian port of Brindisi. Police chief Emanuele Ricifari, who is in charge of the investigation, told local media the traffickers would have known that rough seas were forecast. \"Whoever allowed them, or forced them, to leave with this sea is an unscrupulous criminal lunatic,\" Mr Ricifari said. In recent days, Italian patrol boats and charity groups have rescued another 2,000 people who have arrived on the island. The Red Cross has provided some of the migrants with food, water, clothes and emergency thermal blankets. But the coastguard has said bad weather and the poor quality of the boats continue to hinder the rescue operations. In some instances, the engines are stolen from the boats at sea, so that traffickers can reuse them. Mr Ricifari, urging the traffickers to stop, said: \"Rough seas are forecast for the next few days. Let's hope they stop. It's sending them to slaughter with this sea.\" NGOs say Italy's far-right government has made their task more difficult by passing laws that have the effect of forcing rescue ships to use faraway ports. Charities have warned that this increases their navigation costs and reduces the amount of time ships can patrol the areas of the Mediterranean where such disasters are common. The Italian interior ministry said migration figures by sea had doubled this year to 92,000, compared with 42,600 recorded in the same period in 2022. Since March this year, crossing attempts from Sfax to Lampedusa have increased after Tunisian President Kais Saied accused sub-Saharan migrants of trying to change the nature of Tunisian society. More than 1,800 people have lost their lives in the Central Mediterranean crossing from North Africa to Europe - thought to be the world's deadliest. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said the actual figures were likely to be much higher. \"Lots of bodies are being found at sea, suggesting there are many shipwrecks we never hear about,\" said IOM spokesman Flavio Di Giacomo.",

        "content": "A Russian \"guided bomb\" has hit a blood transfusion centre in north-eastern Ukraine, killing two people and injuring four, Ukrainian officials say. Volodymyr Zelensky posted an image of the building on fire as a result of Saturday night's attack around Kupiansk, in the Kharkiv region. \"This war crime alone says everything about Russian aggression,\" he said. Russia has not commented. It has previously denied all allegations of targeting civilians - or war crimes. The city of Kupiansk and nearby settlements were seized by Russian troops in the first few days of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022. The area was liberated during a Ukrainian counter-offensive last September, but comes under missiles and shelling daily. In a post on social media, Mr Zelensky described the perpetrators as \"beasts\". \"Defeating terrorists is a matter of honour for everyone who values life,\" he added. Mr Zelensky did not give details of the casualties. But local officials later posted the same image adding details about the attack on what they described as a non-residential building. President Zelensky also said that on Saturday Russia separately carried out a missile attack, targeting an aeronautical company run by group Motor Sich in the western Khmelnytskyi region. On Sunday, Russia's air defences destroyed a drone as it approached Moscow, the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said. Last week, an office block on a Moscow skyscraper was hit two days in a row by Ukrainian drones, Russian authorities said. Ukraine has not publicly admitted carrying out such attacks. Moscow has also accused Ukraine on Saturday of hitting a Russian tanker with 11 crew members in the Black Sea - the second such sea drone attack in as many days. Russian maritime officials said the engine room of the Sig tanker was damaged in the attack in the Kerch Strait. No-one was injured. The Kerch Strait connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, separating Crimea - Ukraine's peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014 - and Russia's Taman peninsula. Ukraine has not publicly commented. But a Ukrainian security service source told the BBC a sea drone had been used. In another development, the Chonhar road bridge linking mainland Ukraine to Crimea was hit by a Ukrainian missile strike on Sunday, according to Russia's RIA news agency. This is the second time Ukrainian missiles have hit the bridge after an earlier attack in June forced it to close for repairs. Moscow-installed Kherson regional governor Vladimir Saldo wrote on Telegram that another small bridge, connecting the port city of Henichesk and the narrow Arabat Spit on Crimea's north-east coast, had been shelled. A civilian driver was hurt and a gas pipeline was damaged, leaving 20,000 people without gas.",

        "title": "How Barbie Took Over the World",
        "content": "You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking only one movie is coming out this year. It\u2019s Barbie\u2019s world, and we\u2019re just living in it. Perhaps we should have anticipated the Barbie craze. After all, more than a billion dolls have been sold worldwide since Barbie\u2019s debut in 1959. Barbie is 64 years old, and yet this is the first time she\u2019ll star in a live-action movie on the big screen. A Barbie movie has been in the works since at least 2009, but versions with stars like Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer stalled in part because Mattel was nervous about attaching a face and a personality to the doll. Barbie has no inner life on purpose; children are supposed to project their hopes and dreams onto her blank canvas. Now, director Greta Gerwig is finally bringing not just one but several Barbies to the big screen\u2014many of whom are featured on a recent cover of this magazine. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about how the Barbie movie came to be and the frenzy around its opening, from the star-studded soundtrack to Margot Robbie\u2019s red carpet looks to how the movie\u2019s rivalry with Oppenheimer came to dominate social media. \u2014Eliana Dockterman The marketing may be inescapable, but Warner Bros. has done a good job of keeping the plot of Barbie under wraps. We\u2019ve seen the movie, and here\u2019s what we can reveal: The film is set in Barbie Land, a utopia where each Barbie has an equally impressive job, ranging from diplomat to scientist to Supreme Court Justice. As Helen Mirren\u2019s narrator wryly tells us, \u201call problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved.\u201d The Barbies have sleepovers every night during which they declare how beautiful and confident they feel. The Kens exist as convenient dance partners. But then Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie begins to think about mortality. Looking for answers, she ventures into the real world with Ryan Gosling\u2019s Ken, who has been feeling like a mere accessory in Barbie\u2019s dream life. The real world is, well, real. Men in suits at Mattel\u2014led by Will Ferrell\u2019s CEO\u2014make disingenuous speeches about female empowerment; tweens dress Barbie down for wreaking havoc on their self-esteem. Both Barbie and Ken go on quests of self-discovery, and that\u2019s when things get really interesting. The movie doesn\u2019t stick to a single genre: Somehow Barbie is a satire of a toy company\u2019s capitalist ambitions, a searing indictment of the current fraught state of gender relations, a heartwarming if occasionally clich\u00e9d tribute to girl power, and a musical spectacle filled with earworms from Nicki Minaj and Dua Lipa. And then some. \u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here Along with a relentless press tour that has seen Barbies and Kens\u2014or at least the actors playing them\u2014grace the cover of seemingly every magazine (including ours), this summer has also played host to a blitz of Barbie merchandising. Warner Bros. and Mattel have partnered with everyone from Bloomingdales to Pinkberry to roll out pink products. The fashion and makeup collaborations were perhaps to be expected. But Barbie pasta? A Barbie XBox? Barbie and Ken popping up on the Bumble dating app? The scale of this marketing campaign may be unprecedented. Still, the real reason that predictions for Barbie\u2019s box office have nearly doubled in the last few weeks may have less to do with the fact that you can\u2019t cross a street in a major city without spotting a Barbie ad and more to do with the fact that that ad is pink. Barbie is unapologetically leaning into the feminine aesthetic and courting a female audience\u2014still a rarity in Hollywood. Big budget movies, including Barbie\u2019s rivals at the box office, Oppenheimer and Mission: Impossible, tend to be marketed toward a male audience. But, as Gerwig told TIME in her interview for our cover story, the movie was always going to be at its heart a mother-daughter film. Just about every woman has played with Barbie at some point in her life and has an opinion on the doll, whether they love her or hate her. As the Barbie trailer says, \u201cIf you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.\u201d \u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here Fans of Gerwig were probably surprised when she signed on to Barbie. What was the writer-director of Lady Bird and Little Women doing filming what could easily turn into a Mattel commercial? But Gerwig told TIME that she was a huge fan of dolls as a kid\u2014she was still playing with them in junior high: \u201cKids were drinking, and I was playing with dolls.\u201d And she stuffed the film full of ideas\u2014about capitalism, the patriarchy, religion, 1950s Hollywood musicals, and Sylvester Stallone\u2019s sartorial choices, to name just a few. The folks at Mattel have been notoriously protective of Barbie\u2019s image over the years, and the head of Mattel Films, Robbie Brenner, told the toy company executives they would have to \u201cwhite knuckle\u201d it through the creative process as Gerwig and producer-star Robbie pushed the limits on how much they could poke fun of the iconic and controversial doll. That led to occasional clashes, including a moment when Mattel President Richard Dickson flew to London to argue with Gerwig and Robbie over a particular scene. Dickson told TIME they changed his mind by performing the scene for him. The resulting film is a mashup of something both uniquely Gerwig, filled with all her quirks, and a project of corporate ambition to sell more dolls. \u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here Though the marketing push surrounding Barbie has been groundbreaking, ubiquitous, and very, very pink, the most memorable part of the film\u2019s promotionmay be the red carpet (ahem, pink carpet) looks sported by star Margot Robbie, who\u2019s taken inspiration from iconic looks worn by the doll over the years. While it could have been easy for Robbie to simply rely on the ultra-pink Barbiecore trend for the film\u2019s press tour, she and stylist Andrew Mukamal instead turned to the style archives of the world\u2019s most famous doll. From the signature black and white swimsuit and peep toe stiletto mules sported by the first Barbie doll in 1959 to the glamorous glittering black cocktail sheath with matching opera gloves worn by the \u201cSolo in the Spotlight\u201d doll that debuted in 1960, Robbie and Mukamal have found a way to not only channel, but also playfully reinterpret Barbie\u2019s most iconic looks through high fashion collaborations with brands like Schiaparelli, Moschino, and Vivienne Westwood. With her Barbie homages, Robbie isn\u2019t just delivering exquisite looks or compelling marketing for Mattel\u2014she\u2019s also setting a new and incredibly high bar for what the future of the red carpet looks like. Here\u2019s to a new (and far more playful) era of film promotion. \u2014Cady Lang Read the full story here There\u2019s been plenty of buzz around Barbie\u2019s star-studded soundtrack. Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Charli XCX, and Karol G are just a few of the high-profile artists featured on the album, which is executive produced by the superproducer Mark Ronson. In an interview, Mark Ronson describes what it was like making the album, finding the right collaborators, and jumping on the opportunity to work with Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. \u201cThose two make some of my favorite films,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, \u2018Even if I don\u2019t get this gig, I know this is going to be my favorite movie next year.\u2019\u201d So he signed on to do the project, and he and Gerwig hit the ground running: \u201cI became the Robin to her Batman,\u201d he says. And after weeks of teasing, Ronson finally revealed that Billie Eilish\u2014who the producer told TIME was \u201cone of the f-cking greatest living artists around\u201d\u2014had contributed a song called \u201cWhat Was I Made For?\u201d\u2014Moises Mendez II Read the full story here The movie\u2019s trailer makes the case that Barbie is everything and her male companion is \u201cjust Ken.\u201d But it\u2019s clear from the film\u2019s press tour that Ryan Gosling is far more than just Barbie\u2019s main squeeze. Throughout the film\u2019s promotion, Gosling has been anything but plastic\u2014delivering endless charm to journalists and fans alike by talking about how to channel your \u201cKenergy,\u201d sporting numerous dapper pastel suits, extolling the virtues of director Greta Gerwig (and even wearing a shirt with her name on it), and praising his wife Eva Mendes and their two daughters. While he might not be the titular star of Barbie, Gosling has proven he\u2019s a major player\u2014and a joy and delight\u2014when it comes to generating buzz around the film. \u2014Cady Lang Read the full story here What happens when two of the most anticipated films of 2023 debut in the same week? A fan-made movie crossover event known as Barbenheimer. Barbie will be released on July 21, and so will Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan\u2019s film about the development of the atomic bomb. Summer movie-goers are relishing the chance to celebrate a one-day cinematic experience of watching two polar-opposite films back-to-back. According to Elizabeth Frank, AMC\u2019s CCO and executive VP of worldwide programming, over 20,000 tickets have been sold so far at AMC Theaters to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day. The filmmakers and actors from both films are in on the fun, playfully leaning into the crowded film lineup to encourage more people to the movies. Gerwig and Robbie joined in, buying tickets to Oppenheimer, as well as the new Mission Impossible and Indiana Jones movies. Both Nolan and leading man Cillian Murphy of Oppenheimer have addressed the frenzy, with Nolan telling IGN, \u201cI think for those of us who care about movies, we\u2019ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it\u2019s here and that\u2019s terrific.\u201d \u2014Mariah Espada Read the full story here Barbie has landed in hot water in some parts of the world for a seemingly innocuous scene featuring a map that critics have alleged depicts the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d\u2014a maritime border that, although rejected by an international tribunal at The Hague, has been used by China to assert ownership of practically all of the South China Sea. Vietnam authorities banned the movie from being released in the country over the map, which Warner Bros. has said was meant simply to be a \u201cwhimsical, child-like crayon drawing\u201d and was \u201cnot intended to make any type of statement.\u201d The Philippines, another country that disputes China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea, approved Barbie for release\u2014justifying the decision in part by the fact that the line in question has only eight dashes\u2014but requested the map scene be blurred to prevent further misinterpretation. It\u2019s not clear what exactly eight dashes jutting out the side of a misshapen Asia continent are supposed to represent, but it\u2019s not the first time that this issue has caused controversy in the region, raising questions about the relationship between Hollywood and Beijing\u2014and the extent some studios will go to appease China for access to its massive market.\u2014Chad de Guzman Read the full story here There are so many references and easter eggs in Barbie it would take multiple viewings to catch every one. The movie isn\u2019t a musical, exactly, but it does have several song-and-dance numbers inspired by the soundstage musicals of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, particularly Gene Kelly films like An American in Paris and Singin\u2019 in the Rain. But Gerwig also drew inspiration from much more contemporary films, and references to movies like The Matrix, Clueless, and even Zack Snyder\u2019s cut of the Justice League find their way into the movie. And Gerwig didn\u2019t stop at studying film. She also extended our interview for the Barbie cover story just to tell me that specific shots in the film were modeled on Michaelangelo\u2019s Creation of Man, which adorns the Sistine Chapel. Like I said, there\u2019s a lot going on in this movie. \u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here Before there was Barbie, girls mostly played with baby dolls designed to train them to be nurturing mothers. Barbie, dreamt up by Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler, was the first \u201cfashion doll\u201d who had the body and stature of an adult woman. Girls could project their future selves onto the doll rather than care for her. Eventually, they could dress her up to be a doctor, an astronaut, or even president of the United States. Handler named the doll after her daughter Barbara, a tidbit that led Greta Gerwig to ground Barbie in a mother-daughter story. But Handler was a complicated woman who, as the Barbie film alludes to, was pursued by the IRS. In the movie she\u2019s a god-like figure, even if a flawed one. \u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here Barbie outperformed even the most optimistic prognosticator\u2019s predictions about the movie: The movie earned $337 million worldwide its opening weekend, the biggest debut of 2023 so far and the largest box office victory for a female director in the history of film. Though it initially seemed like Barbie and Oppenheimer might cannibalize one another at the box office, it turns out that Barbie buoyed the World War II era biopic: According to a poll by The Quorum, 6% of people who saw Oppenheimer did so because Barbie was sold out. Together, they set a post-pandemic record at the box office. Not since Avengers: Endgame premiered in 2019 have so many people flocked to movie theaters. Studios are already scrambling to find lessons about how future films might coax audiences away from streaming services and back to the cinema.\u2014Eliana Dockterman Read the full story here",

        "title": "U.S. has a New Operating Nuclear Power Reactor",
        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A new reactor at a nuclear power plant in Georgia has entered commercial operation, becoming the first new American reactor built from scratch in decades. Georgia Power Co. announced Monday that Unit 3 at Plant Vogtle, southeast of Augusta, has completed testing and is now sending power to the grid reliably. At its full output of 1,100 megawatts of electricity, Unit 3 can power 500,000 homes and businesses. Utilities in Georgia, Florida and Alabama are receiving the electricity. Nuclear power now makes up about 25% of the generation of Georgia Power, the largest unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co. A fourth reactor is also nearing completion at the site, where two earlier reactors have been generating electricity for decades. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Friday said radioactive fuel could be loaded into Unit 4, a step expected to take place before the end of September. Unit 4 is scheduled to enter commercial operation by March. The third and fourth reactors were originally supposed to cost $14 billion, but are now on track to cost their owners $31 billion. That doesn\u2019t include $3.7 billion that original contractor Westinghouse paid to the owners to walk away from the project. That brings total spending to almost $35 billion. The third reactor was supposed to start generating power in 2016 when construction began in 2009. Vogtle is important because government officials and some utilities are again looking to nuclear power to alleviate climate change by generating electricity without burning natural gas, coal and oil. \u201cThis project shows just how new nuclear can and will play a critical role in achieving a clean energy future for the United States,\u201d Southern Co. CEO Chris Womack said in a statement. \u201cBringing this unit safely into service is a credit to the hard work and dedication of our teams at Southern Company and the thousands of additional workers who have helped build that future at this site.\u201d In Georgia, almost every electric customer will pay for Vogtle. Georgia Power currently owns 45.7% of the reactors. Smaller shares are owned by Oglethorpe Power Corp., which provides electricity to member-owned cooperatives, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton. Oglethorpe and MEAG plan to sell power to cooperatives and municipal utilities across Georgia, as well in Jacksonville, Florida, and parts of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Georgia Power\u2019s 2.7 million customers are already paying part of the financing cost and elected public service commissioners have approved a monthly rate increase of $3.78 a month for residential customers as soon as the third unit begins generating power. That could hit bills in August, two months after residential customers saw a $16-a-month increase to pay for higher fuel costs. Commissioners will decide later who pays for the remainder of the costs of Vogtle, including the fourth reactor.",

        "content": "In the first half of the U.S. Women National Team\u2019s (USWNT) group stage matchup against the Netherlands on Wednesday night in Wellington, New Zealand, American midfielder and co-captain Lindsey Horan found herself exasperated, arms extended, since her teammates missed her open on the pitch. In the second half, Horan found herself chippy, fired up and physical, exchanging pushes with a Dutch player\u2014and pro club teammate\u2014who tackled her too hard. This time, however, Horan would take out her frustration on the soccer ball. With her head. And America averted a World Cup disaster. The game ended in a 1-1 draw: Horan\u2019s second half aerial goal, off a Rose Lavelle corner kick, deadlocked the game in the 62nd minute. The U.S. controlled the game after Horan\u2019s score, failing to convert a few opportunities but walking away with a point. (The Americans held a 17-4 advantage in attempts at goal). Both the U.S. and the Netherlands now have four points in their group. Neither team has yet clinched a place in the knockout round, the result the Americans in particular were surely expecting. Both teams have some work to do in their final group stage games. But both the Americans and the Netherlands are in a strong position to advance. Sign up for \u2018Extra Time,\u2019 our new newsletter that will break down the biggest moments from the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup The Netherlands had taken the lead early. In the 17th minute, the Dutch patiently dissected the U.S. defense and Jill Roord found herself largely unbothered near the top of the 18-yard box. Eight U.S. defenders were in the box with her. But they weren\u2019t close enough to Roord. Her angular strike went through Horan\u2019s legs\u2014she had quite an unpleasant first half\u2014and through the rest of the defense and into the net. The Americans now trailed in a World Cup game for the first time since 2011. In the 47th minute, American defender Crystal Dunn had the ball on her foot, out wide to the left. Four Netherlands players honed in on Dunn. Horan stood in the middle of the pitch, arms extended, incredulous that Dunn wasn\u2019t sending a diagonal pass her way, to push the American attack and perhaps create a much-needed scoring chance against the Dutch. Dunn sent the ball back to Naomi Garma, who also missed Horan, who put her arms out in exasperation for a second time. Dunn got the ball back and pushed it up the sideline\u2014Horan was still open. Dunn and Sophia Smith exchanged passes: Smith, who before the World Cup talked about the singular focus that overcomes her when she sniffs a scoring opportunity, dribbled into the teeth of the Netherlands defense. Horan\u2019s arms went up a third time. Smith lost possession.

For Horan and her teammates, the halftime whistle couldn\u2019t come soon enough. They all needed to regroup. And the switch flipped for the Americans after the break. First off, Lavelle entered the game and provided a spark, almost immediately earning a yellow card for an aggressive tackle. Her instant message: the U.S. would not fall flat in this half. To that end, moments later Danielle van de Donk hit Horan hard. The U.S. co-captain needed some quick treatment on the sideline. When she returned for a corner kick, Horan let van de Donk, her teammate at Lyon, know she didn\u2019t appreciate such roughness. They exchanged trash talk and pushes. The ref tried to get them to make amends. Neither was really having it. Horan, however, got the upper hand: the ensuing corner kick to shut down the chatter. Lavelle lifted the ball towards the box. \u201cRose put in an absolute dime,\u201d Horan said afterwards. Horan leapt and scored the game-tying header. Turns out that the U.S. would avert its first group stage loss since 2011, a year they reached the World Cup final but lost to Japan. When the match ended, Horan and van de Donk exchanged pleasantries and hugged. All\u2019s fair in World Cup competition: the pair could go back to being buddies now. Luckily for the Americans, however, Horan saved the sportsmanship for after the final whistle. She got full-on ticked. At just the right moment.",

        "title": "Alex Morgan Is Entering Her Fourth World Cup in Top Form",
        "content": "Alittle more than a year ago, Alex Morgan felt out of the national-team loop. This was an unsettling position for the star American forward, who\u2019s scored 115 goals\u2014the fifth-most in U.S. history\u2014during her international career. She\u2019s a player who, along with Megan Rapinoe, has been the face of the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team (USWNT) for more than a decade. But Morgan didn\u2019t perform at her usual level at the pandemic-marred 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Spending 35 days away from her then one-year-old daughter, Charlie, taxed her mind. The Americans fell to Canada in the semis and won bronze. Morgan did not attend the last national-team training camp of that year. She wasn\u2019t on the roster for the first few camps of 2022. She\u2019d have to prove her worth all over again. But at 32, not 22. Sign up for \u2018Extra Time,\u2019 our new newsletter that will break down the biggest moments from the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup Then, during the 2022 National Women\u2019s Soccer League season, Morgan exploded. Playing for the expansion San Diego Wave FC, in a comfortable city where she and her husband, pro soccer player Servando Carrasco, plan on settling, Morgan, now 34, won the Golden Boot as the league\u2019s top goal scorer. She netted 15 goals in 17 games. It was her career best. So Morgan\u2019s entering this World Cup, her fourth, in top form. \u201cI know what to expect a little bit more now,\u201d she told TIME Studios for an upcoming Netflix documentary about the team. \u201cIn previous World Cup preps, I probably would be overstressed on things, like what I was eating, what I was doing every single day, how many hours of sleep I was getting. Every little detail. Of course these details matter. But I\u2019m not getting on myself about the little things. If I don\u2019t do something perfect, it\u2019s OK.\u201d \u201cOne thing that is different for Alex than the Olympics is that she had a lot more time to spend with the team,\u201d says USWNT coach Vlatko Andonovski. Morgan had taken some time off after giving birth to Charlie in May 2020, and the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the typical training schedules. \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes for the players to get back into the rhythm, get back in the environment,\u201d says Andonovski. \u201cAnd I think in some ways, it wasn\u2019t fair for Alex before the Olympics. When she\u2019s on the field, she\u2019s comfortable in the environment. She\u2019s been in this environment longer than most players. So I think that we\u2019re going to see the best of Alex this summer.\u201d Morgan agrees with her coach. For one, she believes motherhood has helped her game. \u201c[Parenthood] just makes me feel more balanced all around,\u201d she told PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019m able to give everything to the sport and my teams, but when I go home, I\u2019m not dwelling on whether I had a bad training or bad game. I just have to be a mom and tend to my child\u2019s needs instead of overanalyzing things.\u201d Read More: A Viral French Ad Shows How Women\u2019s Soccer Can Be Just as Exciting as Men\u2019s Charlie also forced Morgan to adjust her tactics. \u201cComing back from giving birth was really hard,\u201d she told TIME Studios. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel super quick or super fast right away. I had already adapted my game to kind of finding the ball, and finding spaces in different ways without having to use my speed. So by the time my speed did come back from pregnancy, I was able to mesh the two together a little bit more.

While Morgan will be expected to shoulder a scoring load in New Zealand and Australia, she\u2019ll also have to guide younger players\u2014like fellow forwards Trinity Rodman, 21, Sophia Smith, 22 and Alyssa Thompson, 18\u2014through their first World Cup experience. \u201cEvery day in camp, Alex is always taking me under her wing,\u201d says Smith. \u201cHelping me, explaining things to me. She\u2019s someone that I\u2019ve looked up to my whole life. I can watch how she goes through life and learn from it, day in and day out.\u201d Rather than feel threatened by the rising stars, Morgan admires them. \u201cThey\u2019re owning where they are,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cThe confidence I\u2019ve seen from these young players is unmatched.\u201d Read More: 5 Controversies to Know About Ahead of the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup She\u2019s looking forward to her first World Cup as a mom.

        "title": "Inside the Los Alamos Lab Making Nuclear Bomb Parts Again",
        "content": "Something unusual is happening inside the plutonium facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. PF-4, as it is known to top government officials, is the heart of America\u2019s nuclear complex, a lab where scientists and engineers study and experiment on highly radioactive materials in tight secrecy. Recently, employees have discovered yellow plastic tents encasing equipment and rendering it inaccessible. At Los Alamos, where even the cleaning crews and firefighters require high-level security clearances, you might think the tents are designed to restrict access to the latest wonder weapon or scientific breakthrough. The truth is more mundane\u2014and more telling. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our expansion plans,\u201d Matthew Johnson, a senior lab manager, tells me during a rare tour of the fortified building. \u201cAll the old stuff is coming out.\u201d PF-4 is being transformed from an experimental laboratory that focuses mostly on research into a facility that mass-produces plutonium \u201cpits,\u201d the grapefruit-sized cores inside every nuclear bomb in America\u2019s arsenal. Los Alamos\u2014 the lab synonymous with the dark art of nuclear-weapon development\u2014hasn\u2019t produced a certified pit in over a decade and has never had to produce more than 10 in a single year. But in 2018, Congress passed a law mandating that PF-4 produce 30 pits a year by 2026. Around $5 billion has already been spent to overhaul the cramped, aging facilities. The Biden Administration has pumped $4.6 billion into Los Alamos this fiscal year alone\u2014a 130% budget increase over what the lab received just five years ago. Truckloads of new work stations, lathes, and furnaces are set for installation. Coast-to-coast recruiting efforts are underway to increase the lab\u2019s workforce, which is already at a record 17,273. Not long ago, such ambitions would have been unthinkable. Following the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991, the U.S. stopped designing, building, and testing new nuclear warheads. Stockpiles were slashed, labs\u2019 budgets cut, and a highly skilled workforce allowed to dwindle. But after a three-decade break from manufacturing nuclear weapons, the U.S. is getting back into the game. Another arms race may be upon us, triggered by China\u2019s growing ambitions and escalating hostilities with Russia, the world\u2019s other nuclear superpower. Since President Biden took office, both nations have wielded their arsenals to threaten adversaries and coerce neighbors. The last remaining nuclear-arms treaty, known as New START, is set to expire in 2026, raising fears about a new era of unchecked expansion. All nine nuclear powers are scrambling to modernize their arsenals and build new weapons. The effort to restart America\u2019s nuclear-weapons manufacturing program in response represents the biggest test since the Manhattan Project. A wide range of arms-control experts and nuclear watchdogs, as well as a handful of lawmakers, are frantically sounding the alarms, warning of the existential risks of the course that leaders in both parties have taken. Critics say the U.S. is repeating the mistakes of the Cold War by funneling billions of taxpayer dollars into weapons that will hopefully never be used and haven\u2019t been tested in more than a generation. They worry about the potential environmental disasters. Washington is reacting to geopolitical concerns without considering the consequences of restarting our own bomb-making factories, says Greg Mello, executive director at the Los Alamos Study Group, an Albuquerque-based watchdog organization. \u201cWe\u2019re rushing into a new arms race with our eyes wide shut,\u201d Mello says, \u201cforgetting everything that went wrong before.\u201d At PF-4, they are well past such debates. Lab managers are busy unsealing and combing through decades-old archives to extract the technical and engineering expertise for plutonium pits that has been all but lost in the U.S. To get a sense of how the headlong rush is unfolding, and the risks that come with it, I accompanied Johnson, a tall, balding metallurgist who\u2019s spent 21 years at the lab, as he led a small group of reporters on a rare trip inside the center of PF-4. It took more than a year to receive government approval for the visit to the facility. All plutonium operations are required to pause if outsiders are on the floor. But with a brief work-stoppage in place, we were given a day pass in late June to slip behind the tiers of barbed-wire fences, code-accessed security doors, and legions of armed guards to catch a glimpse of America\u2019s new nuclear age. Before stepping onto the PF-4 operations floor, we pulled on thick lab coats, cotton shoe-coverings, protective goggles, and personal radiation-detection badges. It\u2019s a windowless, low-slung facility, with a long gray hallway dividing a series of rooms purpose-built for plutonium production. Identity confirmation is required at each door, even though every employee at PF-4 has a Q-level security clearance from the Energy Department, the highest a civilian can hold. Weapons-grade plutonium has a radioactive half-life of 24,000 years. The level of radioactivity in these rooms, called \u201chot areas,\u201d is constantly monitored. When you walk into a new chamber, you\u2019re met with the unnerving clicks of a Geiger counter reverberating inside. The personal-safety protocols underline the stakes. One member of our tour had a notebook quarantined after it mistakenly dropped to the floor. Before leaving a room, we had our hands and feet individually checked for contamination. We also were required to take two full body-scans, stepping into different floor-to-ceiling radiation-detection machines, before we left the facility. Inside each production room, workers stand under bright fluorescent lights by a series of linked stainless-steel work stations called gloveboxes. They place their hands into specialized rubber gloves and peer through leaded-glass windows as they shape the plutonium. An accidental slip of the hand could result in catastrophe. There\u2019s virtually no safe level of human exposure to plutonium if it\u2019s inhaled. Even the smallest speck\u2014a one-thousandth of a gram, hidden to the human eye\u2014could kill. \u201cWe have to account for every flake,\u201d Johnson says. The lab has an elaborate air circulation system; the rooms are at a lower pressure than the outside hallways. Each glovebox has a slight vacuum, designed to ensure that if there is a breach, the particles are contained inside the sealed box. The U.S. no longer manufactures new plutonium, so workers at PF-4 take old pits from retired warheads sent from the Pantex plant in the Texas panhandle, which assembles, disassembles, and stores parts for America\u2019s nuclear arsenal. The pits are recycled through a process that purifies them of radioactive elements, which accumulate over time. To do this, plutonium winds its way from glovebox to glovebox through an overhead trolley system snaking through the complex. Dumbwaiters move it up and down from the trolley. The plutonium is melted, machined, welded, and inspected. Mastering these skills can take up to four years of training and mentorship, Johnson says. Each worker must undergo routine mental and physical health checks throughout the year to ensure they can handle weapon components. Up to 1,000 employees work inside PF-4 on a given day, but less than 10 can perform the final step of the assembly, which involves welding pieces of cast plutonium together to form a pit. The task must be done by hand, inside a large walk-in glovebox. Workers wear respirators and several layers of personal protective equipment. The pit then undergoes an inspection process: it\u2019s leak-checked and radiographed, like a medical CT scan, to ensure it meets specifications. If it passes, it\u2019s stamped with a small diamond and sent back to Texas, where it will stay until it\u2019s plugged into a new W87-1 warhead, which is still under development, expected to be completed sometime within the next decade. The W87-1 will be the first 100% newly manufactured nuclear warhead in the U.S. stockpile since the end of the Cold War. Its pit will be encased in plastic explosives designed to detonate with impeccable timing, compressing it, in just a fraction of a second, from the size of a grapefruit into the size of a golf ball. Fission from this first stage of the process spits out neutrons, triggering an atomic chain reaction that generates a massive release of energy\u2014an explosion. The subsequent radiation, pressure, and energy then fuses two types of heavy hydrogen, tritium and deuterium, to form helium. Additional neutrons fire from this process, creating a fission-fusion feedback loop that happens so quickly it appears instantaneous. It culminates with a fireball that reaches into the millions of degrees, followed by a blast that can level buildings for miles around. Read More: Donald Trump is Playing a Dangerous Game of Nuclear Poker. Los Alamos has made 11 development pits so far this year, but none of them are destined for warheads. The first proof-of-concept weaponized pit is slated for completion at the end of 2024, says Robert Webster, Los Alamos\u2019 deputy director for weapons. Webster says he\u2019s confident his team can reach 30 pits per year by 2030. \u201cIt could be sooner,\u201d he says, adding that the most important thing is that it\u2019s done right. \u201cWe\u2019re still cleaning up the legacy mess that we made by working the way we did.\u201d Others are skeptical. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in January that it\u2019s highly unlikely PF-4 will be able to meet its congressional mandate of building 30 pits annually on the prescribed timetable. Another larger facility, the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, which has never produced a single pit, has been tasked with producing 50 per year by 2030. The challenges of building new facilities and re-configuring existing ones with cutting-edge equipment are compounded by the extreme dangers of radioactive plutonium and waste disposal. All this may result in the federal government spending up to $24 billion before Los Alamos and Savannah River can reach their combined target of 80 pits per year, the report says. And rushing has its risks.  The environmental hazards of producing plutonium pits are well-established. The last time the U.S. made pits on a mass scale was in 1989, at the Rocky Flats site in Colorado. Production at the plant, which churned out about 1,000 pits per year, was shut down following a raid by the FBI and Environmental Protection Agency that discovered serious environmental violations. There was enough radioactive waste on the premises to cover a football field to a depth of 20 ft. Some 62 pounds of plutonium were found caked inside the plant\u2019s air ducts. Plutonium poses grave danger to anyone who doesn\u2019t have proper protective equipment, and the total human toll of the work performed at Rocky Flats is unknown. Judy Padilla, 76, worked 22 years at Rocky Flats, most of them handling plutonium in gloveboxes. Padilla says she\u2019s horrified that another generation will be manufacturing pits. She developed a host of medical issues that began during her time at the plant, including a tumor that required a mastectomy of her right breast. Her husband Charles, who also worked at the plant, died in 2014 after battling kidney cancer. Padilla, who attributes both cases to radiation and chemical exposure at Rocky Flats, received $125,000 from the government after Charles died. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, passed at the end of the Clinton Administration, provides funding to former nuclear employees on an individual basis, but Padilla says it\u2019s littered with loopholes that are better designed to deny claimants than help them. \u201cMy advice to younger people doing this work is: Be careful,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought my government would back me up if I got sick and take care of me. That never happened. It sounds really bitter. But yeah, I\u2019m bitter. I consider myself a walking time-bomb.\u201d The safety record of Los Alamos has always been intensely scrutinized, particularly in the post-Cold War years. \u201cIs There Really a Cowboy Culture of Arrogance at Los Alamos?\u201d ran a Dec. 2004 headline in the trade publication Physics Today. The question followed a series of high-profile lapses at the lab, including a trove of missing classified documents and an incident in which an intern suffered an eye injury from a laser. The biggest blunder arguably came in 2011, when technicians took a photograph of eight ingots of plutonium lined up side-by-side on a work table to impress their bosses. It may have looked cool to them, but putting radioactive rods in close proximity risked triggering a chain reaction that could have produced a fatal burst of radiation, capable of killing anyone in the room. Plutonium pit production ended the following year, and hasn\u2019t restarted until now. In 2018, Triad National Security was named as the new contractor to run the lab for the U.S. Energy Department. The company has stated that safety is a core pillar of its operations, including pit production. But workers\u2019 missteps continue to be cited by the the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, which provides independent federal oversight. Jill Hruby, head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Energy Department agency that oversees nuclear weapons, wrote a letter in May to Triad for a formal explanation on four \u201cnuclear safety events\u201d that took place between February and July 2021. The incidents included two separate floods, a glovebox breach, and an instance in which an unsafe amount of fissionable material was placed in a dropbox. An investigation attached to the letter noted a \u201csignificant lack of attention or carelessness\u201d for worker and public safety.  Mistakes like these only heighten skepticism about how Los Alamos can possibly mass-produce plutonium pits on the appointed schedule without risking the health of its workers and surrounding community. Lab officials recognize that the project will generate unprecedented levels of hazardous waste. The most radioactive waste Los Alamos produces, called transuranic waste, primarily involves contaminated gloves, tools, equipment, and other debris that are typically stuffed into 55-gallon drums stored on site until they can be hauled to an underground facility in southeastern New Mexico. The lab projected the number of drums to spike to 2,000 this year, double the tally of just three years ago, according to a 2021 report delivered to Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to comprehend the level of contamination, the diversion of amounts of money into something that, in my view, will not improve national security,\u201d says Jay Coghlan, executive director of Nuclear Watch New Mexico, a Santa Fe-based watchdog. The dangers, of course, stretch far beyond New Mexico. Dread of nuclear annihilation hung over the globe throughout the Cold War. That fear is practically inscribed by history in the creosote-dotted hills around Los Alamos, the birthplace of The Bomb. Located atop a secluded mesa between the Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains, its transformation from a high desert outpost into a boomtown began in 1943, when more than 8,000 scientists, soldiers, and other personnel arrived to work for the Manhattan Project\u2019s secret \u201cSite Y\u201d laboratory, under the direction of the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. The picturesque setting for Oppenheimer\u2019s pursuit of an atomic bomb contributed to the sense of insularity. Outsiders were not welcome. The people who worked and lived at Los Alamos were bound by secrecy and, with few exceptions, unable to leave. To this day, the people on this isolated plateau say they\u2019re \u201con the hill,\u201d which by default means that everyone else in the world is \u201coff\u201d it. But the ingrained seclusion of Los Alamos isn\u2019t just semantic and geographic. It\u2019s hard to find anyone in the community of 13,000 who doesn\u2019t either work at the lab or have a neighbor, friend, or family member who does. It is a company town where even the street names gesture to its controversial past: Oppenheimer Drive, Trinity Drive, Manhattan Loop. The lab developed the first atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed and maimed hundreds of thousands of Japanese in 1945. Those were crude, comparatively simple devices that produced explosive yields measured in kilotons, or thousands of tons of TNT. In the arms race that ensued over the following decades, weapons designers at Los Alamos came up with ever more lightweight and destructive weapons\u2014some so small that they allowed for a dozen city-busting warheads to fit inside a single ballistic missile\u2019s nose cone. Today\u2019s staged-thermonuclear devices produce explosive yields measured in megatons, or millions of tons of TNT\u2014weapons far more lethal than Oppenheimer\u2019s original. When the U.S. began pursuing such bombs, Oppenheimer discouraged it, calling them a \u201cweapon of genocide.\u201d Oppenheimer envisioned the A-bomb program as a one-off for a narrow mission. Instead, nuclear bomb-making became a full-fledged American industry. Los Alamos was just one facet of a nationwide nuclear-industrial complex, cranking out weapons components for an arsenal that the U.S. wielded to deter the Soviet Union\u2019s aggression by threatening \u201cmassive retaliation\u201d and \u201cmutually assured destruction.\u201d In 1967, around the height of the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear stockpile reached 31,255. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, however, nuclear weapons-production stalled. The number of U.S. sites involved in making warheads was cut in half. President George H.W. Bush declared a self-imposed nuclear-weapons testing moratorium in 1992. The number of warheads in the U.S. stockpile was continually reduced through a series of arms-control treaties with Moscow. Today the nuclear stockpile stands at an estimated 5,244 warheads\u2014an 83% reduction from its Cold War peak. Read More: The $100 Billion Mission to Modernize America\u2019s Aging Nuclear Missiles. The reduction brought challenges: if the U.S. could no longer build or design the next world-altering bomb, what could government officials do to retain the expertise of scientists? And how would the ensure the integrity of the arsenal without being able to test the products? Nuclear bombs contain more than 4,000 parts, and most of those parts are now more than 30 years old. Ask yourself: If you left a 1993 Ford Mustang in the barn\u2014a temperature-controlled vault of a barn, but a barn nonetheless\u2014would you feel 100% certain that everything would work properly when you turned the ignition? Oh, and don\u2019t forget that your life may depend on it. The answer the Energy Department came up with was to harness computer simulations and experiments to evaluate the reliability\u2014and extend the life spans of\u2014America\u2019s nuclear weapons. The most vexing dilemma was assessing plutonium, an element only discovered 80 years ago. To find out how it ages, Los Alamos ran experiments in the early 2000s that found plutonium pits changed over the years in ways that could impact weapons\u2019 performance. But the studies couldn\u2019t provide specifics on when exactly plutonium aged out. At first, scientists concluded the pits should last for 100 years or more. But in 2019, after Congress began pushing for more pits, JASON, the long-time independent scientific advisory group to the U.S. government, urged the Energy Department to reestablish large-scale pit production \u201cas expeditiously as possible to mitigate against potential risks posed by (plutonium) aging on the stockpile.\u201d The day before my tour of PF-4, I visited the modernistic three-story Municipal Building in Los Alamos to see how the small town was preparing for the coming influx of scientists, technicians, engineers, security guards and support staff. \u201cWe\u2019re building as fast as we can,\u201d says Paul Andrus, the community-development director. Roads are being widened. Expansion plans are underway for Atomic City mass transit. Wooden skeletons of condos and housing developments are in the process of getting built in any area they\u2019ll fit. But finding suitable spots for new construction is a challenge. In addition to the nearly 40-sq. mi. lab, Los Alamos is hemmed in by canyons and abuts Bandelier National Monument. The lack of housing is concerning not only because of the incoming workers, but also the teachers, doctors, and other professionals who will be needed alongside them. \u201cWe\u2019re just out of space,\u201d says Denise Derkacs, a former lab employee who now serves on the county council. \u201cWe would love to help support the lab more, but we just have no more land to build on.\u201d This lack of available space has forced Los Alamos to forge closer ties with communities off the hill. The lab leased two buildings in Santa Fe, located more than 30 miles to the southeast, where it moved hundreds of employees not involved in classified work. The transition, which began in 2021, marked the first time in a half century that the lab had a presence in the city. The pace of expansion is stunning to those familiar with Los Alamos, including Siegfried Hecker, who served as lab director from 1986 to 1997. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the Cold War, but it\u2019s a Cold War-like environment,\u201d Hecker told me. \u201cI did not expect a renewed arms competition when I left Los Alamos.\u201d In the last two years of his term at the lab, Hecker signed the first annual letters of certification attesting to the safety, security, and reliability of the weapons in the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Those letters, delivered each year to the U.S. secretaries of defense and energy, reads in part: \u201cI certify that the nuclear weapons we designed are safe and reliable without the resumption of nuclear testing at this time.\u201d Every sitting president must have this letter on his or her desk to have complete confidence in the nuclear arsenal. Hecker told me signing that letter marked a consequential moment in his life, and in the history of the nation. Resuming pit production is necessary, Hecker believes, because of the unanswered questions about how plutonium ages. But he anticipates the process will trigger calls to resume underground weapons testing in Nevada, in order to redouble confidence in the old stuff and to ensure the new stuff works. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government will do that, because that will open Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we go back and test, we will lose more than we gain.\u201d Of the nine nuclear powers, only North Korea has tested in this century. If the U.S. begins doing so, other nations are sure to follow suit. In the high-stakes world of nuclear weapons, a single political decision sets off an unpredictable chain reaction that can put us all at risk. As we enter this new nuclear era, it\u2019s not yet clear how much we\u2019ve learned from the past.\u2014With reporting by Leslie Dickstein TIME receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Outrider Foundation.

        "title": "How Offshore Wind Can Supply 25% of U.S. Electricity by 2050",
        "content": "Currently, six turbines off the coast of Rhode Island account for the lion\u2019s share of the U.S.\u2019s offshore wind energy production, providing 30 megawatts of electricity, or enough power to supply about 5% of the homes in one of the country\u2019s smallest states. In less than three decades, though, researchers believe that massive offshore turbines could be producing more than 10,000 times as much energy, enough to supply up to a quarter of the country\u2019s future electricity demand.  Those were the findings of a detailed new report from the University of California Berkeley, which concluded offshore wind could feasibly supply between 10% and 25% of the country\u2019s energy demand by 2050, thanks to long coastlines with sustained winds in many areas, and falling turbine costs.  Currently, countries in Europe and Asia are far ahead in building turbines off their shores, with the U.S. only now getting started after decades of delay\u2014the country\u2019s first large-scale offshore wind farm started laying underwater foundations off the coast of Massachusetts in June. But the U.S. is almost certainly going to need more of its own offshore power. Simply put, to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050, the renewable energy buildout will have to be enormous. Not only does the U.S. have to decarbonize its current electrical system, replacing the natural gas and coal plants that still account for about 60% of electricity nationwide, but the country also needs to build out vastly more renewable energy to replace gas powered cars and oil-burning boilers with electric vehicles and heat pumps. Hypothetically, the U.S. could attempt to build out all that renewable energy on land, though the feat would be monumental. To supply all the energy the U.S. is likely to need in the coming decades, it\u2019ll have to start building land-based wind farms and solar panels at about five times the rate compared to 2021, according to the report. That year was already a record-breaker, with the U.S. building out an enormous 28 gigawatts of solar and wind power. That\u2019s roughly equivalent to the entire power plant capacity of Washington state. If the U.S. makes a big offshore wind push, however, things are likely to be somewhat easier: land-based renewables will only have to be built out at about three or four times the 2021 rate, according to the report.  But launching an explosion of offshore wind development is no simple task. There\u2019s the fact of determined political opposition, often funded by the oil industry. And it\u2019ll also require an array of federal, state, and local policies, as well as hundreds of billions of dollars in investment, according to the Berkeley researchers, who worked with climate think tanks GridLab and Energy Innovation on the report.  The Biden Administration has already set a goal to build 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030, but the U.S. government will have to scale that up to something resembling the goals in Europe if the sector is to have a shot of potentially supplying a quarter of the country's electricity. E.U. leaders are aiming to have 300 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2050.  The push will also require a lot more state and federal bureaucrats. Permitting agencies will need more staff to cut down wait times for companies trying to develop new offshore wind sites, while agencies responsible for planning electrical transmission systems will need bigger budgets to start devising regional electrical systems that will be able to efficiently distribute the new power, according to the report (such pre-planning could save billions of dollars in electricity costs down the road). The U.S. will also need to expand workforce training programs, build up massive new supply chains, including huge new domestic steel plants, and build up port infrastructure to handle the task of bringing enormous turbine components out to sea.  Creating an entirely new clean energy industry is sure to have some notable benefits as well, even beyond helping stave off the worst effects of climate change. Such a buildout could, for instance, help create almost 390,000 jobs, according to the report authors\u2019 estimates. \u201cThe technical ability to build out America\u2019s offshore wind sector and enjoy all the benefits of clean, reliable, affordable electricity is there,\u201d Mike O\u2019 Boyle, senior director of electricity policy at Energy Innovation said in a statement. \u201cWe just need political leadership to pass the right policies.\u201d",

        "title": "Life Expectancy Proves How Far Black Americans Have Come",
        "content": "In August 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that over the last two years, Black Americans\u2019 life expectancy declined to about 71 years old, six years lower than their white counterparts. National disparities in life expectancy can represent the permanency of racism, offering little reason for hope. But in Manassas Park, Va. and Weld County, Colo., the mean-life expectancy for Black residents is 96\u2014a national high among all Black citizens by county. Black people are living in their 80s in larger Democratic jurisdictions like Montgomery County, Maryland and smaller Republican districts like Collier County, Florida. My colleague Jonathan Rothwell and I reported hundreds of places that exceed commonly held expectations in Brookings\u2019s recently released Black Progress Index, an interactive tool and report developed in partnership with the NAACP that provides a means to understand the health and well-being of Black people and the conditions that shape their lives. Instead of comparing Black people to white people, we examine life expectancy differences among the Black population in different places. This method reveals the locales where Black people are thriving. Researchers often sloppily compare rates of home ownership, educational attainment, income and mortality without attending to past and present discrimination that intended to create disparities. Consequently, broad national averages void of context policy and local contexts camouflage the very real progress that\u2019s occurring across the country. Still, in places like Jefferson County, Ohio, the average Black person lives 33 fewer years than Manassas Park, Va. and Weld County, Colo. That gap is roughly equivalent to 100 years of progress in living standards, medical science, and public health. Black people are not a monolith. They have widely different outcomes in very different places. Local contexts matter as Black people do. Lower life expectancy in counties and metro areas across the country suggests that people are losing battles against racism. But geographic areas where Black people are thriving offer more than hope: People\u2019s civic actions are delivering positive change. Read More: Why John Lewis Kept Telling the Story of Civil Rights, Even Though It Hurt What accounts for such vast differences? Life expectancy, a cumulative measure of health and well-being, summarizes both the biological and non-biological influences on our lives.\u202fBecause race is a sociological construct and not a biological one, we should assume disparities in life expectancy represent differences in non-biological influences on our lives. Our current life expectancy data suggest that people are breaking down specific social conditions that influence longevity, giving real reason for optimism. Using a common machine-learning algorithm to select variables and rank their importance, the Index identifies 13 social conditions that predict Black life expectancy.\u202fMany are those one might expect, such as income, education, housing, and family composition. Others were more surprising, including the top predictor of high Black life expectancy: larger shares of foreign-born Black residents. One standard deviation above the mean in this variable adds one year to predicted life Black expectancy. For instance, Brooklyn, N.Y. is in the 89th percentile of life expectancy at 78.5. The more than 43% of Black residents of King\u2019s County who are immigrants, places it in the 98th percentile among all counties. The cause for this interpretation is unclear; it may be a pure composition effect, in that foreign-born Black Americans enjoy better health than the native Black population. Though, this data points to a larger question: Is less exposure to U.S. racism good for your health? On the other end of the spectrum, a surprising predictor of low Black life expectancy is religious membership. Keeping in mind all the social determinants that showed to be significant in our study are correlational, not causal. Revoking a church membership will not automatically add years to a person\u2019s life. The challenge is understanding why religious adherence is associated with lower life expectancy. Church goers are more likely to be obese and, on the surface, asking \u201cJesus to take the wheel\u201d may negate any agency we have in influencing our health outcome. We also know that place-based bias that comes out of the wash of housing devaluation hurts the families and institutions, including churches, in those locales. More research is needed to uncover the conditions and behaviors underlying all the variables that strongly influence life expectancy. The fact that we realize progress and stagnation in Black life expectancy in different places makes clear that people have agency. The gains and losses reflect that. When we take an overly optimistic or pessimistic view of the state of Black America and treat Black people as a monolith, we don\u2019t see localized stories of growth, determination, and thriving. The diversity of places where Black people are thriving suggests that it has something to do with Black people themselves. In places like Montgomery County, Md., individuals, civil rights groups, organizers, and politicians are dismantling the architecture of inequality that takes away years of life. That said, we still need to examine and throw away the overly optimistic position on race relations\u2014that the country has moved beyond slavery, Jim Crow racism, and the array of discriminatory policies and their long-term effects. People who hold this perspective contend that America is a level playing field and that with effort, Black people can achieve anything a white person can. But locales that post life expectancies under 70 perform poorly on environment or institutional indicators like the air and school quality, suggesting that life is harder in some places due to systemically racist forces. In Lowndes County, Ala. where Montgomery is the county seat, Black life expectancy is 68.5. In Greenwood, Miss., it\u2019s 67.3. In Salem, Ore., life expectancy is 64.4. It\u2019s also worth speculating on seemingly obvious reason why some cities, like Jackson, Miss., don\u2019t post higher rates than 72.6. Jackson has higher homeownership rates than most places (94th percentile) and a higher percentage business ownership (59th percentile). But the recent water crises show how local politics of Mississippi play out in lower investments in the city\u2019s water infrastructure, which plays out in other municipal services that impact life expectancy like education. \u201cSocial reforms move slowly,\u201d wrote W.E.B. Du Bois, suggesting that we must learn from our circumstances in ways that reject intemperance and blame. \u201c[W]hen Right is reinforced by calm but persistent Progress we\u202fsomehow all feel that in the end it must triumph.\u201d Society is toiling with the same struggles around racism that Du Bois faced at the turn of the 20th century. Nonetheless, we must take the time to recognize empirical signs of progress and not rush toward unsophisticated, untruthful narratives of hopelessness or blind ignorance that remove or dismiss our agency. A path of progress demands that we have a clear view of the social, political, and economic landscape in which we live. Recognizing progress and defeats will have us see the very real capacity for future change. The assumption\u2014backed with data\u2014that Black people in places with higher life expectancy had a hand in their outcomes should inspire us to seek change in places where discrimination is robbing people of years of life.",

The National Weather Service said a \u201cdangerous\u201d heat wave began to scorch the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Thursday and will continue into the weekend. Severe thunderstorms and flash floods are possible for parts of the Northeast and South, New England and South Florida.

The prediction for continued excessive heat comes a day after the World Meteorological Organization and the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service declared July 2023 the hottest month on record. On Thursday, heat and humidity in major cities along the East Coast, including Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City, created a real feel above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).

Due to the extreme heat, two of the nation\u2019s largest power grids are under stress, which could affect Americans' ability to cool off. The country's largest power grid, PJM Interconnection, declared a level one energy emergency alert for its 13-state grid on Wednesday, meaning the company is concerned about its ability to provide enough electricity. \u201cPJM currently has enough generation to meet forecast demand, but operators continue to monitor the grid conditions for any changes,\u201d said Jeffrey Shields, a spokesperson for the company. PJM isn't the only electrical grid to issue such an alert.

And a spokesperson for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which covers most of Texas, said they expect their grid will operate per usual during this latest blast of extreme weather across the country.",

        "title": "Racism Is Not a Mental Illness\u2014But It\u2019s Complicated",
        "content": "Everyone knows that Law & Order plotlines are often, as they say, ripped from the headlines. But Dr. Alvin Poussaint, 88, knows this on another level: An emeritus professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, he has had the unusual experience of seeing his ideas incorporated into a season 12 episode of the long-running show. In it, a white working stiff murders a Black CEO in a dispute over a New York City taxicab. When the trial begins, a respected Black psychiatrist takes the stand to present his idea that the defendant suffers from \u201cextreme racism,\u201d a mental illness. His lawyers argue that extreme racism has such a complete hold on the defendant that it mitigates their client\u2019s legal responsibility for the murder. In the final moments, the audience is encouraged to feel that it\u2019s a victory for justice, for law and order, when the jury rejects the psychiatrist\u2019s ideas, Poussaint tells me with a tinge of disdain. In the real world, Poussaint was that psychiatrist. Sort of. While he never brought his ideas to the witness stand inside the New York City courthouse behind those massive stone steps that Law & Order made famous, in 1999 he shared his theories on the link between mental health and extreme forms of bigotry on the op-ed pages of the New York Times. In doing so, he helped set off a debate that ended with the American psychiatric establishment publicly rejecting the concept\u2014partly on the grounds that so many people are racists. But even now, after nearly a decade during which the number of hate crimes has steadily increased, the question of the relationship between bigotry and mental illness has never fully been resolved. In fact, recent high-profile incidents have made public perception of that dynamic perhaps as muddled as ever. The issue comes up in relation to everything from major mass shootings to pop-culture discourse. The racist attack at a Buffalo, N.Y., supermarket, for which the gunman pleaded guilty this week to state murder and domestic terrorism charges, prompted calls for the country to \u201cget serious about mental health\u201d as well as pleas not to talk about the shooting as a matter of psychiatric illness rather than a racist hate crime. Read more: Anti-Black Violence Has Long Been the Most Common American Hate Crime\u2014And We Still Don\u2019t Know the Full Extent It\u2019s hard to distinguish what psychiatric experts have decided not to define, to separate what Poussaint calls \u201ceveryday racism\u201d\u2014covering the span from systemic discrimination to microaggressions\u2014from the extreme version, which he and others have described as the point at which bigotry so deeply shapes behavior that a person struggles to function and sometimes becomes dangerous. But the question is more than just a thought experiment. If extreme racism were to become accepted as a mental illness per se, more suspects in hate-crime cases could potentially have recourse to mount \u201cinsanity\u201d defenses in court. And given all the mass shootings and disturbing public events in which extreme racism appears to have played some part since Poussaint first described his ideas, it\u2019s also hard not to wonder. Might developing a research-backed extreme-racism diagnosis\u2014and sound treatments\u2014have saved lives? Though the FBI typically releases data each fall detailing the prior year\u2019s hate-crimes statistics, the agency has not yet done so in 2022. But social conditions are rife, experts say, for the increase to continue. (In 2020, the most recent year for which FBI data is available, the agency reported 8,263 incidents\u2014an increase of nearly a thousand over the prior year, despite 452 fewer agencies reporting\u2014and most experts believe the real number is higher.) Police have noted that 47 out of 100 people arrested for hate crimes in New York City in early 2022 \u201chave prior documentation of an [emotionally disturbed person] incident.\u201d So the stakes are high for the nation\u2019s courtrooms to respond to the trauma unleashed by that dynamic\u2014and for Americans to decide what constitutes a just outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d says Sander Gilman, a historian at Emory University who researches the relationship between health, science, law, and society, and who has long taught a course on extremism. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to start with two things that I call Gilman\u2019s Law: not all racists are crazy, but crazy people can be racists.\u201d Thanks in part to the influence of pop culture\u2014not least those TV police procedurals\u2014many assume that insanity pleas are common. In reality, mental-health defenses are rare, and even more rarely lead to reduced punishment. Mounting that kind of defense requires time and significant resources to gather evidence and expert testimony, so in practice it is not an avenue available to all defendants. In England and the U.S., courts began to reliably consider the mental health of defendants only in the 19th century. The M\u2019Naghten rule, a standard for determining a defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of a crime, was established in 1840s England. It holds that only the sane can be held responsible for their actions. As a result, the question of mental fitness\u2014sufficient sanity to participate meaningfully in one\u2019s own defense\u2014is sometimes evaluated before a trial. (Whether the state has an obligation or right to treat such an illness in order for the person to then stand trial is, Gilman says, a question that goes back as far as the idea of such a defense.) Once a competency decision has been made, the accused who do go to trial have the right to a defense. In some cases, that may include an option for a jury to find the defendant not guilty by reason of mental disorder. In others, ideas about the mental health of the defendant may more informally shape what evidence is presented. But so-called \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d defenses are used in only about 1% of cases, says Michael Boucai, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law and an expert on mental health and other social issues in courtrooms. Those defenses are successful in even fewer cases; in fact, such a tactic often backfires or results in a defendant confined for a longer term inside a hospital than that person would have spent in prison, sometimes with no end date. And even rarer\u2014though not unheard of\u2014is an attempt to use racism or other bigotry as an indicator of mental-health challenges, he says. \u201cI think it would be extremely hard,\u201d says Boucai, \u201cI mean extremely hard, to succeed on the theory that extreme racism per se\u2014particularly subscription to a theory\u2014is a mental illness for the purpose of criminal responsibility. Just because you have a psychologist or psychiatrist saying this person is mentally ill does not mean the law has to [accept] that.\u201d (Nor does the defendant: Dylann Roof, the white man who shot and killed nine Black worshippers inside a Charleston, S.C., church in 2015\u2014whose legal team used words like \u201cdelusional,\u201d \u201cabnormal,\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d to describe their client\u2014rejected advice from his lawyers to attempt to avoid the death penalty by allowing them to argue that he was insane or suffering from a mental defect at the time of the shooting.) Some fear that raising mental-health issues in court runs the risk of bolstering inaccurate myths about the mentally ill. In reality, mentally ill people are disproportionately more likely to become the victims of crime, and most do nothing to victimize others. And, as has been observed after so many headlinemaking crimes, suspects from privileged groups are more likely to have their actions described as illness in need of treatment instead of criminal evil meriting punishment. Some experts fear that shifting the conversation to questions of mental health can also draw attention away from hateful ideas embraced by the person accused of the crime\u2014ideas that are today often shared by people, including public figures, whose mental health is not questioned. That\u2019s how important social problems that require the nation\u2019s attention are transformed into one individual\u2019s medical problems, says W. Carson Byrd, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. Column: We Need to Take Action to Address the Mental Health Crisis in This Pandemic That line of thinking is particularly problematic in a culture prone to dismiss the need for systemwide reforms to address inequality, Byrd says. It can foster an emphasis on quick fixes for the world\u2019s long-standing problems with bigotry. (In 2012, for example, a team of British researchers announced that an existing heart and blood-pressure drug appeared to reduce implicit bias after a study involving just 36 subjects.) \u201cWhite supremacy is a very normal part of society,\u201d says Byrd, who is also the faculty director of research initiatives at his university\u2019s National Center for Institutional Diversity. It is not a good or productive part of society, he points out, but a deeply entrenched one. \u201cOne of the detriments of trying to look at racism as a form of psychopathology or mental illness is that it makes that [illness] abhorrent, as if everything else is working in a certain [non-racist] way.\u201d Research has also long shown that bigotry is not an inborn human trait, but rather something learned from our environments, Byrd says. While racism can influence one\u2019s mental health, describing racism itself\u2014even \u201cextreme racism\u201d\u2014as a mental illness implies that bigotry exists beyond our individual and collective control. \u201cBy medicalizing [extreme racism], making it something curable, a mental-health disorder, it pulls away from having those broader conversations about how society is impacting people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just try to figure out, \u2018How do we fix this one person?\u2019\u201d This problem, Boucai notes, can already be clearly seen in discussions about gun crime, and mass shootings in particular: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to understand these crimes and the discourse of insanity provides one way to do it,\u201d says Boucai. \u201cBut I think we can see where that sort of language is irresponsible and potentially undermines a just result.\u201d In other words, if a mass shooter is simply insane, then wholesale gun-law reform can, to some, seem unnecessary, even unwise. When bigotry is involved, that supposed insanity might, some who oppose Poussaint\u2019s ideas believe, undermine systemwide efforts toward equity\u2014or at least toward greater safety for those most likely to be targeted. In 1999, when Poussaint wrote his op-ed advocating for increased research into possible psychiatric treatments for extreme racism, he was the author of acclaimed books about the effects of racism on Black mental health and a veteran of public controversy. Years earlier he\u2019d argued publicly that racial pride among Black Americans could be taken to an unhealthy extreme. By the 1990s, he may have been best known for his work with Bill Cosby, consulting on scripts for The Cosby Show in a massively popular effort to disrupt stereotypes. Poussaint first published his ideas about extreme racism weeks after a man named Buford O. Furrow Jr. shot and seriously injured four children and an adult inside a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, then shot and killed a nearby Asian-American postal worker. When captured and ultimately convicted, Furrow told investigators his actions had been motivated by hate. Reporters unearthed information indicating that Furrow had close relationships with known white nationalists, and also that he had been evaluated by Washington State\u2019s mental-health system only months before the attack. He\u2019d even told officials after a previous arrest for assault that he\u2019d \u201cfantasized,\u201d about mass murder. To Poussaint, this story signaled a growing threat posed by a failure to recognize that, while highlighting and combating systemic racism is important in preventing discrimination, so is identifying and helping individuals motivated by bigotry who might go so far as to injure or kill others. Read more: 11 People Were Killed in 48 Hours in Mass Shootings Across America. It\u2019s Likely to Get Worse The idea had been brewing for years. In 1993, a Jamaican immigrant named Colin Ferguson had shot and killed six people and injured 19 aboard a New York commuter train after years of personal struggles that he blamed on white and Asian people, whom he referred to as \u201cdevils.\u201d Ferguson had been pinned down by passengers on the train to stop the shooting but, while defending himself at trial, he argued that someone else committed the crime. (Ferguson\u2019s lawyers had planned to argue that he was insane at the time, suffering from something called \u201cBlack rage,\u201d another condition debated but not officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association and that was the subject of a Law & Order episode.) After the train shootings, Poussaint\u2014a Haitian-American son of immigrants\u2014had noted Ferguson\u2019s trajectory: racist thinking, delusions that had come to dominate his life, then mass violence. This was a textbook case of extreme racism. \u201cExtreme racism crosses the line and is out of control,\u201d he explains. \u201cJust like somebody can have a little bit of anxiety, but if they have anxiety to the point that it is immobilizing, then it is a mental disorder.\u201d Mass shooters behind hate crimes are, as he sees it, in a similar state: \u201c[They] weren\u2019t functioning individuals. They were impaired by their mental pathology.\u201d When the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the guide that mental-health professionals use to make their diagnoses, was published in 1980, clinicians like Poussaint considered racism\u2014not extreme racism, but what he calls everyday racism\u2014a potential symptom of several conditions, from paranoid personality disorder to generalized anxiety disorder. Racism alone is not sufficient to diagnose a patient with one of those conditions, but an extreme racist, Poussaint says, likely suffers from delusions. Such people live with multiple symptoms including paranoia; they are likely to project negative traits or outcomes onto entire groups and sustain those beliefs even in the face of strong countervailing evidence. Many embrace conspiracy theories. Some may grow violent. In fact, Poussaint argued in a 2002 Western Journal of Medicine article, the extreme racist often begins with \u201cverbal expression of antagonism, progresses to avoidance of members of disliked groups, then to active discrimination against them, to physical attack, and finally to extermination (lynchings, massacres, genocide). That fifth point on the scale, the acting out of extermination fantasies, is readily classifiable as delusional behavior.\u201d Poussaint was not the first person to raise the idea that extreme racism is itself a mental illness. But he was among those leading the call for the American Psychiatric Association, publishers of the DSM, to consider putting it in subsequent editions of the manual, which has a long history of evolving, often slowly, in response to research and norms. When his op-ed ran, it seemed to Poussaint, people pounced. Some of his fellow Black psychiatrists argued that such a diagnosis would unleash a wave of legal excuse-making, helping no one but the violent racists themselves. Poussaint counters that other health diagnoses have yet\u2014nearly 200 years after psychological concerns officially entered American courtrooms\u2014to produce rafts of acquittals. And some clinicians and researchers argued that there are other ways of attacking racism besides treating it as an illness\u2014educational programs, diversity initiatives, policy changes. That\u2019s a point Poussaint says he doesn\u2019t oppose, at least when it comes to everyday racism. Those steps can help racists who embrace repugnant ideas while remaining functional parts of society. But those aren\u2019t the people he\u2019s talking about. \u201cRacism negatively impacts public health,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association told TIME in a statement. \u201cThe American Psychiatric Association has been focusing on this in the DSM by identifying and addressing the impact of structural racism on the over- or underdiagnosis of mental disorders in certain ethno-racial groups. From time to time we have received proposals to create a diagnosis of extreme racism but they have not met the criteria identified for creating new disorders.\u201d To this day, Poussaint believes that extreme racism is very likely its own disorder in need of study, possible diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment, he told me in September from his home in Massachusetts. But after retiring about 2\u00bd years ago at the age of 86, he says he\u2019s too far out of the professional mix to continue to push for an extreme racism diagnosis. I ask Poussaint what he thinks might have happened if extreme racism had become its own diagnosable condition listed in the DSM. Extreme racism might have been a topic on talk shows and a more frequent topic of news coverage, he says. With research and public information campaigns, the need for intervention could have been as clear as it is for heart attacks; the steps to do so as well-known as CPR. \u201cWe\u2019d get away from treating it as if [extreme racism] is normative,\u201d Poussaint says, \u201clike a cultural difference because America is a racist country. We have made it normative by not calling it what it is. Even people in general society, friends and relatives and even the afflicted individual, would recognize it as a disorder and say, \u2018I\u2019m not alright.\u2019 People who get swept up by anxiety and can\u2019t function, they don\u2019t think they are normal. They say, \u2018This is taking over my life. I need some help.\u2019 [A diagnosis] clues the family to say, \u2018This person is really troubled and we have to get them some help.\u2019\u201d \u2014with reporting by Solcyre Burga, Mariah Espada and Simmone Shah",

        "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 A Tel Aviv municipal patrol officer has died, Israeli officials said Saturday, after having been shot by a Palestinian on a street in central Tel Aviv. The suspect was then shot dead by another municipal patrol worker, Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai told Israel\u2019s public broadcaster. The Israeli police said in a statement that the shooter was a 27-year-old resident of the Palestinian town of Jenin in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian militant group Hamas praised the attack but did not take responsibility. The police officer was shot a day after a Palestinian teenager was killed in an attack by Israeli civilians on a Palestinian village in the West Bank. Washington has expressed concern over a growing number of attacks by Jewish settlers on Palestinian villages in the West Bank, where violence has worsened since last year with increased Israeli raids amid Palestinian street attacks on Israelis. Huldai said the municipal worker had approached the attacker after noticing something suspicious and was then fired at by the shooter. A second municipal worker then killed the shooter. \u201cWe are standing at a very sad incident,\u201d Huldai said. \u201cWe are praying for the well-being of the injured.\u201d In brief statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the actions of the municipal patrol officers. Despite the attack, tens of thousands protested in Tel Aviv, according to the Israeli public broadcaster, against the governing coalition\u2019s planned judicial overhaul which would see the highest court stripped of much of its powers. Proponents of the legislation say it would restore balance to the branches of government, while those against say it would remove checks on government powers. Last month, the coalition passed legislation that removed the court\u2019s power to strike down government actions based on an action's being classified as \u201cunreasonable.\u201d",

        "title": "After 3 lackluster matches, knockout play begins for U.S. World Cup team",
        "content": "MELBOURNE \u2014 Good has so far been barely good enough for the United States women\u2019s soccer team, as its quest to win a third straight World Cup has been marred by uncharacteristically mediocre play. The one-sided scores and dominating play that USWNT fans have come to expect have yet to materialize in two weeks of competition, prompting observers to wonder if U.S. command of women\u2019s soccer has come to an end. So U.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski said he fully understands the stakes ahead of America's knockout match Sunday against Sweden. \"I have to think if it\u2019s the most important game of my career, but it certainly is the most important game of the tournament,\" he told reporters Saturday in Melbourne. \"It\u2019s the knockout stage and there\u2019s no room for mistakes. So we have to be ready to be our best in this game.\" By failing to win Group E, the Americans are paying a heavy toll by having to face world No. 3-ranked Sweden in the round of 16 in Melbourne. The Swedes dominated Group G, outscoring their opponents, 9-1, in earning a date with the struggling Americans. In the goal-less Portugal match on Tuesday, in which the U.S. was saved by a goal post during a stoppage time shot, which could have done the unthinkable and sent the U.S. home in group play. \"There\u2019s no sugarcoating it, we had a bad game against Portugal and we are lucky we have moved on from that and are looking forward to this match,\" U.S. veteran Alex Morgan said. In wining once and drawing twice in group play, the United States has outshot Vietnam, the Netherlands and Portugal by a cumulative, 53-8, put more efforts on net, 19-1, and won more corner kicks, 26-2. As seemingly impressive as those numbers might be, they\u2019re down from America\u2019s three wins in 2019 group play, when the U.S. outshot Thailand, Chile and Sweden by a cumulative, 73-8, put more efforts on net, 32-4, and won more corner kicks, 30-3. The Americans will have to generate an attack Sunday without Rose Lavelle, who was suspended for the Sweden match after picking up a second yellow card. \u201cYou know, she\u2019s one of the best players in the world and not having her is definitely going to change the way we\u2019re, or at least some of the ways, we can approach the game,\u201d Andonovski said. \u201cBut in same time, we have a great roster with great players on the roster that are here for reasons for moments like this when they\u2019re ready and able to step in at any point in time.\u201d This upset-filled tournament has already seen the shocking early exits of Germany, Brazil and Canada and Morgan said she feels no joy seeing a trio of America's greatest challengers taken off the table. \"It\u2019s crazy tp see teams like Germany, Brazil, Canada, not making it to the knockout stage,\" Morgan said. \"And that just goes to show the growth of this game and and the fact that you know, you still want to continue to stay on top but you have to prove that time and time again you have to be able to show back tomorrow.\" Should the Americans crash out on Sunday, an exit in the round of 16 would mark the U.S. women\u2019s program\u2019s earliest elimination from competitive international play in memory. While winning world titles isn\u2019t a given, even for the dominant United States, the Americans have always come close to the pinnacle even when falling short. All of those American disappointments would pale in comparison to a U.S. elimination on Sunday. \"I think we hold ourselves to a high standard and I think within that the U.S. holds, and in the rest of the world holds, us to a high standard which is valid,\" Morgan said. \"I mean, we have been very successful for decades on this, in this, team. So we hold a high expectation for ourselves and we want to continue to prove ourselves right.\" Susan Archer and Molly Hunter reported from Melbourne and David K. Li from Los Angeles.",

Pakistani media and a Reuters witness described police surrounding Khan\u2019s residence in Lahore on Saturday after verdict was released. The sentence relates to an inquiry conducted by the election commission, which found Khan guilty of unlawfully selling state gifts during his tenure as prime minister from 2018 to 2022. Khan has denied any wrongdoing. The 70-year-old cricketer-turned-politician was accused of misusing his premiership to buy and sell gifts in state possession that were received during visits abroad and worth more than 140 million Pakistani rupees ($635,000).

        "content": "Greta Gerwig should be feeling closer to fine these days. In just three weeks in theaters, \u201cBarbie\u201d is set to sail past $1 billion in global ticket sales, breaking a record for female directors that was previously held by Patty Jenkins, who helmed \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d \u201cBarbie,\u201d which Gerwig directed and co-wrote, added another $53 million from 4,178 North American locations this weekend according to studio estimates on Sunday. The Margot Robbie-led and produced film has been comfortably seated in first place for three weeks and it\u2019s hardly finished yet. Warner Bros. said the film will cross $1 billion before the end of the day. In modern box office history, just 53 movies have made over $1 billion, not accounting for inflation, and \u201cBarbie\u201d is now the biggest to be directed by one woman, supplanting \u201cWonder Woman\u2019s\u201d $821.8 million global total. Three movies that were co-directed by women are still ahead of \u201cBarbie,\u201d including \u201cFrozen\u201d ($1.3 billion) and \u201cFrozen 2\u201d ($1.45 billion) both co-directed by Jennifer Lee and \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d ($1.1 billion), co-directed by Anna Boden. But, \u201cBarbie\u201d has passed \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d domestically with $459.4 million (versus $426.8 million), thereby claiming the North American record for live-action movies directed by women. New competition came this weekend in the form of the animated, PG-rated \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\u201d and the Jason Statham shark sequel, \u201cMeg 2: The Trench,\u201d both of which were neck-in-neck with Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d also in its third weekend, for the second-place spot. \u201cMeg 2\u201d managed to sneak ahead and land in second place. It overcame its abysmal reviews to score a $30 million opening weekend from 3,503 locations. The Warner Bros. release, directed by Ben Wheatley, currently has a 29% critics\u2019 score on Rotten Tomatoes and a B- CinemaScore from audiences. The thriller was released in 3D, which accounted for 22% of its first weekend business. Third place went to \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which added $28.7 million from 3,612 locations in North America, bringing its domestic total to $228.6 million. In just three weeks, the J. Robert Oppenheimer biopic starring Cillian Murphy has become the highest grossing R-rated film of the year (ahead of \u201cJohn Wick Chapter 4\u201d) and the sixth-biggest of the year overall, surpassing \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\u201d \u201cOppenheimer\u201d also celebrated a landmark, crossing $500 million globally in three weeks. Its worldwide tally is currently $552.9 million, which puts it ahead of \u201cDunkirk,\u201d which clocked out with $527 million in 2017, and has become Nolan\u2019s fifth-biggest movie ever. It\u2019s also now among the four top grossing biographies ever (company includes \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d and \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d) and the biggest World War II movie of all time. Paramount\u2019s \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d was close behind in fourth place with an estimated $28 million from 3,858 theaters in North America. Since opening on Wednesday, the film, which is riding on excellent reviews (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores, has earned $43.1 million. \u201cThis is one of those movies that is a multigenerational joy,\u201d said Chris Aronson, Paramount\u2019s president of domestic distribution. \u201cI think the enduring popularity of \u2018Turtles\u2019 is showing its true colors. And there hasn\u2019t been an animated film in eight weeks and there won\u2019t be another for eight weeks which is great for us.\u201d \u201cTurtles\u201d cost $70 million to produce and features a starry voice cast that includes Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd, Ayo Edebiri and Seth Rogen, who produced and co-wrote the film, which leans into the \u201cteenage\u201d aspect of the turtles. \u201cBarbie,\u201d \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and even the surprise, anti-trafficking hit \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d (now at $163.5 million and ahead of \u201cMission: Impossible 7\u201d) have helped fuel a boom at the box office, bringing in many millions more than was expected and helping to offset pains caused by some summer disappointments. \u201cAfter \u2018The Flash,\u2019 \u2018Indiana Jones\u2019 and, to a certain extent, \u2018Mission: Impossible,\u2019 people were saying the summer was a disappointment. But it\u2019s not over yet,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a summer that is going to go out on a high note.\u201d But the moment of triumph for the industry will likely be short lived if the studios can\u2019t reach an agreement with striking actors and writers soon. The fall release calendar has already gotten slimmer, with some studios pushing films into 2024 instead of trying to promote them without movie stars. Sony had planned to release its PlayStation-inspired true story \u201cGran Turismo\u201d in theaters nationwide next Friday, but will now be rolling it out slowly for two weeks before going wide on Aug. 25. The thinking? If movie stars can\u2019t promote the film, maybe audiences can. \u201cWe have to be realistic,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWe\u2019re on this emotional high of movies doing so well, but we have to temper our enthusiasm and optimism with the fact that the strike is creating a lot of uncertainty. The longer it goes on the more profound the issues become. But the audience has spoken and they love going to the movie theater.\u201d Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. \u201cBarbie,\u201d $53 million. 2. \u201cMeg 2: The Trench,\u201d $30 million. 3. \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d $28.7 million. 4. \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,\u201d $28 million. 5. \u201cHaunted Mansion,\u201d $9 million. 6. \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d $7 million. 7. \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part I,\u201d $6.5 million. 8. \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d $6.3 million. 9. \u201cRocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani,\u201d $1.5 million. 10. \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\u201d $1.5 million.",

        "title": "China's use of exit bans leaves Americans at risk of being arbitrarily detained",
        "content": "Sweeping \u201cexit bans\u201d and arbitrary detentions in China are having a chilling effect, among not just the Chinese diaspora with ties to their homeland but also international businesses increasingly anxious about operating there, Western experts and human rights watchdogs say. Under President Xi Jinping\u2019s decadelong rule, China has become more authoritarian by seeking to control many aspects of public life, from internet censorship and rewriting high school textbooks to imposing ideological crackdowns on the music and entertainment industries. The Chinese government rejects these characterizations. But for many people and businesses with links to China, operating there has only become more difficult. Its increased use of so-called exit bans and sweeping new counterespionage laws are creating a hostile environment for foreign business, according to experts. These changes have altered the life of one naturalized American citizen from Shanghai who asked not to be named to protect family and friends still living in China.  Before the pandemic lockdowns, he would travel to Shanghai every two years to visit his family and friends. But post-Covid things started to change, he said, and after a recent State Department advisory against traveling to China, combined with news reports about people being detained for no reason, he now thinks twice before booking a flight. \u201cBefore Covid we used to go there every other year. And every time we went back it changed so much, generally in the right direction. There were more people and the city was getting fancier,\u201d he said. \u201cBut since Covid, there were so many things that happened, especially the lockdown in Shanghai, and the political situation is very different.\u201d  He said he would return in the event of a family emergency but wants to avoid it if at all possible.  \u201cI don\u2019t just want to go back\u201d because officials can \u201cstop you for whatever and you cannot leave,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to be stopped, but there is a possibility and that\u2019s a concern, especially as I have a family here.\u201d It was against this backdrop that the State Department issued its advisory in late June, urging Americans to \u201creconsider travel\u201d to mainland China because of \u201carbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans, and the risk of wrongful detentions.\u201d U.S. citizens of Chinese descent \u201cmay be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment,\u201d the advisory reads, with officials potentially using these bans to pressure the family members of alleged dissidents abroad and gain leverage over foreign governments. Andrew Scobell, a distinguished fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, an independent Washington think tank funded by Congress, said China has \u201creally ratcheted up the intimidation and it\u2019s meant to cow people into silence.\u201d  \u201cBut it will have adverse effects, including intimidating people to the extent that they won\u2019t go back\u201d and \u201cintimidating CEOs and other business leaders,\u201d he added.  Part of the issue is that China does not recognize dual citizenship, creating complications for naturalized Americans of Chinese descent. Beijing believes the global Chinese population have a \u201cshared cultural background, irrespective of their nationality anywhere else\u201d and they \u201cowe a debt of cultural obligation to China,\u201d according to David Lampton, a professor emeritus at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. These people feel \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d to arbitrary action by China, which feels \u201cperfectly unconstrained to do with you what they want \u2014 irrespective of what other nationality documents you may hold,\u201d he said. People with \u201cdual travel documents don\u2019t necessarily know what the rules are,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can think you\u2019re subject to American consular protection and so on but that may in fact not be the case.\u201d This comes as relations between Washington and Beijing continue to cool off, with President Joe Biden characterizing his presidency as a U.S.-led democratic struggle against the autocracies, namely China. He and others want to \u201cde-risk\u201d their relationship with Beijing, in theory continuing lucrative trade but restricting some exports, such as microchips, while retaining the right to criticize China over human rights and other alleged malpractices. China frequently bristles at what it sees as foreign meddling and has denied the allegations made in the travel advisory. \u201cChina welcomes the people and businesses of all countries,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said when asked about it on July 10. \u201cWe are committed to protecting their safety and lawful rights and interests in China in accordance with the law, including their freedom of entry and exit.\u201d On the same day, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a warning to Chinese people in the U.S. \u201cThere have been frequent incidents of gun violence and discrimination against Asians in the United States,\u201d it said. It reminded \u201cChinese citizens in the U.S. to pay close attention to the local social security situation\u201d and \u201cbeware of falling into the tricks and traps of the U.S.\u201d  Human rights watchdogs and independent international analysts say the evidence suggests Beijing\u2019s protestations of innocence are unfounded. Since 2018, Xi\u2019s China has passed or amended five laws authorizing exit bans, bringing the total to 15, according to the Spain-based human rights group Safeguard Defenders. Mentions of exit bans have skyrocketed eightfold in China\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Court database, it said. These bans have been used for years to target Uyghurs, the mostly Muslim ethnic group that Washington and others say Beijing persecutes. But the bans' reach is widening, according to Safeguard Defenders, encompassing relatives of activists and \u201cso-called fugitives\u201d living outside of China, as well as \u201chuman rights defenders, businesspeople, officials and foreigners,\u201d the group said in an April report. These bans are often complex, vague and impossible to appeal, it said. Furthermore, on July 1, China updated its counterespionage law, broadening the definition of spying and banning the transfer of any data the government deems related to national security. Fear is rife within the international business community that this could be used to target anyone indiscriminately. Even before it was updated, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned in April that the law was \u201ca matter of serious concern for the investor community.\u201d It said in a statement that it cast \u201ca wide net over the range of documents, data or materials considered relevant to national security.\u201d This additional scrutiny \u201cdramatically increases the uncertainties and risks\u201d of doing business in China, it added. The reach of Xi\u2019s China does not end at its borders. In April, two people in New York were arrested on charges of operating an illegal Chinese police station, part of what Safeguard Defenders says is a global network to monitor dissidents that stretches to the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands, all of which have opened parallel investigations. China denies this, saying the facilities are volunteer-run sites assisting Chinese nationals with renewing driver\u2019s licenses and other services. This landscape risks mainland China going the way of Hong Kong, which saw an exodus of intellectuals and entrepreneurs when Beijing introduced a new national security law in 2020 that critics said eroded its historical freedoms. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just ideological suppression, it can be a tool in business relations gone sour,\u201d said Lampton at Johns Hopkins. Chinese officials \u201ccould snatch\u201d someone involved in a business deal \u201coff the street and say, \u2018You\u2019re not leaving until we\u2019ve resolved this.\u2019\u201d For the unnamed naturalized American citizen from China, all of this presents an uncertain future, with his homeland subject to the chaotic whims of geopolitics. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to get better, maybe in a year or two,\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends on what happens between the U.S. and China.\u201d",

Newsom's team Saturday slammed DeSantis' proposed rules for their debate on Fox News. \u201cWhat a joke,\" Newsom spokesman Nathan Click said in a statement in response to the proposal that DeSantis' team sent Fox News host Sean Hannity on Friday. \"Desantis\u2019 counterproposal is littered with crutches to hide his insecurity and ineptitude \u2014 swapping opening statements with a hype video, cutting down the time he needs to be on stage, adding cheat notes and a cheering section,\" Click said. \"Ron should be able to stand on his own two feet. It\u2019s no wonder Trump is kicking his ass.\u201d DeSantis' team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. DeSantis, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination, told Hannity on Wednesday that he would be willing to debate Newsom, a Democrat with whom he has frequently clashed over issues like guns, abortion, education and immigration. \u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m game. Let\u2019s get it done. Just tell me when and where. We\u2019ll do it,\u201d DeSantis said, agreeing to the debate idea that initially came about in June, when Hannity asked Newsom whether he'd debate DeSantis. Newsom sent a formal debate offer letter to Hannity last month that included rules such as that the debate would be moderated by Hannity, be broadcast live and be 90 minutes in length and that both governors wouldn\u2019t use notes. Newsom also proposed Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina as potential locations. In a letter to Hannity dated Friday, DeSantis' team offered its own rules, which diverged from some proposed by Newsom. Some of the differences: Hannity framed the event Wednesday as a \u201cpolicy-based debate\u201d between the heads of a red state and a blue state, but DeSantis has said the debate will be far more than that. \u201cThis is the debate for the future of our country,\" he told Hannity.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 North Korea has offered a very brief response to United Nations officials about an American soldier who dashed over the heavily-guarded border with South Korea last month and was taken into custody, the Pentagon said Tuesday. However, Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said that North Korea only acknowledged the U.N. Command\u2019s request for information about U.S. Army Private Travis King and stopped short of offering detailed information about him. \u201cI can confirm that the DPRK has responded to United Nations Command, but I don\u2019t have any substantial progress to read out,\u201d Ryder told a press conference, using the acronym of North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. When pressed, Ryder said that North Korea\u2019s message back to the U.N. Command was just \u201can acknowledgement\u201d of its inquiry. King sprinted into North Korea on July 18 while on a tour of the Demilitarized Zone on the border, landing the United States in a new diplomatic quandary with nuclear-armed North Korea. King, who joined the U.S. Army in January 2021, had served as a Cavalry Scout with the Korean Rotational Force, part of the decades-old U.S. security commitment to South Korea. But his posting was dogged by legal troubles. He faced two allegations of assault in South Korea, and eventually pleaded guilty to one instance of assault and destroying public property for damaging a police car during a profanity-laced tirade against Koreans, according to court documents. From May 24 to July 10 he served a sentence of hard labor at the Cheonan correctional facility in lieu of paying a fine, Yonhap news agency reported. After his release from the prison, which is designated for U.S. military members and other foreigners, King stayed at a U.S. base in South Korea for a week, Yonhap said. A Cheonan prison official confirmed King had served the hard labor sentence there, but declined to provide further information citing privacy concerns. U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said King had been due to face military disciplinary action on his return home to Fort Bliss, Texas. U.S. officials have expressed deep concern over King\u2019s fate in North Korea. The Army has noted the case of Otto Warmbier, a U.S. college student who was imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months and died shortly after he was returned to the United States in a coma in 2017.",

        "content": "MULTAN, Pakistan \u2014 A train derailed in southern Pakistan on Sunday, killing at least 30 people and injuring at least 60 others, officials said. Rescue operations were underway. Ten cars of a Rawalpindi-bound train derailed and some overturned, near the Pakistani town of Nawabshah, trapping many passengers, said senior railway officer Mahmoodur Rehman Lakho. Local television showed rescue teams extracting women, children and elderly passengers from damaged and overturned cars. Some of the injured were lying on the ground crying for help while locals gave out water and food. AP photos showed derailed train cars sprawled across or near the tracks. Senior police officer Abid Baloch said from the scene of the accident that 30 bodies had been recovered while more than 60 people were injured, some critically. He added that the death toll may rise as rescue operations continue. Baloch said women and children were among the dead and injured. Lakho, who is in charge of railways in the accident area, said rescue crews took injured passengers to the nearby People\u2019s Hospital in Nawabshah. He said the ill-fated Hazara Express was on its way from Karachi to Rawalpindi when 10 cars went off the tracks near the Sarhari railway station off Nawabshah. Mohsin Sayal, another senior railway officer, said train traffic was suspended on the main railway line as repair trains were dispatched to the scene. Sayal said alternative travel arrangements and medical care would be made available for the train\u2019s passengers. Railways Minister Khaja Saad Rafiq said the crash could be due to a mechanical fault or the result of sabotage. He said an investigation was underway. Train crashes often happen on poorly maintained railways tracks in Pakistan, where colonial-era communications and signal systems haven\u2019t been modernized and safety standards are poor.",

        "content": "Women in Texas with complicated pregnancies will be exempted from a state abortion ban under a temporary injunction issued on Friday, with the judge citing a lack of clarity on the ban\u2019s medical exemptions. Travis County District Court Judge Jessica Mangrum in her ruling sided with women and doctors who sued Texas over the abortion ban. \u201cThe Court finds that there is uncertainty regarding whether the medical exception to Texas\u2019 abortion bans \u2026 permits a physician to provide abortion care where, in the physician\u2019s good faith judgment and in consultation with the pregnant person, a pregnant person has a physical emergent medical condition,\u201d Mangrum said in the ruling. The temporary injunction will stand until the lawsuit against Texas is complete, unless a higher court intervenes. The injunction is expected to be appealed. The judge ruled that doctors cannot be prosecuted for application of \u201cgood faith judgment\u201d for provision of abortions for physical medical conditions including: those that pose infection risk or make pregnancy unsafe, where the fetus is not likely to survive the pregnancy after birth, and where a medical condition cannot be effectively treated during pregnancy or requires \u201crecurrent pervasive intervention.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s ruling alleviates months of confusion around what conditions qualify as medical emergencies under Texas\u2019 abortion bans, giving doctors permission to use their own medical judgment in determining when abortion care is needed,\u201d the Center for Reproductive Rights, the group that brought this lawsuit, said in a statement. Several women who said they were denied abortions despite grave risk to their lives sued the state of Texas in March, in the first apparent case of pregnant women suing over curbs imposed after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. The injunction is effective immediately. The judge set a trial date of March 25. Abortion was banned with very limited exceptions in Texas. The U.S. Supreme Court last year stripped away national abortion rights. State legislatures are wrestling with how much to restrict or expand abortion access after that decision.",

        "content": "COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy implied Saturday that U.S. involvement in the war in Ukraine may be because of President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden. \u201cThe purpose of the U.S. military [is] to advance American interests, to protect the homeland. Not to aimlessly fight some random war that\u2019s arguably a repayment for a private bribe that a family member of the United States received, $5 million from Burisma,\u201d Ramaswamy told a crowd of about 60 at a campaign event in Council Bluffs. Ramaswamy, who\u2019s crisscrossing Iowa in a bid to win the Republican nomination, has been highly critical of U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine on the trail.  \u201cWas the payment to Hunter Biden corrupt? Absolutely it was. Do I think that it has some relationship towards our posture toward Ukraine? I think it\u2019s likely that it does,\u201d Ramaswamy said.  Ramaswamy appeared to be referring to an alleged bribe involving the president and his son. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has claimed he was told by a whistleblower \u2014 whose claims are uncorroborated \u2014 about a tip regarding a $5 million payment from a foreign national to Joe Biden, then the vice president, and a family member \u201crelating to the exchange of money for policy decisions.\u201d  Republicans later identified the other family member as Hunter Biden, who at the time was an attorney and a board member of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.  The White House has denied the president had any participation in his son\u2019s business dealings. Devon Archer, a former business associate of Hunter Biden\u2019s, was questioned by the Republican-led House Oversight Committee on Monday. According to transcripts from the closed-door interview, Archer said the president\u2019s son used the Biden \u201cbrand\u201d to his advantage while he was working for Burisma.  He also testified that he had no knowledge of the president\u2019s having altered U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine to help his son.  Archer said that Hunter Biden would put his father on speakerphone in front of business associates at dinners but that the conversations centered on small talk like the weather.  Russia invaded Ukraine in the winter of 2022, years after Biden left Burisma\u2019s board. Since the invasion, the Biden administration and Congress have given billions of dollars of aid to Ukraine even though polls show the public is split over sending more money.  ",

        "title": "Delays in federal workers\u2019 comp can stall medical care, turning injuries into disabilities",
        "content": "Injured federal employees say their treatable injuries are at risk of progressing into lifelong disabilities because the workers' compensation program that covers their medical costs and procedures is clogged by low staffing, convoluted processes and an increase in claims. Workers and their advocates say filing a claim is a knotty experience of complicated paperwork and slow response times and, in some extreme cases, it can take years to get an approval. Joshua Lejeune, 33, is one of those workers. He needs surgery after injuring his knee while on patrol as a police officer at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Louisiana last year and is still waiting for approval. Since filing the workers' compensation claim in March 2022, he has been unable to safely carry his infant daughter up the stairs of his home. Because it's a workers' compensation case, his insurance won\u2019t cover his procedure and doctors are unable to work on his knee without an approved claim. The longer he waits, the more at risk he is for a complete knee replacement, he said doctors have told him.  \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Lejeune, who can\u2019t afford the $50,000 out-of-pocket estimate for the procedure and who has lost work and employment opportunities because of the injury. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete nightmare.\u201d And he isn\u2019t the only one experiencing this nightmare. The process has created delays for countless employees across the federal government\u2019s numerous agencies, union officials and labor attorneys said. From the Federal Bureau of Prisons to the U.S. Postal Service, federal workers and their advocates described a Byzantine process that they received little help to navigate. And while their doctors might tell them a procedure or scan is necessary, it can take weeks or months to receive approval from the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, or OWCP, an agency that falls under the Labor Department.  OWCP said it is working readily to remedy concerns. \u201cOWCP is deeply committed to providing federal workers injured or sickened on the job the benefits they\u2019re entitled to in a timely manner. The current administration has taken many actions to strengthen the FECA program and we will continue to find new ways to make the program work better for those filing a claim,\u201d OWCP Director Chris Godfrey said in a statement, referring to the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act. \u2018A tremendous problem\u2019 Joe Mansour, the workers' compensation specialist at the country\u2019s largest federal employee union, the American Federation of Government Employees, said he has been brought in to work on almost 1,000 cases since the start of the year because of delays and other issues. He emphasized that the union has contended with the problem under both Democrats and Republicans in the White House, but it grew particularly difficult under the Trump administration. \u201cMany federal employees I speak to say dealing with workers' comp is one of the most difficult things that they have ever experienced in the government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like the current administration is trying to improve things, but it remains a tremendous problem.\u201d The claims processing workforce shrank while Donald Trump was president, according to data provided by the Labor Department. One of the logjams potentially making the problem worse is that this smaller number of employees has had to tackle a larger number of cases.  The scale of the requests has grown precipitously. The FECA program received 182,303 new injury claims in fiscal year 2022, according to data provided by the Labor Department. That represents a 62% increase over 2013 when it received 112,807 claims.  In response, the Biden administration has increased staffing, hiring 281 new claims examiners and 55 medical treatment adjudicators to make the FECA program work better for claimants, according to the Labor Department data. Staffing levels are slowly climbing back to where they sat almost 10 years ago, and the agency said it has created new processes to escalate inquiries, simplified forms and hired an ombudsperson to investigate specific claims.   Still, claimants said the undertaking can become confrontational when they need to continually check in or involve lawyers to speed up the process. Claims are often denied by case workers, which can cause the entire effort to take much longer. And when it\u2019s a person\u2019s well-being on the line, union leaders and workers emphasized that a time-consuming approval process can take a cruel hold on people\u2019s lives, whether intentional or not.  \u201cIf a case is denied, we can appeal it \u2014 and we do well on appeals,\u201d said a union leader who asked to remain anonymous because the representative works regularly with the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs. \u201cWe get a lot of stuff overturned, but it takes months to do that, and time is not on the workers\u2019 side.\u201d Pete Hobart, 50, a power plant mechanic at the Dalles Dam, which is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the border between Washington and Oregon, hurt a disk in his back while working in February 2022. With little information on how to navigate the process, it took 10 months for him to obtain the approval for surgery.  \u201cNow my lower leg is numb,\u201d he said, adding he believes it is nerve damage caused by waiting for the workers\u2019 compensation approval. \u201cYou know when the doctor beats on your knee and your leg kicks? Mine doesn\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d The hardship of a slow process Federal employees say the process is very complicated and they receive little guidance to navigate the paperwork and requirements. Attorneys and union leaders who have been involved in helping to get claims processed said that delays are not an anomaly of just a few extreme cases but are affecting many claimants. To help members of his union, Mansour holds workshops at sites across the country and online for federal employees because so many people continue to struggle through the process. He has held more than 30 workshops this year, which included an online course last week attended by more than 160 employees.  \u201cAs of now, the agency just does not provide sufficient information to the injured employee,\u201d he said when asked about the need for the workshops. \u201cWhen an employee is injured, they\u2019re on their own.\u201d Two union representatives, each working for a different federal agency, said the problem is so pernicious that they sometimes advise members to file claims under their personal health insurance first and report the workers' compensation claim after they\u2019ve received the necessary help \u2014 or avoid the process altogether.  Attorneys who have worked on federal workers\u2019 compensation claims said that can be problematic, however, as it still requires individuals to come up with copays and deductibles out of pocket that they may not be able to get reimbursed afterward. It can also affect the evidence workers might need to gather to get claims approved.  \u201cPart of the problem in many cases is that once a claim is accepted, private insurance companies won\u2019t typically pay for treatment,\u201d said Aaron Aumiller, an attorney who has worked on federal workers' compensation cases for almost two decades. The wait can be emotionally excruciating, and it often takes an immense toll on individuals involved in the process. Multiple employees described spiraling in negative thoughts as they waited to get claims approved.  Jim Karney, 55, who works as a hydropower plant operator in Idaho, slipped on ice outside the Corps dam he worked at two days before Christmas 2021. The accident, which injured both his shoulders, was recorded by cameras at the plant. After filing an OWCP claim, he was unable to receive approval for an MRI until February 2022, and then only for his left shoulder. The following month his doctor told him that a torn rotator cuff had worsened and had permanently affected the muscle in his left shoulder. He was told that because of the delay, he will never be able to regain strength in his shoulder.  It took five more weeks to be approved for an MRI of his right shoulder, where another rotator cuff tear as well as a bicep tear were identified. Two and a half months later, he was able to get surgery on the right side. The injuries have limited his range of motion. They forced him to sleep in a recliner every night for months, and he still can\u2019t lift a gallon of milk with his left hand. The process, at times, has left him vacillating from tears of self-pity to intense anger and severe depression. He has just learned to cope with the pain emotionally. \u201cI never did feel suicidal, but I really wanted the pain to end,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t willing to go that far, but this process drives your mind that way.\u201d That's a familiar feeling for many, who said they're left to spiral in their pain without a sense of recourse. Lejeune, who quit the VA and is working in sales, said the process presumes that claimants know the workers' compensation program thoroughly. That assumption and his experience has him swearing off government work forever. \"I don't ever want to work for another government agency again,\" he said. \"When I was injured, I had zero help.

        "title": "If Trump committed 'a technical violation of the Constitution,' it's not a crime, his lawyer says",
        "content": "If former President Donald Trump committed a \u201ctechnical violation of the Constitution,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean he necessarily broke any criminal laws, John Lauro, Trump\u2019s criminal defense attorney, argued Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\" Lauro appeared to signal how he\u2019d defend the former president in a trial that will stem from the four-count criminal indictment returned last week by a federal grand jury that had been examining Trump\u2019s possible role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Pressed by NBC's Chuck Todd about Trump's alleged pressure campaign to get former Vice President Mike Pence to reverse the election, Lauro claimed that Trump and Pence had merely disagreed over whether a vice president could constitutionally take actions that could lead to a presidential election\u2019s being overturned. \u201cA technical violation of the Constitution is not a violation of criminal law,\" Lauro contended, saying it was \"just plain wrong\" to suggest that Trump had pressed Pence to break the law. \"And to say that is contrary to decades of legal statutes,\u201d he continued. \u201cThese kinds of constitutional and statutory disagreements don\u2019t lead to criminal charges,\" Lauro said. \"And one thing that Mr. Pence has never said is that he thought President Trump was acting criminally.\" In response to the latest indictment, Pence said he believes \"that anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States.\" He said Wednesday that Trump surrounded himself after the 2020 election with \u201ccrackpot lawyers\u201d who told him only what his \u201citching ears\u201d wanted to hear. \u201cI was fully prepared to make sure that we heard all the arguments and concerns the members of Congress had brought,\" Pence said. \"But because of the riot and because of \u2014 because of the assertion by the president and his crackpot lawyers that I could overturn the election, the violence that ensued eclipsed all of that.\" Pence elaborated on the subject Sunday, saying on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that Trump, \"from sometime in the middle of December\" 2020 \"began to be told that I had some authority to reject or return votes back to the states.\" \"I had no such authority,\" Pence said. \"No vice president in American history had ever asserted that authority, and no one ever should.\" In a follow-up email to NBC News, Lauro said he \"never said that President Trump committed a technical violation.\" Further previewing his defense, Lauro argued that Trump did nothing criminal because Trump believed that he\u2019d won the 2020 election and that the charges against him were a violation of his First Amendment rights to express that opinion. \u201cTrump believed in his heart of hearts that he had won that election, and, as any American citizen, he had a right to speak out under the First Amendment,\u201d Lauro said. The indictment acknowledges Trump\u2019s right under the First Amendment to \u201cspeak publicly about the election and even to claim, falsely, that there had been outcome-determinative fraud during the election and that he had won.\u201d He was also \u201centitled to formally challenge the results of the election through lawful and appropriate means,\u201d the indictment says, including through recounts and lawsuits. But it accuses Trump of going further and taking part in three criminal conspiracies: \u201cto defraud the United States by using dishonesty, fraud and deceit\u201d to obstruct the electoral vote process; to \u201cimpede the January 6 congressional proceeding at which the collected results of the presidential election are counted and certified\u201d; and to conspire \u201cagainst the right to vote and to have that vote counted.\u201d The allegation that Trump used \u201cdishonesty, fraud, and deceit\u201d to subvert the election with \u201cpervasive and destabilizing lies about election fraud\u201d came after a sprawling investigation in which dozens of White House aides and advisers ranging in seniority up to Pence testified. The indictment cited contemporaneous notes Pence took about meetings in which Trump pushed him to reject the Electoral College votes in multiple states. Democrats immediately pounced on Lauro\u2019s argument. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the Jan. 6 committee who was lead manager in Trump's second impeachment trial, slammed Lauro\u2019s argument as \u201cderanged\u201d and \u201ca grievous constitutional defense\" in a separate interview Sunday on \"Meet the Press.\" \u201cFirst of all, a technical violation of the Constitution is a violation of the Constitution. The Constitution in six different places opposes insurrection,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cOur Constitution is designed to stop people from trying to overthrow elections and trying to overthrow the government,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe conspired to defraud the American people out of our right to an honest election by substituting the real legal process we have under federal and state law with counterfeit electors,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cThere are people in jail for several years for counterfeiting one vote, if they try to vote illegally once. He tried to steal the entire election. \u201cThat is a deranged argument,\u201d Raskin said of Lauro\u2019s comments. At least one prominent Republican said Sunday that the charges didn't violate Trump\u2019s free speech rights. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a challenging case, but I don\u2019t think it runs afoul of the First Amendment,\u201d William Barr, who was Trump's attorney general, said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"From a prosecutor\u2019s standpoint, I think it\u2019s a legitimate case.\" Trump's actions, Barr said, went far beyond just expressing his opinion about the 2020 election. \u201cThis involved a situation where the states had already made the official and authoritative determination as to who won in those states and they sent the votes and certified them to Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe allegation, essentially, by the government is that at that point, the president conspired, entered into a plan, a scheme, that involved a lot of deceit, the object of which was to erase those votes, to nullify those lawful votes.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump said Sunday he'd seek a recusal for the judge assigned to his case, as well as a change of venue for a future trial, alleging that both the judge and the current trial location of Washington, D.C., would be unfair to him. \"There is no way I can get a fair trial with the judge 'assigned' to the ridiculous freedom of speech/fair elections case,\" Trump wrote in an all-capitalized post on his Truth Social platform. \"We will be immediately asking for recusal of this judge on very powerful grounds, and likewise for venue change.\"",

        "content": "A divided federal appeals court on Friday ruled that Mississippi cannot strip the right to vote from thousands of convicts after they complete their sentences, calling that a \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d that disproportionately affected Black people. A 2-1 panel of the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals faulted a provision of Mississippi\u2019s state constitution that mandates lifetime disenfranchisement for people convicted of a set of crimes including murder, rape and theft. Siding with a group of convicts who sued in 2018 to regain their right to vote, U.S. Circuit Judge James Dennis wrote that the state\u2019s policy violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishments. He said the state\u2019s constitutional provision, Section 241, served no legitimate purpose, ensures former offenders are never fully rehabilitated, and was adopted in 1890 after the U.S. Civil War to \u201censure the political supremacy of the white race.\u201d The provision, whose list of disqualifying crimes had been amended twice in the years, remained effective in achieving its \u201cracially discriminatory aim,\u201d Dennis said. Of the nearly 29,000 Mississippians convicted of disenfranchising offenses who had completed their sentences from 1994 to 2017, 58% were Black, he said. He said Mississippi was \u201cbucking a clear and consistent trend in our Nation against permanent disenfranchisement,\u201d he said, noting that 35 states plus Washington, D.C., today disavow the practice. Dennis was joined by U.S. Circuit Judge Carolyn Dineen King in reversing a lower-court judge\u2019s ruling. Both are appointees of Democratic presidents on the conservative-leaning court. \u201cThis is a major victory for Mississippians who have completed their sentences and deserve to participate fully in our political process,\u201d said Jonathan Youngwood, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit. A spokesperson for Republican Attorney General Lynn Fitch said she would appeal the decision, as \u201cthe Supreme Court has signaled that felon disenfranchisement is not punishment.\u201d In a dissenting opinion, U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Jones, an appointee of former Republican President Ronald Reagan, noted the U.S. Supreme Court in 1974 held that state laws permanently disenfranchising felons did not violate their equal protection rights under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 4th Amendment. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling disregards text, precedent, and common sense to secure its preferred outcome,\u201d Jones wrote.",

        "content": "Israeli police said Saturday that they arrested two Israeli settlers after they stormed a Palestinian village in the West Bank in a rampage that left one Palestinian dead. Armed settlers entered Burqa, a herding village east of the city of Ramallah, late Friday, shooting and killing 19-year-old Qusai Matan, Palestinian health officials said. Israeli media reported that one of the arrested settlers, who remained unnamed, used to work as an aide for a lawmaker of the far-right Israeli \u201cJewish Power\u201d party which is in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition of ultranationalist and ultraorthodox parties in the Israeli parliament. It includes Itamar Ben-Gvir, a pro-settlement firebrand known for hardline positions against Palestinians. The party couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Police said they arrested two settlers after detaining five for questioning. The other settler who was arrested was hospitalized after sustaining injuries Friday night. Authorities did not elaborate on the charges. The army said that Israeli settlers arrived in the area to herd sheep, leading to clashes between Israelis and Palestinians from the village. Both sides hurled rocks at each other, the army said, and Israelis fired at Palestinians, leaving Matai dead and four Palestinians and several Israelis injured by rocks. he village was closed down and more Israeli troops were stationed in the area surrounding it. Palestinian officials said the settlers also burned two cars in the village. They also called for the perpetrators to be punished. Violence has spiraled in the northern West Bank with the rise of shooting attacks by Palestinian groups against Israelis and daily arrest raids by the Israeli military, and growing attacks by extremist Jewish settlers. The surge in fighting is one of the worst between Israelis and Palestinians in nearly two decades. More than 150 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the start of 2023 in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Israel says most killed have been militants, but stone-throwing youths protesting army raids and innocent bystanders have also been killed. At least 26 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis so far this year. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. Palestinians seek those territories for their hoped-for independent state.",

Jessica Nu\u00f1ez made her plea in a video posted on the Facebook page \u201cFinding Alicia\u201d Sunday, thanking the public for their support over the past few years.  \u201cI can\u2019t even put into the words the amount of gratitude I have for you all,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that we know that Alicia is alive, I have to ask one more favor of you. I know you want answers, and I do too. But the public search for answers has taken a turn for the dangerous.\u201d Nu\u00f1ez said she has been harassed and her family has been attacked on the internet. \u201cThe public has gone from trying to help Alicia to doing things like trying to show up to her house and putting her safety in jeopardy,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez explained.  She asked the public to refrain from posting TikToks about her daughter and to stop reaching out to the teen or her family \u201cwith your speculations or questions or assumptions.\u201d   \u201cThis is not a movie, this is our life,\u201d the mother said, stressing she\u2019ll continue to protect her daughter.  \u201cFor this is my statement, there is an ongoing investigation, and I\u2019m begging you to move on,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez concluded. Navarro was 14 years old when she disappeared from the Phoenix area on Sept. 15, 2019. Now 18, she reported to a police station in a small Montana town near the Canadian border recently and identified herself as a missing person.   Nu\u00f1ez told NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d in 2020 that she had found a note in her daughter\u2019s bedroom saying she ran away, which she said was out of character. She added that her daughter was on the autism spectrum and could be shy or anxious in some social situations. Glendale Police spokesman Jose Santiago said at a news conference earlier this month: \u201cShe is by all accounts safe, she is by all accounts healthy, and she is by all accounts happy.\u201d \u201cShe is not in any kind of trouble. She is not facing any kind of charges,\u201d he added. Police Lt. Scott Waite said the case remains under investigation. Police did not immediately have details about how she arrived in Montana. \u201cEvery indication she\u2019s given to us so far is that she willfully left her home,\u201d Waite said. \u201cNow, the dynamics surrounding that decision are obviously something we\u2019re looking into.\u201d Officials said she arrived at the police station by herself. Santiago said she \u201cbasically asked for help to clear her off of a missing juvenile list.\u201d Police shared a videoclip Thursday showing the moment Navarro told authorities no one had hurt her. When police announced Navarro was found, they said she had been reunited with her mother \u201celectronically.\u201d Santiago said: \u201cShe wanted to talk to her mom, and she wanted to make sure her mother knew she was OK.\u201d",

He said that a \u201cguided air bomb\u201d had hit the blood transfusion center in the northeastern city of Kupiansk. In a separate post on his own Telegram channel, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said initial reports suggested two men had died and another four were injured in the \u201clarge scale fire.\u201d Houses and farm buildings were also damaged, he said, adding that residential housing and other agricultural buildings had also been struck in nearby villages. NBC News could not independently verify the claims, and Russia has repeatedly denied deliberately targeting civilians in what it calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, although Western leaders and Ukraine\u2019s armed forces estimate thousands of people, both military members and civilians, have been killed and that millions more have been displaced.    The city of Kupiansk and its outlying settlements are in Kharkiv, which were seized by Russian troops in the early days of Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  The area was liberated during a Ukrainian counteroffensive in September but has since come under heavy shelling and attacks.  Elsewhere, the Moscow-appointed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said in a Telegram post that the Chongar Bridge, which links the peninsula to the Russian occupied Ukrainian mainland, had been hit with a \u201cmissile strike.\u201d \u201cOne hit, some of the missiles were shot down by air defense forces,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is damage to the roadbed of the automobile bridge, repair work is already beginning. There are no victims.\u201d Farther north, Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-installed mayor of the city of Donetsk said a fire had broken out at the University of Economics and Trade after 40 missiles were fired in its vicinity. Alexei Kostrubitsky, the Russian-installed Donetsk regional emergency minister, told Reuters that Ukrainian forces had used cluster munitions in the shelling, which had caused the fire. NBC News could not verify these claims, but both sides have used cluster munitions over the course of the invasion.  The intense overnight fighting came as officials from 40 different countries, including the U.S. and China, met in Jeddah to begin Ukraine-organized peace talks seeking to find a way to start negotiations over Russia\u2019s war on the country. Ukrainian and Western diplomats hope that the senior officials from countries across both the global North and South will agree on key principles for a future peace settlement to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Russia was not invited. The renewed global push to peace comes as Russia exited a Turkey and U.N.-backed deal in July allowing for the safe export of Ukrainian grain, causing a jump in global food prices.",

Dr. Krystal Cascetta, an oncologist at Mount Sinai Hospital, shot her baby and then herself at their home in Somers, a town about 50 miles northeast of New York City, around 7 a.m., New York State Police said. State police said that \"the scene is consistent with a murder/suicide.\" It is unclear how old the baby was. Trooper Steven Nevel said he was not permitted to release more details but said: \"We know, 100%, without a doubt, that it was a murder-suicide.\" Nevel said the 911 call came from someone inside the residence, who, upon hearing the first gunshot, rushed to the baby's room, thinking something had fallen. The unidentified caller heard a second gunshot before arriving at the room, broke down the locked door and found the dead mother and baby inside, Nevel said. According to Mount Sinai's website, Cascetta treated breast, bone, gynecological and gastrointestinal cancers. She worked as site chief of the Mount Sinai Queens Infusion Center, a treatment center for cancer and blood disorders, and as an assistant professor of medicine in the hematology and medical oncology division at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Cascetta graduated from Albany Medical College, where she was inducted into a national honor society \"for demonstrating excellence in humanistic clinical care, leadership, compassion and dedication to service,\" according to her Mount Sinai webpage. She had also been studying for a master of health administration degree at Cornell University as of last year.

Porcha Woodruff, 32, was getting her two children ready for school on the morning of Feb. 16 when six police officers showed up at her doorstep and presented her with an arrest warrant alleging robbery and carjacking. Woodruff initially believed the officers were joking given her visibly pregnant state. She was arrested. \"Ms. Woodruff later discovered that she was implicated as a suspect through a photo lineup shown to the victim of the robbery and carjacking, following an unreliable facial recognition match,\" court documents say. The robbery victim told police that on Jan. 29 he met a woman whom he had sexual intercourse with. At some point in the day, they went to a BP gas station, where the woman \"interacted with several individuals,\" according to the lawsuit. They then left for another location, where the victim was robbed and carjacked at gunpoint by a man whom the woman had interacted with earlier at the BP gas station. The victim told police his phone was returned to the gas station two days later. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for Eastern Michigan, names Detective LaShauntia Oliver, who was assigned to the case, as a defendant. When Oliver learned that a woman had returned the victim's phone to the gas station, she ran facial technology on the video, which identified her as Woodruff, the lawsuit alleges. \"Detective Oliver stated in detail in her report what she observed in the video footage, and there was no mention of the female suspect being pregnant,\" the lawsuit says. When a man was arrested driving the victim's car on Feb. 2, Oliver failed to show him a picture of Woodruff, according to court documents. The victim was also shown a lineup of potential suspects and identified Woodruff as the woman he was with when he was robbed. Oliver used an eight-year-old picture of Woodruff in the lineup from an arrest in 2015, despite having access to her current driver's license, according to the lawsuit. On the day Woodruff was arrested, she and her fianc\u00e9 urged officers to check the warrant to confirm whether the woman who committed the crime was pregnant, which they refused to do, the lawsuit alleges. Woodruff was charged with robbery and carjacking and released from the Detroit Detention Center at around 7 p.m. on $100,000 personal bond. Her fianc\u00e9 took her to a medical center, where she was diagnosed with a low heart rate due to dehydration and was told she was having contractions from stress related to the incident. On March 6, the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office dropped the case for \"insufficient evidence,\" according to the lawsuit. Detroit Police Chief James E. White said he reviewed the allegations in the lawsuit, which he said are \"very concerning.\" \"We are taking this matter very seriously, but we cannot comment further at this time due to the need for additional investigation,\" he said in a statement. \"We will provide further information once additional facts are obtained and we have a better understanding of the circumstances.\" Oliver did not respond to requests for comment.",

        "content": "LONDONDERRY, N.H. \u2014 The events of Jan. 6 took center stage Friday at Mike Pence\u2019s first campaign event after his former running mate pleaded not guilty to charges that he engaged in criminal conspiracies aimed at overturning the 2020 presidential election. As soon as the former vice president arrived at the American Legion Hall in Londonderry, New Hampshire, he encountered about 10 pro-Trump protesters carrying flags and signs. \u201cThere\u2019s the sellout! There\u2019s the traitor!\u201d they yelled at Pence as he exited his vehicle. \u201cWhy\u2019d you sell out the people?\u201d There was no violence, and Pence did not engage with the supporters of his rival for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. At the town hall, Pence tried to court the protesters. \u201cI know the people in this movement, whether they support me or not, are the best people in this country,\u201d he said as he pointed to the protesters in the corner of the room. In response to a question about the potential for further violence from Trump supporters in the wake of Jan. 6, Pence said he rejected that notion \u201ccategorically.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you there is a lot of passion out there, but I just, I reject your suggestion that that passion is translated into the violence and vandalism of that day,\u201d he said. Pence's role on Jan. 6, when some rioters chanted \"Hang Mike Pence,\" has been thrust back into the spotlight following Tuesday's indictment of former President Donald Trump. In that document, federal prosecutors said Pence kept \u201ccontemporaneous notes\u201d about meetings and conversations he had with Trump leading up to Jan 6. The indictment also said that the president and a co-conspirator now known to be lawyer John Eastman asked Pence to use his authority as president of the Senate on Jan. 6 to either reject certain states\u2019 electors or send them back to their state legislatures. On Friday night, one town hall participant, Mary Bartel of Windham, asked Pence why he didn't go along with that plan. Pence explained, as he has previously to other skeptical voters, that he did not have the authority to overturn the election. He also told her to write down and look up \u201cArticle Two, Section One, Clause Three\u201d of the Constitution. \u201cI will,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "VAIL, Iowa \u2014 Vivek Ramaswamy suggested canceling Juneteenth, calling it a \u201cuseless\u201d holiday in a conversation with Iowa voters Saturday.  Less than two months ago, however, he posted a video on social media celebrating the day.  Breaking down his plan Saturday to institute a national voting holiday, Ramaswamy, a GOP presidential candidate, proposed making space for the new holiday by canceling an old one.  \u201cCancel Juneteenth or one of the other useless ones we made up,\u201d Ramaswamy told an applauding crowd gathered at a welding company here. Asked by NBC News to clarify whether he thought Juneteenth was a \u201cuseless\u201d holiday, Ramaswamy said, \u201cI basically do.\u201d  Less than two months ago, on Juneteenth itself, he spoke differently about the celebration.  \u201cWe don\u2019t just look back and flog ourselves,\u201d Ramaswamy said in the video June 19, which was posted to his account on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.   \u201cWhat we celebrate is how far we\u2019ve come. And as a first-generation American myself, you better believe I\u2019m proud of it. Happy Juneteenth everybody,\u201d he said.  When NBC News asked Ramaswamy on Saturday whether he believed Veterans Day or Memorial Day were also useless holidays, he said he didn\u2019t.  \u201cI stand with the presumption of time-tested traditions,\u201d he said.   While Juneteenth became a federal holiday only in 2021, it has been observed since 1866. In 2004, President George W. Bush issued a statement commemorating the holiday. On Saturday, Ramaswamy called the Juneteenth holiday \u201credundant,\u201d saying it overlapped with other holidays, like Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Presidents Day. Yet Juneteenth celebrates something completely different. As the National Museum of African American History and Culture notes, Juneteenth celebrates the anniversary of when Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, and announced a quarter-million Black people had been freed by executive decree.   \u201cThe reason for making it a holiday was under political duress. It was a political hostage situation on the back of the death of George Floyd,\u201d Ramaswamy said.  One of his competitors, former Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, who is biracial, criticized Ramaswamy for saying he \"hopes to cancel a holiday that celebrates equality and freedom.\" \"His gimmicks and shtick aren\u2019t serious,\" Hurd said. On Juneteenth two months ago, the NAACP issued a statement saying, \u201cToday we celebrate our emancipation while also acknowledging that we are still fighting for true freedom.\u201d  ",

        "title": "The heaviest animal ever? Ancient whale found in Peru desert",
        "content": "A giant whale that lived almost 40 million years ago is now thought to be the heaviest animal that has ever lived, scientists said Wednesday. The Perucetus colossus \u2014 meaning the colossal whale from Peru \u2014was even bigger than the current heavyweight champion, the blue whale, according to an article published in the journal \u201cNature.\u201d The newly revealed findings were based on fossils found in the Peruvian desert more than 10 years ago, but only just identified as a previously unknown species. At 66 feet in length, the colossus isn\u2019t the biggest or longest creature to have lived in the seas, since blue whales can grow to a gargantuan 100 feet long. But the newly discovered sea mammal\u2019s sheer bulk and its bone density means it was probably the heaviest and could have weighed between 94 tons (85 metric tons) and 375 tons (340 metric tons), the study said. The biggest blue whales ever observed weigh an estimated 200 tons (180 metric tons). \u201cThe estimated skeletal mass of P. colossus exceeds that of any known mammal or aquatic vertebrate,\u201d the journal article said, adding that this makes it \u201ca contender for the title of heaviest animal on record.\u201d \u201cThe body mass of this ancient cetacean may have been ... almost twice that of the largest blue whales and more than three times that estimated for Argentinosaurus, one of the largest dinosaurs ever found,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Giovanni Bianucci, from the University of Pisa in Italy, in a press release. An international team of scientists spent years digging in the Ica desert along the southern coast of Peru, an area that was once underwater and is famed for its paleontological discoveries. Eventually they uncovered and extracted 13 vertebrae, four ribs and a hip bone. Each vertebrae would have weighed more than 220 pounds. This posed quite a challenge for the research team, who struggled not only to lift the bone fossils but to fully analyze them via the usual methods. Instead they used pioneering structured light scanning to make a three-dimensional model of them and drilled inside. This allowed them to estimate the whale's size and weight despite having an incomplete skeleton. Dating of volcanic ash at the site means the team could date the species to between 39.8 and 37.84 million years ago, in the Eocene epoch. At that point other members of the cetacean family \u2014 which includes dolphins and whales \u2014 were still \u201cabandoning the terrestrial lifestyle in favor of a marine one,\u201d said Elisa Malinverno, a member of the research team. The Perucetus colossus may have used its heavy skeleton as a ballast to roam around the ocean floor, feeding along the seabed like modern-day sea cows and some sharks, the study said. \u201cIt\u2019s just exciting to see such a giant animal that\u2019s so different from anything we know,\u201d said Hans Thewissen, a paleontologist at Northeast Ohio Medical University who had no role in the research, according to the Associated Press. The Ica desert, one of the driest places on Earth, is also where scientists found the oldest known four-legged cetacean to reach the Pacific Ocean and the earliest ancestor of the modern baleen whales.",

        "title": "33 officer arrests in 3 years: Sheriff asks 'What are we doing wrong?'",
        "content": "Richard Roundtree, the sheriff of Richmond County, Georgia, has a problem: More than 30 of his sworn officers have been arrested over the past three years, mostly on charges of smuggling drugs or items into the county jail or assaulting inmates. \u201cWe ask ourselves, \u2018What are we doing wrong? What more can we be doing?\u2019\u201d Roundtree said in June after announcing the arrest of a jailer on charges that he passed synthetic marijuana to a detainee.  In some ways, the crisis in Richmond County reflects a dilemma facing many of America\u2019s county jails, where people accused of crimes are held before trial or serve short sentences. Across the country, jails are overcrowded and understaffed, experts, inmates and workers say,  making conditions worse for both detainees and guards. The arrests in Richmond County may be a result of those factors, although Roundtree has said that he\u2019s still trying to figure out why there have been so many officers charged with crimes \u2014 and how to curb the misconduct. \u201cAre we missing something in the hiring process? Are we not providing enough training?\u201d Roundtree said at the news conference. \u201cAll of these issues have been exhaustively addressed and discussed and yet misconduct is still occurring despite the fact that deputies are consistently being arrested and losing their careers.\u201d He added: \u201cThe only constant truth we have been able to detect is monetary gain. It simply appears to be all about the money.\u201d Roundtree\u2019s office declined a request for an interview or to answer written questions, referring NBC News to his prior public statements. The sheriff, who says his staff numbers about 700, said it would help if the county commission gave him more money to boost salaries. Payroll records show that jailers earn on average $42,500 a year, and road patrol deputies earn an average of $46,500. Low pay, Roundtree has said, makes it difficult to recruit and keep good people, and makes it more tempting to smuggle drugs or other items in exchange for cash. But Richmond County-Augusta Commission member Wayne Guilfoyle said money is not an excuse. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing this illegal activity has nothing to do with pay; it\u2019s a character flaw in the person,\u201d Guilfoyle said. \u201dI think he needs to raise his standards on the quality of people he\u2019s hiring.\u201d Roundtree has said that he is exploring \u201cenhanced vetting\u201d of recruits, including more robust background checks, and expanding training and access to in-house counselors to try to curb misconduct.  \u201cWe are going to have to put something in place enforcing our core values, what kind of agency we want to be and what won\u2019t be tolerated,\u201d Roundtree said in a March news conference. Documents obtained through public records requests show that most of the 33 arrests involved contraband, or assaulting or having sex with inmates. Thirteen arrests involved a range of allegations of on-duty and off-duty misconduct, including domestic violence and driving while intoxicated. All 33 were fired or resigned after their arrests. Four cases involving alleged assaults of inmates were dropped after grand juries declined to indict the officers; one of those officers has since gotten his job back and another now works for a nearby police department.  Most of the cases are still pending in court, records show. Two officers have been sentenced to probation, one for charges related to smuggling, the other for sexual battery against a detainee.  Lawyers who have represented people held in this jail said in interviews that there aren\u2019t enough staff, and many of those who work there are inexperienced and stressed out. \u201cThe problem is that they have a hard time finding people, and when they\u2019re understaffed they\u2019re giving responsibilities to people who have not been battle-tested long enough,\u201d said Jack Batson, a lawyer in Augusta.   Another lawyer, Tanya Jeffords, said 33 arrests in three years indicate that problems in the jail have gotten too serious to overlook. \u201cPoor treatment of inmates in jail is systemic, but most of the time a rug is thrown over it,\u201d Jeffords said. \u201cAt this point it\u2019s gotten so bad that the rug had to be pulled back.\u201d",

        "content": "Actor Paul Reubens, who came to fame in the 1980s as children's TV star Pee-wee Herman, has died years after a cancer diagnosis, his team said Monday. He was 70. \"Last night we said farewell to Paul Reubens, an iconic American actor, comedian, writer and producer whose beloved character Pee-wee Herman delighted generations of children and adults with his positivity, whimsy and belief in the importance of kindness,\" according to a statement posted to his Facebook. \"Paul bravely and privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit. A gifted and prolific talent, he will forever live in the comedy pantheon and in our hearts as a treasured friend and man of remarkable character and generosity of spirit.\" It had not been previously disclosed that Reubens was diagnosed with cancer. The announcement of his death included a personal statement from the actor, explaining why he had kept his medical condition under wraps. \u201cPlease accept my apology for not going public with what I\u2019ve been facing the last six years,\" he wrote. \"I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you.\u201d Reubens rocketed to fame for creating the sarcastic but good-natured man-child Pee-wee Herman, a character whose red bowtie and sneering catch phrases \u2014 \u201cI know you are, but what am I?\u201d \u2014 were ubiquitous in the \u201880s and early \u201890s. Pee-wee was the star of a Los Angeles stage play produced by Reubens that gained enough of a following that HBO recorded and broadcast a performance in 1981.  That eventually led to Reubens\u2019 big break, the 1985 movie \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure,\u201d helmed by first-time feature film director Tim Burton. The movie followed Pee-wee\u2019s surreal and slapstick journey to find his missing bicycle and, while a modest box office hit, became a cult favorite. The success of \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure\u201d led to Reubens landing a Saturday morning CBS show, \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d The live action show was a hit with kids and adults alike and ran from 1986 to 1991. But Reubens' rise to fame was halted in 1991 after he pleaded no contest to indecent exposure at an adult movie theater in Sarasota, Florida. Then in 2004, Reubens was sentenced to three years probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor obscenity charge involving photographs of minors engaged in sexual conduct that were seized from him. Those brushes with the law dented but didn't derail Reubens' career. He returned to the big screen following the indecent exposure incident with a cameo as the Penguin's father in Burton's 1992 blockbuster sequel, \"Batman Returns.\" That same year, he fully shed his Pee-wee persona by playing a snarling blood-sucker in the \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" film. Reubens won critical acclaim in 2001 for playing a drug-dealing hairdresser in the movie \"Blow,\" starring alongside Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp. His TV credits included appearances on \"30 Rock,\" \"The Blacklist\" and \"Gotham.\" The Groundlings improv and sketch comedy theatre, where Reubens got his start as a performer and invented his iconic alter ego, said in a statement on Monday it was deeply saddened by his passing. \"As an iconic member of The Groundlings in the 1970-80s, Paul created his infamous character of Peewee Herman here, which became a cultural phenomenon that spanned decades,\" the theater said. \u201cPaul\u2019s contributions to comedy and entertainment have left a lasting impact on the world, and he will be greatly missed by all in the Groundlings community. We love you, Paul.\u201d  \"Paul Reubens was like no one else \u2014 a brilliant and original comedian who made kids and their parents laugh at the same time,\" late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel said in a statement. \"He never forgot a birthday and shared his genuine delight for silliness with everyone he met. My family and I will miss him.\" Comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien recalled \"the magic, generosity, artistry, and devout silliness of Paul Reubens.\" \"Everyone I know received countless nonsensical memes from Paul on their birthday, and I mean EVERYONE,\" O'Brien said in a statement. \"His surreal comedy and unrelenting kindness were a gift to us all. Damn, this hurts.\" \"Orange Is the New Black\" and \"Poker Face\" star Natasha Lyonne credited Reubens with launching her career, thanks to a recurring role on \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\" when she was a child actor. \"Love you so much, Paul,\" Lyonne wrote on social media. \"One in all time. Thank you for my career & your forever friendship all these years & for teaching us what a true original is.\"",

        "content": "Less than a minute into the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team\u2019s (USWNT) World Cup opening against Vietnam on Friday night, American forward Trinity Rodman fell to the turf. A Vietnamese defender swiped her leg going for a ball. For a moment, the young star\u2019s World Cup debut looked like it would be maddeningly brief. Megan Rapinoe started to stretch, getting ready to replace Rodman. After receiving some treatment on the sideline, however, Rodman came back into the game. But the Golden Star Women Warriors were sending an unsubtle message: Vietnam was not going to roll over. The Warriors would play rough, would play sharp defense, and refuse to give up double-digit goals. This would assuredly be no repeat of 2019, when the U.S. beat Thailand 13-0. The U.S. still won the game fairly easily, 3-0. Sophia Smith\u2014another World Cup rookie member of the generation of forwards carrying the USWNT into the future but making their mark in the present\u2014turned in a spectacular debut, scoring two first-half goals and assisting on the third. The first breakthrough came in the 14th minute, when Alex Morgan flicked a beautiful pass to Smith, who was streaking down the left side of the field and fired a shot through the legs of Vietnam keeper Thi Kim Thanh Tran. Then in the first-half stoppage time, Kim Thanh mishandled a saveable Smith shot; it was a rare error from Kim Thanh, who made several nice saves and blocks in a valiant effort. Sign up for \u2018Extra Time,\u2019 our new newsletter that will break down the biggest moments from the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup Vietnam was playing to keep the game close. It put all their players back on defense, so the USWNT faced a sea of red jerseys almost every time it had possession. The Golden Star Women Warriors\u2019 offense was, well, non-existent. The USWNT\u2019s defensive back line didn\u2019t face much of an attack: Julie Ertz moved up front for a few scoring chances, but for the most part, she could have spent 90 minutes FaceTiming her son Madden, who\u2019s almost a year old and in New Zealand. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naher did not face a single shot. She could have enjoyed a Speight\u2019s or two. The Americans could have easily pumped in more goals: missed chances are a legitimate concern coming out of this game, as future opponents are expected to be more of a challenge. Aside from her assist to Smith, Morgan was a bit off her game. She missed a penalty shot in the first half, when the U.S. was up a goal. And at the start of the second half, a Rodman cross landed right on the foot of midfielder Linsey Horan, who shanked the opportunity. But Horan made up for it later on. In the 77th minute, Ertz lobbed a nifty ball that Smith chased down on the right wing. Tran left her line to challenge Smith, who crossed it to Horan about 12 yards in front of goal. She fired the shot in to make it 3-0. Megan Rapinoe made her 200th appearance in a U.S. uniform, when she replaced Morgan in the 61st minute. In the 71st minute, midfielder Rose Lavelle, who like Rapinoe has been fighting injuries coming into this World Cup and came in as a second-half sub, set Rapinoe up for a valedictory goal. (Rapinoe is playing in her last World Cup). But Rapinoe sent the shot high. Horan sorta laughed Rapinoe\u2019s error\u2019s off. Rapinoe, still competing at 38, just looked ticked. In all, the Americans took care of business. The USWNT avoided any kind of disaster on the scoreboard, or with injuries. They got the win and the 3 points. The final tally wasn\u2019t a laugher, but the Americans dominated the game. The USWNT will now face the Netherlands, the 2019 World Cup runners-up, on Wednesday. The quest for history\u2014a third straight World Cup\u2014remains on track.",

        "title": "Bereavement Camps Help Kids Affected by Suicide Grieve",
        "content": "One by one, children toss notecards into the flames, each one bearing the name of a loved one lost to suicide: fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters. Each card makes the fire burn a little brighter, a burst of light and memory as the paper singes and crumples. When each child has had their turn, they embrace in a group hug\u2014some crying, some smiling, together in both grief and healing. Tomorrow, the 72 children, teens, and young adults attending Comfort Zone Camp\u2019s three-day suicide-bereavement camp in rural New Jersey, as well as the parents who accompanied them and the \u201cbig buddies\u201d with whom the kids are paired, will pack up and return home. The hope is they\u2019ll leave feeling emotionally lighter than when they arrived, says Lynne Hughes, who founded Comfort Zone Camp more than 20 years ago to give grieving children a place to open up and heal from their losses. \u201cIf you never tell your story, grief doesn\u2019t go anywhere; it just hangs out on your shoulder with you,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cIf you tell your story, it de-powers it. You\u2019re going toward it. Mourning is the intentional act of going toward the grief.\u201d Hughes didn\u2019t start her organization specifically to help people dealing with suicide loss; it also offers free bereavement camps for kids who have lost loved ones to any cause. But the need for suicide-specific support has grown at both Comfort Zone Camp and in the wider network of U.S. bereavement camps in recent years. Attendance at Comfort Zone Camp\u2019s suicide-bereavement camp rose by about 50% from 2022 to 2023. That growing demand coincides with rising U.S. suicide rates, which increased by about 37% from 2000 to 2021. Almost 50,000 people in the U.S. died by suicide in 2021, leaving behind a devastating multiple of grieving loved ones\u2014many of them children. The bereavement-support organization Judi\u2019s House estimates that more than 450,000 U.S. children will lose a parent to suicide by the time they turn 18. Short sleepaway camps have emerged as a unique way to support children and families grieving these losses. Out in the woods, campers can tell their stories, bond with people who understand their pain, and feel like kids again through activities like boating, crafts, archery, and roasting marshmallows. \u201cYou make lifelong friendships at camp because you meet somebody that doesn\u2019t exactly know what you\u2019re going through, but they\u2019ve been through it in a different way,\u201d says Tess Wenger, 15, who started attending Comfort Zone Camp after her then-11-year-old sister died by suicide. \u201cYou feel as though you can talk to somebody about it and you won\u2019t feel judged like in the \u2018normal,\u2019 outside world.\u201d Some people who balk at traditional talk therapy find it easier to open up during activities like nature walks, yoga classes, and bonfires\u2014particularly with the knowledge that they\u2019re around people who intimately understand what they\u2019re going through, says Kaitlin Daeges, volunteer executive director at the Livin Foundation, which established a suicide-bereavement camp in Minnesota in 2019. Bereavement camps, which tend to be free, may also be more accessible than traditional mental-health care. Bridie Croucher struggled to find a therapist with immediate availability for her 10-year-old son, Oscar, after he started asking questions about his father\u2019s death by suicide, which happened when the boy was two-and-a-half. Facing a six-month-long waitlist for care, she enrolled him in Comfort Zone\u2019s suicide-loss camp \u201cto help bridge that gap,\u201d and says she\u2019s since noticed a huge difference in his ability to process and cope with his feelings. Sydney, Morgan, and Isaiah Mosher know first-hand how important it is to offer kids a place to heal when they need one. Their father died by suicide when they were teenagers. The family barely talked about their loss, Sydney says, which only prolonged the pain\u2014so as adults, she and her siblings decided to open Camp Kita, a free suicide-bereavement camp in Maine. Camp Kita hosted five campers in its first season 10 years ago; this year, it had to cap enrollment at 75 and limit the waitlist. Demand is so high that the founders are raising money to construct permanent campgrounds. They hope to offer year-round programming, including multiple camp sessions; retreats for groups at increased risk of suicide, such as veteran families and LGBTQ+ youth; mental-health trainings; nature-therapy programs; and more. Daeges, whose father died by suicide when she was 12, says rising demand for these services underscores their dual purposes: to serve families who are already part of the \u201cunfortunate club\u201d of suicide bereavement, and to prevent others from joining it. \u201cCamp is both reactive and preventive at the same time,\u201d Daeges says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to support these families and the people left behind\u2026so they don\u2019t get to the same place.\u201d Camps can also help address the \u201cunique nuances\u201d of suicide grief, Hughes says. Loved ones often blame themselves, feeling as though they could have intervened if they\u2019d picked up on certain clues or been in the right place at the right time. They may also have experienced specific traumas, like finding their loved one\u2019s body or reading a suicide note they left behind. Many people who die by suicide have also previously dealt with substance use and mental-health disorders, which can impact the memories their loved ones carry. Research shows that people are at greater risk of suicidal behavior after someone they know dies by suicide. Children who lose a parent to suicide are also susceptible to developing suicidal behavior and psychiatric disorders, research suggests. Although far more adults than children die by suicide, rates of mental distress and suicidal thinking are on the rise among young people. As of 2021, more than 40% of high school students said they felt sad or hopeless; 30% of teen girls and 14% of teen boys had seriously considered suicide; and 13% of teen girls and 7% of teen boys had attempted suicide, federal data show. Given those alarming statistics, it\u2019s particularly important to support young people who may be at increased risk of self-harm or suicide, such as those who have experienced the death of a parent, sibling, or friend. Suicide bereavement isn\u2019t like other types of grief. It\u2019s a form of \u201cdisenfranchised grief,\u201d or grief that, due to social stigma, \u201cis not fully embraced and welcomed by society,\u201d says Sarah Behm, who works with the Eluna Network, a nonprofit that supports grieving children and families and runs Camp Erin, a nationwide network of bereavement camps. This stigma can make it difficult for people to openly grieve those they lost, often causing them to draw inward instead. Bereavement camps create safe spaces where people can freely discuss their losses without judgment, Behm says. That power is on full display at Comfort Zone Camp, where campers share their stories in age-group-specific \u201chealing circles\u201d to counter the hushed tones with which people usually talk about suicide, Hughes says. To start the circle, campers exchange pins to recognize what they appreciate and respect about one another. Then, campers volunteer to tell their stories. Passing around a stress ball to mark whose turn it is to share, some campers speak eloquently\u2014it\u2019s clear they\u2019ve told their stories before\u2014while others stammer as they describe difficult details aloud for the first time. Their peers listen quietly, then ask questions about their grief journey and the deceased. Who were they as a person? What was their favorite color? What\u2019s your favorite memory with them? Is there anything special you do on their death date? What brings you comfort when you\u2019re feeling sad? The answers aren\u2019t just healing for the speaker; sharing these lived experiences exposes everyone in the circle to new coping mechanisms. \u201cYou can talk without any fears\u201d in these healing circles, says 16-year-old Malachi Chass\u00e9, who attends Comfort Zone Camp to help cope with his father\u2019s death by suicide and his baby brother\u2019s accidental death. \u201cYou can share. Everyone\u2019s going to understand.\u201d Even outside healing circles, during activities that are ostensibly just for fun, there is an undercurrent of community and healing. As campers clamber through an obstacle course, Hughes asks how the experience is like grief. \u201cSome sections take longer than others,\u201d replies one camper. \u201cYou get down,\u201d adds another, \u201cand get back up.\u201d If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental-health crisis or contemplating suicide, call or text 988. In emergencies, call 911, or seek care from a local hospital or mental health provider.",

        "title": "Niger\u2019s junta rulers ask for help from Russia's Wagner mercenary group",
        "content": "Niger\u2019s new military junta has asked for help from the Russian Wagner mercenary group as the deadline nears for it to release the country\u2019s ousted president or face possible military intervention by the West African regional bloc, according to an analyst. The request came during a visit by one of the coup leaders, Gen. Salifou Mody, to neighboring Mali, where he made contact with someone from Wagner, Wassim Nasr, a journalist and senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, told The Associated Press. He said three Malian sources and a French diplomat confirmed the meeting first reported by France 24. \u201cThey need (Wagner) because they will become their guarantee to hold onto power,\u201d he said, adding that the group is considering the request. Niger\u2019s junta faces a Sunday deadline set by the regional bloc known as ECOWAS to release and reinstate the democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum, who has described himself as a hostage. Defense chiefs from ECOWAS members finalized an intervention plan on Friday and urged militaries to ready resources after a mediation team sent to Niger on Thursday wasn\u2019t allowed to enter the city or meet with junta leader Gen. Abdourahmane Tchiani. After his visit to Mali, run by a sympathetic junta, Mody warned against a military intervention, vowing that Niger would do what it takes not to become \u201ca new Libya,\u201d Niger\u2019s state television reported Friday. Niger has been seen as the West\u2019s last reliable counterterrorism partner in a region where coups have been common in recent years. Juntas have been rejecting former colonizer France and turning toward Russia. Wagner operates in a handful of African countries, including Mali, where human rights groups have accused its forces of abuses. One can\u2019t say there\u2019s any direct implication of Russia in Niger\u2019s coup, but \u201cclearly, there\u2019s an opportunistic attitude on the part of Russia, which tries to support destabilization efforts wherever it finds them,\u201d French foreign affairs ministry spokeswoman Anne-Claire Legendre told broadcaster BFM on Friday. Days after Niger\u2019s junta seized power, residents waved Russian flags in the streets. The spokeswoman described Wagner as a \u201crecipe for chaos.\u201d On Saturday, France\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Catherine Colonna, said the regional threat of force was credible and warned the putschists to take it seriously. \u201cCoups are no longer appropriate ... It\u2019s time to put an end to it,\u201d she said. The ministry said France supports \u201cwith firmness and determination\u201d the ECOWAS efforts to make sure the coup leaders fail, and it called for Bazoum and all members of his government to be freed. Niger\u2019s military leaders have been following the playbook of Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso, also run by a junta, but it\u2019s moving faster to consolidate power, Nasr said: \u201c(Tchiani) chose his path, so he\u2019s going full on it without wasting time because there\u2019s international mobilization.\u201d One question is how the international community will react if Wagner is brought in, he said. When Wagner came into Mali at the end of 2021, the French military was ousted shortly afterward after years of partnership. Wagner was later designated a terrorist organization by the United States, and international partners might have a stronger reaction now, Nasr said. And much more is at stake in Niger, where the U.S. and other partners have poured hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance in efforts to combat the region\u2019s growing jihadi threat. France has 1,500 soldiers in Niger, though coup leaders say they have severed security agreements with Paris, and the U.S. has 1,100 military personnel in the country. \u201cAt the moment, there\u2019s no real indication that the (junta) is going to soften its tone or make concessions ahead of the deadline,\u201d said Andrew Lebovich, research fellow with the Clingendael Institute and postdoctoral fellow with the Danish Institute for International Studies, saying an intervention \u201cpotentially serious consequences for Niger and for the region.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what an intervention would look like or when it would begin. Niger\u2019s junta has called on the population to watch for spies, and self-organized defense groups have mobilized at night to monitor cars and patrol the capital. Any intervention is fraught with risk, said a report by the Hudson Institute. \u201cIf the junta were to dig in its heels and rally the populace around the flag \u2014 possibly even arming civilian militias \u2014 the intervention could morph into a multifaceted counterinsurgency that ECOWAS would not be prepared to handle,\u201d it said. While some in Niger are bracing for a fight, others are trying to cope with travel and economic sanctions imposed by ECOWAS after the coup. The sanctions have closed land and air borders with ECOWAS countries and suspended commercial and financial transactions with member states. Residents said the price of goods is rising and there\u2019s limited access to cash. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the consequences of these sanctions, especially their impacts on the supply of essential food products, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, petroleum products and electricity,\u201d said Sita Adamou, president of Niger\u2019s Association to Defend Human Rights.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 North Korea has offered a very brief response to United Nations officials about an American soldier who dashed over the heavily-guarded border with South Korea last month and was taken into custody, the Pentagon said Tuesday. However, Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said that North Korea only acknowledged the U.N. Command\u2019s request for information about U.S. Army Private Travis King and stopped short of offering detailed information about him. \u201cI can confirm that the DPRK has responded to United Nations Command, but I don\u2019t have any substantial progress to read out,\u201d Ryder told a press conference, using the acronym of North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. When pressed, Ryder said that North Korea\u2019s message back to the U.N. Command was just \u201can acknowledgement\u201d of its inquiry. King sprinted into North Korea on July 18 while on a tour of the Demilitarized Zone on the border, landing the United States in a new diplomatic quandary with nuclear-armed North Korea. King, who joined the U.S. Army in January 2021, had served as a Cavalry Scout with the Korean Rotational Force, part of the decades-old U.S. security commitment to South Korea. But his posting was dogged by legal troubles. He faced two allegations of assault in South Korea, and eventually pleaded guilty to one instance of assault and destroying public property for damaging a police car during a profanity-laced tirade against Koreans, according to court documents. From May 24 to July 10 he served a sentence of hard labor at the Cheonan correctional facility in lieu of paying a fine, Yonhap news agency reported. After his release from the prison, which is designated for U.S. military members and other foreigners, King stayed at a U.S. base in South Korea for a week, Yonhap said. A Cheonan prison official confirmed King had served the hard labor sentence there, but declined to provide further information citing privacy concerns. U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said King had been due to face military disciplinary action on his return home to Fort Bliss, Texas. U.S. officials have expressed deep concern over King\u2019s fate in North Korea. The Army has noted the case of Otto Warmbier, a U.S. college student who was imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months and died shortly after he was returned to the United States in a coma in 2017.",

Daeges, whose father died by suicide when she was 12, says rising demand for these services underscores their dual purposes: to serve families who are already part of the \u201cunfortunate club\u201d of suicide bereavement, and to prevent others from joining it. \u201cCamp is both reactive and preventive at the same time,\u201d Daeges says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to support these families and the people left behind\u2026so they don\u2019t get to the same place.\u201d Camps can also help address the \u201cunique nuances\u201d of suicide grief, Hughes says. Loved ones often blame themselves, feeling as though they could have intervened if they\u2019d picked up on certain clues or been in the right place at the right time. They may also have experienced specific traumas, like finding their loved one\u2019s body or reading a suicide note they left behind. Many people who die by suicide have also previously dealt with substance use and mental-health disorders, which can impact the memories their loved ones carry. Research shows that people are at greater risk of suicidal behavior after someone they know dies by suicide. Children who lose a parent to suicide are also susceptible to developing suicidal behavior and psychiatric disorders, research suggests. Although far more adults than children die by suicide, rates of mental distress and suicidal thinking are on the rise among young people. As of 2021, more than 40% of high school students said they felt sad or hopeless; 30% of teen girls and 14% of teen boys had seriously considered suicide; and 13% of teen girls and 7% of teen boys had attempted suicide, federal data show. Given those alarming statistics, it\u2019s particularly important to support young people who may be at increased risk of self-harm or suicide, such as those who have experienced the death of a parent, sibling, or friend. Suicide bereavement isn\u2019t like other types of grief. It\u2019s a form of \u201cdisenfranchised grief,\u201d or grief that, due to social stigma, \u201cis not fully embraced and welcomed by society,\u201d says Sarah Behm, who works with the Eluna Network, a nonprofit that supports grieving children and families and runs Camp Erin, a nationwide network of bereavement camps. This stigma can make it difficult for people to openly grieve those they lost, often causing them to draw inward instead. Bereavement camps create safe spaces where people can freely discuss their losses without judgment, Behm says. That power is on full display at Comfort Zone Camp, where campers share their stories in age-group-specific \u201chealing circles\u201d to counter the hushed tones with which people usually talk about suicide, Hughes says. To start the circle, campers exchange pins to recognize what they appreciate and respect about one another. Then, campers volunteer to tell their stories. Passing around a stress ball to mark whose turn it is to share, some campers speak eloquently\u2014it\u2019s clear they\u2019ve told their stories before\u2014while others stammer as they describe difficult details aloud for the first time. Their peers listen quietly, then ask questions about their grief journey and the deceased. Who were they as a person? What was their favorite color? What\u2019s your favorite memory with them? Is there anything special you do on their death date? What brings you comfort when you\u2019re feeling sad? The answers aren\u2019t just healing for the speaker; sharing these lived experiences exposes everyone in the circle to new coping mechanisms. \u201cYou can talk without any fears\u201d in these healing circles, says 16-year-old Malachi Chass\u00e9, who attends Comfort Zone Camp to help cope with his father\u2019s death by suicide and his baby brother\u2019s accidental death. \u201cYou can share. Everyone\u2019s going to understand.\u201d Even outside healing circles, during activities that are ostensibly just for fun, there is an undercurrent of community and healing. As campers clamber through an obstacle course, Hughes asks how the experience is like grief. \u201cSome sections take longer than others,\u201d replies one camper. \u201cYou get down,\u201d adds another, \u201cand get back up.\u201d If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental-health crisis or contemplating suicide, call or text 988. In emergencies, call 911, or seek care from a local hospital or mental health provider.",

        "title": "Brick Lane: Chinese political slogans appear on London street art wall",
        "content": "London's Brick Lane, well known for its street art, has become a talking point after one of its walls was covered by slogans extolling Chinese Communist Party ideology. Online videos showed a group of people had spray painted the big red Chinese characters on a white background overnight at the weekend. The \"core socialist values\", composed of 12 two-character words, are some of the most common political slogans under President Xi Jinping's rule. Political propaganda in the form of red block characters on a white wall are a familiar sight in China. The Brick Lane slogans have sparked debate online over whether they count as street art and how freedom of expression and political propaganda interact. The wall has also become an arena for competing narratives - people swiftly added new graffiti criticising the Chinese government. Some added \"no\" in front, or posted other messages or images taking issue with the spray-painted words. One picture shows an \u00a3800 fine issued on Saturday, citing \"graffiti & flyposting\" as offences. Others were upset that the slogans covered up older works, including a tribute to a well-known street artist who died. The socialist slogans, first revealed by President Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao in 2012, include prosperity, democracy, civility, harmony, freedom, equality, justice, the rule of law, patriotism, dedication, integrity and friendship. Although the slogans have attracted negative comment, it's not clear if the people who painted them were being serious or ironic. Wang Hanzheng, one of the creators who also goes by the name Yi Que for his art works, claimed the piece \"didn't have much political meaning\". In an Instagram photo post, Mr Wang wrote in Chinese saying the group used the political elements as a coat \"to discuss different environments\". \"In the name of freedom and democracy, it illustrates the cultural centre of the West, this is London's freedom\u2026 Decolonize the false freedom of the West with the construction of socialism, let's see what happens,\" the post reads. \"Needless to say what's the situation on the other side,\" he added. Mr Wang told the BBC \"there is no question\" that the 24 characters are \"not only goals of China, but common goals for the world\". Pictures of the wall immediately sparked strong reactions among Chinese speakers on social media. Many inside China, mostly those who also defend the government, argued that what had been done in Brick Lane was freedom of expression and should be protected. Some said they were proud of this kind of \"cultural export\". But some nationalists also questioned whether it was a form of \"high-level black\", a term often used by state media and social media users to describe people who use not-so-apparent language to criticise and satirise the Communist Party regime. Outside China, the work has seen a flood of criticism. \"Obstructing freedom of speech is not a part of freedom of speech. The jargons you used cannot justify your brutal destruction of other people's art,\" a top-liked comment under Mr Wang's Instagram post reads. \"Do you dare to go to Beijing and write democracy and freedom? If you dare, the home country you love will dare to arrest you,\" another top comment wrote. Mr Wang admitted the reaction had been more intense than he expected. He told the BBC he had been doxed and his parents harassed. \"More and more people are using this subject for their own purposes and displaying maliciousness, this is not my intention,\" he added. Comments under his Instagram post of the work were no longer visible on Monday morning. \"This piece is not finished yet,\" wrote another creator Gino Huang on Instagram. \"Like any other graffiti, being covered and discussed will be this wall's final ending. We wish it\u2026 to turn into a part of this neighbourhood that can be seen every day when people pass it by, and to be included into a bigger narrative.\"",

        "content": "An Italian man has been crushed to death under thousands of wheels of a Parmesan-style cheese, authorities said. Giacomo Chiapparini, 74, was buried when a shelf broke in his warehouse in the Lombardy region on Sunday, firefighter Antonion Dusi told AFP. The collapse created a domino effect bringing down thousands of wheels, which weigh about 40kg (84lbs) each. It took 12 hours to find Mr Chiapparini's body, Mr Dusi said. Some of the wheels reportedly fell about 10m (33ft) and a local resident told Italian media the collapse sounded \"like thunder\". The economic damage caused has been estimated at \u20ac7m (\u00a36m). Speaking to Italian media, a neighbour described Mr Chiapparini as \"very supportive\u2026 and generous\". They also said he lost a child decades ago. The warehouse, located in Romano di Lombardia, about 50km (31 miles) east of Milan, contained a total of 25,000 wheels of Grana Padano, a hard cheese which resembles Parmesan and is popular in Italy.",

        "content": "The mother of Euphoria actor Angus Cloud, who died last week at the age of 25, has given an insight into his \"joyful\" final day, and said he \"did not intend to end his life\". Cloud, who played Fez in the hit HBO show, was found dead last Monday, days after attending his father's funeral. His mother Lisa wrote that although Cloud had been \"in deep grief\", his last day was \"a joyful one\". It was \"clear that he did not intend to check out of this world\", she added. In a message on Facebook, Lisa Cloud wrote: \"I want you all to know I appreciate your love for my family at this shattered time. I also want you to know that although my son was in deep grief about his father's untimely death from mesothelioma, his last day was a joyful one. \"He was reorganising his room and placing items around the house with intent to stay a while in the home he loved. He spoke of his intent to help provide for his sisters at college, and also help his mom emotionally and financially. He did not intend to end his life. \"When we hugged goodnight we said how much we loved each other and he said he would see me in the morning. I don't know if or what he may have put in his body after that. I only know that he put his head on the desk where he was working on art projects, fell asleep and didn't wake up.\" Mrs Cloud told emergency services her son had suffered a possible overdose, according to a recording of the 911 dispatch call obtained by US media. She wrote: \"We may find out that he overdosed accidentally and tragically, but it's abundantly clear that he did not intend to check out of this world. \"His struggles were real. He gave and received so much love and support to and from his tribe. His work in Euphoria became a lightning rod for his generation and opened up a conversation about compassion, loyalty, acceptance and love.\" She added: \"Social media posts have suggested his death was intentional. I want you to know that is not the case. To honour his memory, please make random acts of kindness part of your daily life. Bless your hearts.\" His cause of death has not yet been confirmed. Last week, a family statement announcing his death said Cloud had \"intensely struggled\" with the loss of his father. It added: \"Angus was open about his battle with mental health and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence. \"We hope the world remembers him for his humour, laughter and love for everyone.\" His death was met with an outpouring of tributes from fans and co-stars including Zendaya and Sydney Sweeney. Rappers Drake - an executive producer on Euphoria - and Kid Cudi also paid homage.",

        "title": "All scouts leaving South Korea camp as storm looms",
        "content": "Thousands of scouts at an international event in South Korea are being evacuated from a campsite due to an incoming tropical storm. Several countries including the UK had already left, blaming high temperatures and poor sanitary conditions at the camp. UK Scouts chief executive Matt Hyde said he felt let down by organisers and UK activities had been set back years. The site had become a health risk, he told the BBC. Attended by more than 40,000 young people from 155 countries, the World Scout Jamboree has been plagued by problems from the very start. Hundreds had fallen ill amid 35C (95F) heat, with scouts from the UK among those affected by heat exhaustion. The British group of 4,500 people, the largest in attendance, arrived at the campsite in Saemangeum near the town of Buan last week. They were moved to hotels in the capital Seoul over the weekend, where they will remain until the jamboree finishes on 12 August. Mr Hyde said the relocation will cost the UK Scout Association well over \u00a31m from its reserves. \"We had commitments to those reserves that will of course mean that we can't now do things that we wanted to do over the next three to five years,\" he said. The US and Singapore have also already pulled their teams from the campsite. World Scout Jamboree organisers said on Monday that the South Korean government told them it was no longer safe to hold the event. The government said it had listened to the concerns of the World Organisation for Scout Movements and national delegations, who had been requesting they close the site for days. From Tuesday at 10:00 local time (01:00GMT), some 36,000 people still in Saemangeum will be taken by bus to safer areas, South Korea's vice minister for disaster and safety management, Kim Sung-ho, has said. The event \"is still continuing,\" but \"the location is only changing because of the natural disaster,\" he added. Officials are seeking alternative venues and accommodation in and around Seoul. Severe Tropical Storm Khanun, which has already forced evacuations and cut off power to thousands in Japan, is forecast to reach South Korea's southern Jeolla province on Thursday. Originally classified as a typhoon, the weather system has weakened but is still bringing high winds and torrential rain to the region. Heatwaves have become more frequent, more intense, and last longer because of human-induced climate change. Increased sea surface temperatures also mean storms are likely to be more intense and bring more extreme rainfall. Coaches of British teenagers started arriving back in Seoul - around 120 miles (197km) from the campsite - on Saturday. Mr Hyde said the UK contingent was focused on running an \"engaging programme\" from their young people from the capital. He said the UK Scouts feel let down by the organisers after repeated concerns were raised about conditions at the site. While there were some improvements it was \"too little too late\". Conditions breached four red lines around a lack of shade, lack of food for those with dietary needs, poor sanitation and insufficient medical services, he added. \"We were promised things were going to be put in place and they weren't,\" he said. \"If you can imagine [toilets] that are being used by thousands and thousands of people that are not being cleared with the regularity you would expect, you can imagine the sort of things that people were seeing.\" Each British scout had spent around \u00a33,500 on the trip, with many relying on fundraising, he said. Planning of the event may have been affected by the Covid pandemic, Mr Hyde said, adding it was \"critical\" an independent review was carried out. One parent told the BBC concerns about the event were raised two weeks ago when torrential rain fell and flooded Saemangeum, a reclaimed tidal flat. Vincent Blood, whose daughter fell ill at the event, said: \"How on earth are you going to go from a flooded site to something that's adequate and going to provide this superb experience the kids have been looking forward to? \"Our fears have now been justified.\" The BBC has seen emails sent to the parents of young people on the trip by UK Scouts. One email sent on 31 July before the scouts arrived at the site said an inspection revealed it was not ready \"as we would have expected\". Parents were told facilities were \"improving continuously\" on 2 August, two days before a decision to leave was taken citing numerous problems on the site. The BBC has been told that some scouts are now sharing five to a room, while up to 250 spent a night in the ballroom of one Seoul hotel due to a lack of available accommodation. All now have hotel rooms. The head of the country's ruling People's Power Party, Kim Gi-hyeon, issued a public apology on Monday and proposed an investigation into whether taxpayers' money had been well spent on preparations. The jamboree, described as the world's largest youth camp, gathers scouts from around the world every four years, each time in a different country.

        "title": "New Technique Restores Motion and Feeling to Paralyzed Man",
        "content": "Acluster of researchers surround 45-year-old Keith Thomas, their eyes fixed on his right hand. \u201cOpen, open, open,\u201d they urge, cheering when his fingers flutter out to mirror an image on a computer screen and again when they begin to curl back inward. Thomas, who was paralyzed from the chest down after a diving accident in July 2020, is able to move his hand again thanks to a cutting-edge clinical trial led by researchers from Northwell Health\u2019s Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in New York. Chad Bouton, a bioengineer at the Feinstein Institutes who is leading the trial, says he believes Thomas is the first human in the world to receive a double neural bypass, a technology that links his brain, spinal cord, and body in hopes of restoring both his ability to move and his sense of touch\u2014even outside the laboratory. So far, the therapy seems to be working. Thomas is now able to lift his arms and can feel sensations on his skin, including the touch of his sister\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s indescribable,\u201d Thomas says, \u201cto be able to feel something.\u201d When Thomas began working with Bouton\u2019s lab in 2021, he couldn\u2019t lift his arms off his wheelchair frame. For about a year, to help Bouton and his team get a sense of his baseline post-accident function, Thomas\u2019 primary task was to watch hands moving on a computer screen and try to copy their motions. Much to his frustration, his body couldn't match his mind's commands. That changed after a 15-hour surgery in March 2023, during which neurosurgeon Dr. Ashesh Mehta placed five tiny, fragile electrode arrays in the hyper-specific regions of Thomas\u2019 brain that control motion and feeling in his right hand and fingers. To confirm he\u2019d found the right spots, Mehta awakened Thomas during surgery and stimulated those areas of the brain. Immediately, he says, Thomas could feel some of his fingers for the first time in almost three years. \u201cIt was a very good feeling,\u201d Mehta says. Now, when Thomas thinks about moving\u2014imagining himself squeezing a bottle, for example\u2014the arrays transmit the electrical signals in his brain to an amplifier on his skull, which via an HDMI cable passes the signals on to a gaming computer sitting a few feet away. The computer decodes those messages and sends a signal to electrodes placed on Thomas\u2019 skin, which stimulate the muscles he needs to perform the motion he\u2019s envisioning. The whole thing happens almost in real time, though it takes effort on Thomas\u2019 part to imagine and attempt the movement. This process feels harder on some days than others, Thomas says, and it\u2019s not always clear why. But after all those months of staring at hands, Thomas can finally use his. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing,\u201d he says. Along with motion, Thomas is also regaining a sense of feeling. When he touches an object or person, sensors on his skin send a signal to the computer, which then communicates with the arrays in his brain. He can now feel a hand in his, or a feather stroking the sensors on his fingertips. Touch doesn\u2019t feel exactly how it did before the accident\u2014Thomas describes it as a burst of energy\u2014but it\u2019s progress. \u201cTouching someone\u2019s hand and feeling that is such an important part of life,\u201d Bouton says. An accurate sense of touch is also essential for carrying out functional tasks, like buttoning a shirt or holding a styrofoam coffee cup without crushing it. Thomas\u2019 case shows how far paralysis research has advanced in the last few decades. About 20 years ago, researchers began demonstrating that brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)\u2014like the one now used by Thomas\u2014could help people with paralysis perform tasks using their thoughts. About a decade later, building upon research that showed humans with paralysis could use their thoughts to control robotic limbs, Bouton and his team used a neural bypass to restore movement, but not sensation, to the arm of a man who had been paralyzed in an accident. In the years since, research teams have used spinal-cord stimulation to restore mobility to people recovering from accidents or strokes. And earlier this year, a scientific team reported that they\u2019d helped a man with paralysis begin to walk naturally again by creating a bridge between his brain and spinal cord. The new trial with Thomas (results from which have not yet been published in a scientific journal) pushes the field forward by \u201ccombining all the elements\u2014brain, body, and spine\u2014and movement and the sense of touch,\u201d Bouton says. Unlike in his previous neural-bypass work, Bouton adds, Thomas is slowly but surely relearning to move and feel even when he\u2019s not attached to the computer system in the laboratory. That\u2019s thanks to the extra connection between his brain and spinal cord, in addition to the bridge between his brain and body. Each time Thomas performs a motion when he is attached to the computer, the system stimulates the portion of his spinal cord that sits just below his injury\u2014essentially, reestablishing contact between his brain and spinal cord and helping his body train to again move and feel on its own. \u201cThat electrical stimulation, we believe, is awakening circuits that have been damaged and dormant for three years,\u201d Bouton says. Only a few months post-operation, Thomas is able to move his arms when he\u2019s not connected to the computer and can describe where on his arm he\u2019s being touched, even with his eyes closed. The team has also observed small natural movements in his fingers, another good sign. Thomas\u2019 spirits are up, he says, now that he can see his accomplishments during his twice-weekly visits to the Feinstein Institutes, which he spends cracking jokes and listening to his favorite musician, Harry Styles. Thomas is motivated to keep going both by his own gains and by the promise of pioneering a technology that could someday help others, he says. Widespread adoption of neural bypass technology is likely a ways off; it\u2019s taken millions of dollars in research funding and a team of dozens to get Thomas to this point. (The clinical trial that Bouton is running aims to test the technology in up to three people, but Thomas is the first to be implanted.) In hopes of benefitting a larger group of people, Bouton is also working on a separate, non-invasive system meant to stimulate movement through electrodes placed on the skin\u2014no surgery required. Bouton says such a product could be a good fit for people with less-extensive paralysis, such as those who have suffered a stroke, or who don\u2019t want to undergo brain surgery. If the system works for those populations, Bouton says, \u201cnow you\u2019ve opened up the door to millions and millions of folks around the world.\u201d",

        "title": "How to Strengthen Your Friendships",
        "content": "It might sound obvious, in the midst of a loneliness crisis, that having friends matters. But many of us \u201cunderestimate the very real impact our friendships can have on our life,\u201d says Marisa Franco, a psychologist and author of Platonic: How The Science of Attachment Can Help You Make\u2014and Keep\u2014Friends. \u201cConnection is the most important factor predicting our health, both physical and mental.\u201d A growing body of research supports that point: Healthy, stable friendships can protect against depression and anxiety, increase life satisfaction, extend longevity, and improve health metrics like blood pressure and body mass index. Friendships between men\u2014or bromances\u2014can provide an effective buffer against stress, and can even be more emotionally satisfying than romantic relationships.  Those who don\u2019t have strong social connections, meanwhile, have an elevated risk of heart disease and stroke, Type 2 diabetes, depression, anxiety, addiction, and dementia. Some research suggests that loneliness is twice as harmful to physical and mental health as obesity. It\u2019s concerning, then, that over the past few years, adult friendships have been on the decline, with men suffering the most: In one survey, 15% of men said they had no close friends at all, a fivefold increase since 1990. While many people assume it\u2019s the number of friends that count, research indicates that quality is more important\u2014and having even a small selection of close friends is a stronger predictor of happiness than having lots of casual connections. Plus, those who think friendships happen organically are lonelier five years later than those who understand that platonic bonds take work. Yet often people who feel disconnected focus on making new friends instead of nurturing existing connections. \u201cThere can be this feeling of, \u2018I need to look elsewhere. I need to start a whole new circle of friends,\u2019\u201d says Miriam Kirmayer, a clinical psychologist who studies the science of friendship. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s truth to that, but for many people, it\u2019s helpful to think about the friendships we already have in our lives. Even if they feel a little stale, there are ways we can revive them.\u201d We asked experts to share their favorite ways to strengthen friendships and breathe new life into old bonds. Making time for the people we care about and having shared experiences plays an essential role in deepening friendships. Research suggests that it takes about 50 hours of time together to transform from acquaintances to casual friends, 90 hours to become regular friends, and more than 200 hours to solidify a best friendship. Laura Tremaine figured out a solution after constantly \u201cdropping the ball\u201d on putting in time and effort with her friends. She would forget to wish them a happy birthday or go three months without returning a call. So she started adding a section for connection at the bottom of her to-do list, underneath her work tasks and family-oriented chores. \u201cI just write down a few things, like \u2018check if Bri is feeling better,\u2019\u201d says Tremaine, author of books including The Life Council: 10 Friends Every Woman Needs. \u201cAnd when I started to be more consistent, my friends noticed.\u201d One way to grow any relationship is to foster positivity, which has to do with the way we leave each other feeling, says Shasta Nelson, the author of books including Friendships Don\u2019t Just Happen. \u201cIt\u2019s not always about saying positive things,\u201d she clarifies. \u201cIt\u2019s about leaving the other person feeling loved, supported, and accepted, and you walking away feeling loved, supported, and accepted.\u201d Often, this means using words of affirmation, giving our friends compliments, and making them laugh. If you\u2019re feeling tired or depressed, or are in a bad mood, don\u2019t feel pressure to entertain your friends or force jokes. Be open about how you\u2019re feeling, and give them permission to feel differently while expressing curiosity, Nelson suggests. For example, you might acknowledge that you\u2019ve been glum lately, and then note that you saw Instagram pictures of your friend hiking. Ask them to tell you all about it. Showing interest and asking questions helps promote positivity, even when that runs counter to your mood. \u201cThe goal is for our friends to walk away from us feeling better about themselves and their lives for having been in our presence,\u201d she says. Another key to cultivating stronger friendships is allowing yourself to be vulnerable: opening up and showing your friends your true self, even if you\u2019re worried they won\u2019t like it. Research suggests that can be particularly difficult for men, who often avoid  expressing intimate feelings because they fear social rejection. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it,\u201d Tremaine says. \u201cThere\u2019s no loophole. You\u2019re going to have to be at least a little vulnerable and share a little about who you are to connect with other humans.\u201d However, she qualifies, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to immediately reveal all your most personal traumas and secrets. Tremaine suggests starting by sharing small opinions: Raise your hand in whatever room you\u2019re in, whether it\u2019s volunteering what you thought about your book club\u2019s latest choice or how you would grill the steaks. \u201cThe more yourself you are, the more attractive you are to others as friends,\u201d she says. Challenge yourself to dive even deeper by telling your friends what you\u2019re currently struggling with and what scares you, Franco advises. If it feels uncomfortable, remember that it\u2019s better for you\u2014and the other person\u2014than staying silent. \u201cWhen we\u2019re vulnerable, we feel like we\u2019re burdening people,\u201d she says. \u201cBut being vulnerable conveys that we like them and trust them. And fundamentally, that brings people closer together.\u201d It might be time to inject a shot of new energy into your most familiar friendships. That goes for both conversations and activities: We tend to talk about the same topics over and over, and meet at the same places at the same times. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, Kirmayer notes, but novelty can open the door to deeper bonds. \u201cCarve out moments of conversation where you can go off script,\u201d she says. And brainstorm new adventures you can embark on together, whether that\u2019s traveling to a bucket-list destination or working up the nerve to join a pickleball team together. When\u2019s the last time you told your friends how much you appreciate them? There\u2019s good reason to do so the next time you talk: Research suggests that gratitude plays an important role in helping friendships grow. Make it a point to show you\u2019re thankful for who they are as a person\u2014their core traits and values\u2014and the big and little things they do. \u201cNotice the moment when a friend says something really supportive, or when they initiate plans,\u201d Kirmayer advises. You might phrase it like this: \u201cThank you so much for being the one to put together plans for this weekend. It really meant a lot.\u201d If you\u2019re feeling particularly inspired, you could even write what some experts call a \u201cliving eulogy,\u201d or a letter that outlines everything you admire and appreciate about your friend. Every friendship will inevitably arrive at what Franco describes as diagnostic moments: The highs and lows in life that \u201cdisproportionately affect\u201d how we label our relationships. Was your friend there when you got a promotion, were diagnosed with something scary, went through a divorce, or met someone new? The answer plays a large role in determining how much we\u2019ll value that friendship.  If you\u2019re feeling disconnected from a friend, bring it up in conversation. Tell them how much you care about them and let them know you\u2019d like to find ways to stay connected or deepen your connection\u2014and ask if they have any ideas that could help make that happen, Kirmayer suggests. The goal is to have a collaborative, productive conversation, while making it clear how much you value the friendship. If you\u2019re upset about something specific that happened, address it directly instead of simply withdrawing, Franco advises. \u201cWhen you don't bring things up, it's like holding someone guilty before giving them a trial,\u201d she says. \u201cHealthy conflict can just look like, \u2018Hey, I was hurt when this happened, and I hoped we could talk it out.\u2019\u201d Some friends even go to therapy together, just like romantic partners might, Franco adds. That can be particularly helpful if you have a tendency to let little issues accumulate without addressing them. \u201cFriendship is very important, and intimacy is intimacy,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we need that tune-up for one type of relationship, we\u2019re going to need it for another.\u201d",

        "title": "COVID-19 Cases Are Rising. Should You Get A Booster Shot?",
        "content": "With summer travel in full swing, and masks a distant memory, it\u2019s not entirely surprising that COVID-19 cases are creeping upward again. Along with the increase, some states in the U.S. are also recording upticks in COVID-19 hospitalizations, especially among older people. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), weekly hospitalizations have been rising slightly since the middle of June, from around 6,300 to more than 8,000 for the week ending July 22. The agency no longer reports on national case numbers since the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency in May, meaning state health departments were no longer required to report this data to the CDC. The trend reflects the waning immunity that most of the population has against SARS-CoV-2, since the last widespread recommendation for a booster shot was in April, when the CDC advised that most people receive a booster targeting the viral variants Omicron BA.4/5. These variants, however, have since been replaced by new ones, of the XBB variety, which means the protection the current booster provides is less than ideal. Earlier this year, US health officials decided to update the booster in the fall, but have yet to announce which variant to target, although it\u2019s likely the new shot will focus on some version of the currently circulating XBB virus variant. Until that happens, does it make sense to get another booster shot to better protect against getting infected? The answer to that really depends on your individual situation, says Dr. David Wohl, professor of medicine at the Institute of Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For people who are older, and may be traveling or otherwise find themselves in close quarters with other people, getting a booster now may make sense, especially if their last shot was more than three months ago. \u201cIf people are doing square dancing, playing bingo or going on cruises, and it\u2019s been a long time since they were last vaccinated, they should probably top up sooner rather than later,\u201d says Wohl. The same goes for people with weakened immune systems, whom the CDC also recommends get boosted more regularly to keep their immunity as strong as possible. Even though the current booster does not specifically target the XBB viral variants that are currently circulating, it \u201cis not chopped liver,\u201d says Wohl. \u201cIt works because there are enough conserved parts of the variants that the existing vaccines continue to work.\u201d They have been particularly effective in protecting people from getting seriously sick with COVID-19, which is why hospitalization, even though they are increasing slightly in some parts of the country, remain relatively low. But for most otherwise healthy people who take reasonable precautions against getting infected, such as wearing masks in public settings and in poorly ventilated environments, waiting a few weeks for the updated booster may make sense. \u201cI\u2019m 59, I was vaccinated with the bivalent booster in September, and I\u2019m pretty careful where I breathe without a mask,\u201d says Wohl. \u201cI will continue to do that and wait [to get boosted] because I know the consequences of my getting infected are probably pretty minimal.\u201d Read More: COVID-19 Can Affect the Brain Even Long After an Infection Other experts believe it couldn\u2019t hurt for even otherwise healthy people to get another booster now. \u201cI believe that it\u2019s important for those who feel they might be at risk for more severe disease, or for healthy people who feel they want maximum protection, to get a booster,\u201d says Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, an infectious disease specialist at Ochsner Health in New Orleans. Kemmerly has written several prescriptions for the antiviral treatment Paxlovid for COVID-19 patients this week, and has seen more people hospitalized for the disease as well in recent weeks. \u201cI don\u2019t think that waiting for the updated booster to come around is necessarily prudent while we are seeing increased cases.\u201d Kemmerly points out that those who might want more protection aren\u2019t necessarily those with weakened immune systems, but people who might be on multiple medications or being treated with slightly immunosuppressive drugs like prednisone for a skin condition who might be at higher risk of both getting infected with COVID-19 and becoming seriously ill when they do. She acknowledges that there isn\u2019t strong enough data showing that the current booster that targets Omicron BA.4/5 can protect against infection with the newer variants, but scientific precedent, such as with the flu shot, suggests that it can provide some protection, even if it\u2019s not the maximum protection. In addition, vaccines aren\u2019t the only source of immunity. At this point in the pandemic, more people have also been infected with the virus, whether they have been vaccinated or not. While it\u2019s not clear whether getting vaccinated or infected provides stronger protection, it\u2019s likely the vaccine does protect people from getting seriously ill. Wohl points out that while we hear about cases of vaccinated people getting infected, we don\u2019t hear about how often vaccinated people who are exposed to the virus don\u2019t get infected. \u201cI do believe there is some immunity [from the vaccine] against infection, or that people get transiently infected and knock out the virus before they develop symptoms,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to capture that in data.\u201d The protection provided by the existing vaccine, even if it\u2019s not optimal, is therefore still important, and could be contributing to the smaller peaks in cases than we\u2019ve seen in the past. \u201cHopefully the surges will be more like surge-lets, because of immunity we have from vaccines and infections,\u201d says Wohl. That is, at least until a new variant shows up that may escape all of this built up immunity. Then it\u2019s back to the starting blocks for vaccines and creating a new immunological wall of defense against that variant.",

        "title": "'He\u2019s Going to Testify\u2019: Pence Has Key Role in Trump\u2019s Case",
        "content": "Out of all the Republican presidential candidates, none may pose a greater threat to Donald Trump\u2019s future than Mike Pence. That\u2019s not because the former Vice President is mounting much of a challenge for the GOP nomination. He\u2019s trailing Trump by nearly 50 points in the polls. It\u2019s because Pence may be the most important witness in Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s prosecution against Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election. In a four-count, 45-page indictment unsealed on Tuesday, federal prosecutors alleged that Trump knowingly spread lies of a stolen election and engaged in an illicit, multi-faceted effort to remain in power. A substantial portion of Smith\u2019s case hinges on the former President\u2019s pressure campaign against Pence leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of rioters disrupted the Congressional certification of the Electoral College.  In one of their phone calls in the days before the attack, Trump allegedly told Pence that he was \u201ctoo honest\u201d after his second-in-command refused to unilaterally reject the election results. In another, Pence called Trump on Christmas Day to wish him a happy holiday, but the President quickly turned the conversation to Jan. 6, pressing his Veep to nullify Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. Prosecutors drew both scenes\u2014which until now have not been part of the public record\u2014from contemporaneous notes that Pence provided to the Special Counsel.  The revelations reflect the unprecedented scenario revolving around Pence, who is not only running against his old boss for the 2024 GOP nomination, but serving as a central player in the prosecution against the President under whom he served.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear he\u2019s going to testify,\u201d Harry Litman, a former U.S. Attorney, tells TIME. \u201cPence is the most integral fact witness. He was the sitting Vice President of the United States. It's an extremely dramatic moment\u2014I'd say even a historic one\u2014for the former Vice President to take the stand. That will be a seismic moment in what\u2019s already the most important prosecution in U.S. history.\u201d After a lengthy investigation, the Special Counsel brought four charges against Trump, including conspiracy to defraud the government, conspiracy against the right to vote, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and obstruction of an official proceeding.  Shortly after the Jan. 6 indictment was announced on Tuesday, Pence differentiated himself from many other prominent Republicans, who were quick to characterize Trump\u2019s latest legal setback as part of a \u201cdeep-state\u201d conspiracy to prevent him from reclaiming the White House. \u201cToday's indictment serves as an important reminder: anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be President of the United States,\u201d Pence said in a statement.  \u201cOn Jan. 6, former President Trump demanded that I choose between him and the Constitution. I chose the Constitution and I always will.\u201d For months, Pence has said that Trump will be held accountable in the eyes of history for his role on Jan. 6. But he has not explicitly said whether he would testify against the former President who egged on his supporters who stormed the Capitol that day chanting \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201d The two have not spoken since Trump left office. Despite their falling out, Trump has told associates in recent weeks to hold their fire against Pence, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of left Mike Pence alone,\u201d a source close to Trump tells TIME. \u201cEven on the documents stuff, he was telling people to leave Mike Pence alone,\u201d referring to the former Vice President having discovered classified materials in his Indiana home in January, which he turned over to the FBI.  \u201cI feel badly for Mike Pence, who is attracting no crowds, enthusiasm, or loyalty from people who, as a member of the Trump Administration, should be loving him,\u201d Trump posted Wednesday on his social media platform Truth Social, adding \u201cThe V.P. had power that Mike didn\u2019t understand.\u201d Trump is more offended by Ron DeSantis, the source says, who is running against him after Trump\u2019s endorsement helped to secure his GOP nomination for Florida Governor five years ago. \u201cWith Pence, it\u2019s more of a principles thing. Trump respects that he has some values to an extent. But he sees DeSantis as a power-grabbing, brazen, disloyal rat. I think that's the difference.\u201d Trump\u2019s fiercest allies have cast Smith\u2019s prosecution as the manifestation of a political witch hunt. Pence\u2019s role in the indictment, they say, is part of a ploy to divide the GOP. \u201cThe whole Mike Pence strategy is to drive a wedge between Republicans,\u201d Mike Davis, a Trump confidante who founded the conservative Article III Project, tells TIME. \u201cIt\u2019s not illegal for President Trump to put pressure on his Vice President to not certify the election. Some people might think it\u2019s boorish, but that doesn\u2019t make it a felony.\u201d Davis, who speaks to Trump regularly, also said that he doesn\u2019t hold an ongoing personal animus against Pence. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any ill will between Trump and Pence. He sees Mike Pence as a boy scout, and Trump\u2019s used to dealing with New York construction crews.\u201d The indictment is the latest in a long string of Trump\u2019s legal woes. He\u2019s also facing charges from a separate special counsel investigation by Smith alleging he hoarded national-security secrets and obstructed the government\u2019s efforts to retrieve them. In New York, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg indicted Trump in April over allegations that he falsified business records to conceal hush-money payments to a porn star. On Thursday, Trump is set to appear before U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan, a 2014 Obama appointee, in Washington, D.C. Smith\u2019s prosecutors are expected to seek a speedy trial. That\u2019s why some legal experts suspect the indictment listed six unnamed co-conspirators but did not indict any of them\u2014hoping a lean indictment focused on Trump would have a better chance of making it to trial before the November 2024 election. Some also suspect that Smith will try to flip some of those alleged co-conspirators in the weeks to come.  Yet legal experts believe that Pence\u2019s testimony would carry more weight than most others. \u201cThere are witnesses in Mr. Trump's other cases that have real credibility issues,\u201d says Anna Cominsky, a professor at New York Law School. \u201cThere are potential witnesses in this case that have credibility issues. Former Vice President Pence is certainly someone who comes across with a lot of credibility. If Pence were to testify, it would be much harder for the defense attorneys to attack his credibility.\u201d It\u2019s the reason Pence poses more of a danger to Trump in a courtroom than on the campaign trail. \u201cThe biggest threat is Trump to himself,\u201d Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor and Democratic U.S. Senator, tells TIME. \u201cIt is and always has been, but obviously, he has put Mike Pence in a position where he will be a central character in any prosecution going forward. I don't think Mike Pence chose to be in that position. But he will take it and he will deal with it.\u201d",

        "title": "Why the COVID-19 Pandemic Triggered Early Puberty",
        "content": "Italy noticed it first. It was the first country to lock down during the COVID-19 pandemic, and later in 2020, researchers at Florence\u2019s Anna Meyer Children\u2019s University Hospital were the first to point out a puzzling trend: More young girls than ever had been showing up to the hospital with clear signs of early-onset puberty.  The cases weren\u2019t unique, but their frequency was. Since early-onset\u2014or \u201cprecocious\u201d\u2014puberty first gained widespread clinical attention in the 1990s, it\u2019s become steadily more common worldwide. Defined as the appearance of secondary sex characteristics such as breasts, pubic hair, and vocal changes or other signs of biological maturity in girls 8 or younger and boys 9 or younger, precocious puberty has been difficult for researchers to attribute to a single cause or mechanism. But a mysterious, pandemic-generated spike in cases\u2014in Italy and beyond\u2014has provided experts with a new opportunity to revisit their dominant theories in hopes of an answer. Case studies have now rolled in from clinics around the world, many of whom saw at least a two- or three-fold increase in precocious puberty diagnoses after March 2020. In China\u2019s Henan Province, for example, doctors at 22 facilities saw five times more cases in 2020 than they did in 2018.\n\nMore recently, documentation has turned to inquiry.  There\u2019s no conclusive answer about what causes premature development, though research shows that the constellation of factors at play includes stress and trauma, as well as lifestyle habits like poor diets and lack of exercise that are tied to weight gain in children. In many countries, pandemic measures saddled children with this exact package of pressures. It\u2019s no wonder that precocious puberty rates soared. Precocious puberty is most often diagnosed in girls, simply because \u201cpuberty in girls is more visible,\u201d says Sena Orsdemir, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Loma Linda University Children's Hospital, who authored a 2019 paper reviewing treatment options for precocious puberty. Growing breasts, for many girls, is a public experience, and in spaces like the American school system, developing early can mean a minefield of unwanted attention. Then there\u2019s the distress of watching their bodies evolve, which can be jarring even for those old enough to have received proper context and education. \u201cFirst and second graders, they\u2019re not mature enough to handle this type of body change,\u201d says Orsdemir. \u201cThat is a big stress for a young girl.\u201d Perhaps as a result, early puberty has been linked to mood disorders and some behavioral issues. Aside from the psychological repercussions, precocious puberty can also put children at risk years later for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain reproductive cancers. When signs show up early, often around age 6 or before, it can be treated with hormonal puberty blockers. Though some cases are easily traceable to genetic or anomalous causes,like an ovarian tumor setting off hormone production, precocious puberty has most often been linked to obesity. Decades of research have found that childhood body weight (often classified by body mass indexBodyMI) is a strong predictor of menarche, or the onset of menstruation, in particular. The mechanism is often assumed to be hormones such as leptin, which grows more concentrated during puberty but is also produced by fatty tissue. A study published in 2012 found that BMI data was able to account for 40% of the variation in when girls began their periods. Early menarche is also associated with lower birth weight, as well as rapid childhood weight gain, supporting the theory that the physiology of body composition could govern the mechanism that kicks off puberty. Childhood obesity is a growing problem worldwide, which could help explain why precocious puberty has also remained on the rise internationally.

But although they might play a role, many studies have tried and failed to identify any meaningful connection between specific substances and chemical classes and the early arrival of puberty. Other exposures, too, have been suggested to make an impact\u2014inconclusive research has explored a potential link between electromagnetic fields emitted by everyday devices and altered endocrine function. \u201cMy families bring different herbal products, they bring different vitamins,\u201d says Orsdemir. \u201cThey ask about different foods, different diets, and I tell them I don't have an answer because I don't have any evidence.\u201d Instead, she reinforces the importance of proper nutrition for healthy child development. Still, none of this sufficiently explains the explosion in precocious puberty during COVID-19, and the newest wave of research has instead zeroed in on stress as a key driver. Stress was linked to early puberty before the pandemic, though there\u2019s little evidence it\u2019s a clear cause. Childhood sexual abuse is associated with the appearance of secondary sex characteristics as much as a year earlier in girls, as are a number of other environmental factors that are easily tied to stress, such as parental absence and race-related weathering.  In 2020, researchers saw cases skyrocket while locked down kids faced the stresses of a lifetime, leading to renewed interest in uncovering the specific mechanisms of action behind these stress factors. \u201cWe know from recent data that the psychosocial burden before and after the pandemic is increasing dramatically,\u201d says Mohamad Maghnie, head of the pediatric clinic at the Giannina Gaslini Institute at the University of Genoa in Italy. When he saw the spike of precocious puberty in young girls at his clinic in 2020, he says, \u201cmy first thought was focused on lifestyle changes related to social isolation.\u201d In his latest study, published in the Journal of the Endocrine Society on August 3, Maghnie and his team identify lifestyle changes as contributing factors that many children faced during the pandemic, such as poor eating habits, decreased movement, impaired sleep, and excess screen time. Their study, which looks at data from more than 100 girls suspected to be in precocious puberty from January 2016 to June 2021, found that of the patients seen during the first 15 months of the pandemic, nearly 90% had stopped all physical activity.  Because many of these lifestyle changes are also linked to obesity in children, it\u2019s difficult to tell whether they contribute to the onset of puberty by altering BMI, stress levels, or both, but the pandemic provided an ideal experimental setup for endocrinologists to examine it. The key, Maghnie believes, will be to compare data \u201cfrom different countries who underwent different models of \u2018lockdown\u2019 and protections,\u201d which could help highlight the effects of certain stressors or lifestyle changes more than others. It\u2019s also possible, Maghnie and his co-authors write, that the pandemic simply meant that parents spotted signs of precocious puberty earlier due to being confined with their children.  Researchers aren\u2019t sure yet whether or not the increased rate of precocious puberty has continued, now years after lockdown, but anecdotal evidence from clinics suggests it has. Orsdemir believes that this is because people, including children, have not returned to their pre-pandemic habits. \u201cThis is becoming normal now,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the long term, the biggest impact will be psychosocial for sure.\u201d",

        "title": "Trucking giant Yellow declares bankruptcy after years of financial struggles",
        "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Trucking company Yellow Corp. has declared bankruptcy after years of financial struggles and growing debt, marking a significant shift for the U.S. transportation industry and shippers nationwide. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which was filed Sunday, comes just three years after Yellow received $700 million in pandemic-era loans from the federal government. But the company was in financial trouble long before that \u2014 with industry analysts pointing to poor management and strategic decisions dating back decades. Former Yellow customers and shippers will face higher prices as they take their business to competitors, including FedEx or ABF Freight, experts say \u2014 noting Yellow historically offered the cheapest price points in the industry. \u201cIt is with profound disappointment that Yellow announces that it is closing after nearly 100 years in business,\u201d CEO Darren Hawkins said in a news release late Sunday. \u201cFor generations, Yellow provided hundreds of thousands of Americans with solid, good-paying jobs and fulfilling careers.\u201d Yellow, formerly known as YRC Worldwide Inc., is one of the nation\u2019s largest less-than-truckload carriers. The Nashville, Tennessee-based company had 30,000 employees across the country. The Teamsters, which represented Yellow\u2019s 22,000 unionized workers, said last week that the company shut down operations in late July following layoffs of hundreds of nonunion employees. The Wall Street Journal and FreightWaves reported in late July that the bankruptcy was coming \u2014 noting that customers had already started to leave the carrier in large numbers and that the company had stopped freight pickups. Those reports arrived just days after Yellow averted a strike from the Teamsters amid heated contract negotiations. A pension fund agreed to extend health benefits for workers at two Yellow Corp. operating companies, avoiding a planned walkout \u2014 and giving Yellow \u201c30 days to pay its bills,\u201d notably $50 million that Yellow failed to pay the Central States Health and Welfare Fund on July 15. Yellow blamed the nine-month talks for the demise of the company, saying it was unable to institute a new business plan to modernize operations and make it more competitive during that time. The company said it has asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware for permission to make payments, including for employee wages and benefits, taxes and certain vendors essential to its businesses. Yellow has racked up hefty bills over the years. As of late March, Yellow had an outstanding debt of about $1.5 billion. Of that, $729.2 million was owed to the federal government. In 2020, under the Trump administration, the Treasury Department granted the company a $700 million pandemic-era loan on national security grounds. A congressional probe recently concluded that the Treasury and Defense departments \u201cmade missteps\u201d in the decision and noted that Yellow\u2019s \u201cprecarious financial position at the time of the loan, and continued struggles, expose taxpayers to a significant risk of loss.\u201d The government loan is due in September 2024. As of March, Yellow had made $54.8 million in interest payments and repaid just $230 million of the principal owed, according to government documents. The financial chaos at Yellow \u201cis probably two decades in the making,\u201d said Stifel research director Bruce Chan, pointing to poor management and strategic decisions dating back to the early 2000s. \u201cAt this point, after each party has bailed them out so many times, there is a limited appetite to do that anymore.\u201d",

Firefighters were responding to a blaze in the Southern California community of Cabazon when it was reported that the fire had extended into vegetation, requiring a \"full wildland fire dispatch,\" including fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, CalFire Southern Region Chief David Fulcher said in a news conference. Firefighters with both CalFire and the Riverside County Fire Department were involved in the response, he said. While engaged in the firefight, two helicopters responding to the incident collided, Fulcher said. The first helicopter was able to land safely nearby, but the second crashed, killing all three people onboard, he said. The three killed were identified only as a CalFire division chief, a CalFire captain and a contracted pilot. Fulcher said the crash also caused an additional four-acre fire, which firefighters were able to extinguish. \"This was a tragic loss for the community, the fire service committee and Cal Fire Riverside County Fire Department,\" Fulcher said. He said the cause of the collision was still under investigation, with the National Transportation Safety Board investigating the crash.  The office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a post on X, the social media platform formally known as Twitter, that it was in \"close coordination\" with CalFire after the helicopter crash.  ",

The first lady of Florida was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021. The couple has been married since 2010, and have three children \u2014 Madison, Mason and Mamie. In their first network interview since DeSantis launched his campaign for president, Casey DeSantis told NBC News correspondent Dasha Burns that she received her cancer diagnosis when her children were 4, 3 and 1 years old. \u201cAnd at that time, we didn\u2019t really know what was going to happen, right? You never know when something like that comes upon your family,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I had to rely on him in a really big way.\u201d \"There were times when I was going through six rounds of chemotherapy,\" she added. \"I was going through six weeks of radiation, and three surgeries. And I couldn\u2019t get up. Couldn\u2019t do very many things. I couldn\u2019t pick up my 3 year old, when they wanted me to hold him. And I had to tell him a little bit of a fib, that Mommy\u2019s arm hurts. And I have to go back to the hospital because it\u2019s about my arm. It wasn\u2019t about the arm. To this day, they have no idea of what I\u2019ve been through.\u201d Casey DeSantis said she\u2019s never told her kids about her battle with cancer because they\u2019re not \u201cold enough to really understand what that means,\u201d but that they plan to tell them about it \u201cat some point.\u201d She went on to praise her husband for stepping in to take care of their children as she struggled with cancer. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going through opportunities where you can barely scrape yourself off the bathroom floor, because you\u2019re sick, and your children are calling for you, and you physically cannot get to them, but you have somebody who is not only running the state of Florida, and who\u2019s there for the people of his state, he was there for me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he was there to go pick up my kids when I couldn\u2019t. And he did it with humility. And he did it with love,\u201d she added, while holding back tears. \u201cAnd I tell you what, can\u2019t ask for a better husband than that.\u201d Asked how it feels to hear his wife say that, the governor said: \u201cWell, look. That\u2019s in sickness and in health. That\u2019s what you sign up for.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not only my wife, she\u2019s my best friend. And she\u2019s the person that I\u2019ve always dreamed to be the mother of my children. And so this is just what you do,\u201d he said. Casey DeSantis, 43, a former producer and Emmy award-winning television show host, made her first solo public appearance of her husband\u2019s presidential campaign last month, launching Mamas for DeSantis in a suburb of Des Moines. Talking about their roles as parents \u2014 and mobilizing other parents \u2014 has emerged as a key part of the campaign\u2019s strategy. Casey DeSantis is her husband's most trusted adviser and a significant draw at his events. She is frequently at his side during his campaign stops and often shakes hands and takes pictures with Republican attendees. The Mamas for DeSantis initiative launched in June last year as an arm of the governor\u2019s re-election campaign, with a mission to mobilize mothers and grandmothers across Florida. The group initially set a goal of signing up 1 million \u201cmamas\u201d and hit 1.1 million by Election Day, according to the campaign.",

In widely circulated video clips on social media, the crowd is heard booing and chanting \u201cretire\u201d and \u201clost the Senate\u201d as McConnell, who has long been a target of criticism from his party's right wing, especially after he turned on former President Donald Trump, said that he and his wife, Elaine, are \u201cexcited to be back\u201d at the event featuring Democratic and Republican speakers. \u201cMy friends, I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s not hard for Republicans to look good these days,\u201d McConnell said amid boos. McConnell did not acknowledge the jeers from the crowd throughout his speech. He criticized Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who sat behind him during his remarks and is up for re-election this year, for Covid-19 restrictions. McConnell\u2019s office did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment. Trump, whom McConnell fell out with after he condemned the then-president after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, mocked the GOP leader in a Truth Social post on Monday. \u201cI AGREE!,\" Trump, a Republican presidential candidate wrote. \u201cBOOOOO\u2014RETIRE, RETIRE, RETIRE\u2014BOOOOO!!!\u201d McConnell spoke at the annual event amid intensified concerns over his health. He appeared to freeze for 19 seconds during a weekly Republican leadership news conference last month, went silent and was walked away by Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, a top McConnell deputy. He walked back to the news conference a few minutes later. Asked about his health, he said he was fine. Asked whether he can do his job, he said: \u201cYeah.\u201d His office said he felt lightheaded and stepped away briefly. McConnell swiftly sought to tamp down speculation about his future and vowed to serve his full term as Republican leader after the health incident. His two-year term as Senate GOP leader ends in early January 2025. He became the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history earlier this year. The health incident added to a series of others this year, which began in March when he was hospitalized with a concussion and a minor rib fracture and was discharged days later before he entered rehab. He didn\u2019t return to the Senate, however, until mid-April. Earlier this month, he tripped and fell at a Washington, D.C., airport, NBC News reported. He was not seriously injured.",

NBC affiliate WSFA of Montgomery reported that four arrest warrants have been issued in connection with the altercation. Video of the incident has not been verified by NBC News. It appears to show brawling that split combatants along racial lines. The fighting appeared to follow a riverboat's attempt to dock where a pontoon boat was moored. A man who was apparently from the riverboat walked to the pontoon and exchanged words with someone, precipitating an all-out brawl between people associated with each of the watercraft. Reed indicated that the man from the riverboat was attacked and that those who committed violence against him would face the justice system. \"The Montgomery Police Department acted swiftly to detain several reckless individuals for attacking a man who was doing his job,\" he said.

        "title": "World scout jamboree in South Korea evacuated as storm Khanun looms",
        "content": "South Korea is preparing to evacuate tens of thousands of scouts from a coastal jamboree site as Tropical Storm Khanun looms, officials said Monday. Starting Tuesday morning, South Korea will deploy about a thousand buses to pull out some 36,000 scouts from 156 countries from the World Scout Jamboree in the southwestern county of Buan, according to Kim Sung-ho, a vice minister at South Korea\u2019s Ministry of the Interior and Safety. He said most of the scouts will be accommodated at venues in the country\u2019s capital, Seoul, and the nearby metropolitan area. Officials were trying to secure spaces at government training centers and education facilities. Kim said it would take six hours or more to evacuate the scouts from the campsite, which organizers said will no longer be used for any event after they leave. The announcement came after The World Organization of the Scout Movement said it urgently called on South Korea to quickly move the scouts from the storm\u2019s path and \u201cprovide all necessary resources and support for participants during their stay and until they return to their home countries.\u201d South Korea\u2019s weather agency reported that Khanun was expected to make landfall in South Korea on Thursday morning, potentially packing winds as strong as 118 to 154 kilometers (73 to 95 miles) per hour. Large swaths of the country\u2019s south, including Buan, could be affected by the storm as early as Wednesday, the agency said. President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s office said he called for \u201ccontingency\u201d plans, which could include relocating them to hotels and other facilities in the country\u2019s capital, Seoul, and nearby metropolitan areas. Khanun has taken an unusual, meandering path around Japan\u2019s southwestern islands for more than a week, dumping heavy rain, knocking out power to thousands of homes and disrupting flights and train services. On Monday afternoon, it had sustained winds of 108 kilometers (67 miles) per hour, with higher gusts, and was forecast to maintain that strength as it brushed Japan\u2019s main island of Kyushu this week, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The agency said the storm was at about 160 kilometers (99 miles) east of Amami city on Japan\u2019s southern main island of Kyushu and moving gradually toward the north as of Monday afternoon. It warned residents in affected regions to watch out for mudslides, high winds and rough seas. The storm has caused one death and 70 injuries on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, according to the country\u2019s Fire and Disaster Management Agency. Due to the forecast of harsh weather in the region, West Japan Railway Co. said there was a possibility of suspending \u201cShinkansen\u201d bullet train services from Wednesday night to Thursday morning. Hot temperatures have already forced thousands of British and American scouts to leave the site, which is made on land reclaimed from sea. Hundreds of participants had been treated for heat-related ailments since the jamboree started on Wednesday. Long before the event\u2019s start, critics raised concerns about bringing such large numbers of young people to a vast, treeless area lacking protection from the summer heat. Organizers earlier on Monday were scurrying to come up with plans to evacuate the scouts ahead of the storm\u2019s arrival. Choi Chang-haeng, secretary-general of the jamboree\u2019s organizing committee, said organizers have secured more than 340 evacuation venues, including community centers and gyms, in regions near Buan. About 40,000 scouts \u2014 mostly teenagers \u2014 from 158 countries came to the jamboree, built on land reclaimed from the sea. About 4,500 were from the U.K., representing the largest national contingent, while about 1,000 were from the United States. South Korea categorizes Khanun as a typhoon, defined as a tropical storm with winds stronger than 61 kilometers (38 miles) per hour. South Korea\u2019s weather agency expects Khanun to weaken to a storm within the next five days.",

        "title": "Weighted sleep sacks are unsafe for infants, pediatricians\u2019 group says",
        "content": "The country\u2019s largest association of pediatricians is warning that a product designed to help infants sleep more soundly could be deadly.  The makers of weighted swaddles and sleep sacks liken them to a parent\u2019s hand resting gently on an infant\u2019s chest or to the sensation of \u201cbeing held and hugged.\u201d But the American Academy of Pediatrics says placing weight on babies while they\u2019re sleeping poses an alarming and potentially fatal risk \u2014 and the group is calling for a closer examination of the potential danger.  Weighted sleep sacks and swaddles could hypothetically increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome by making it harder for babies to arouse themselves in response to hazards, such as lack of oxygen, the AAP said in a letter Thursday to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and ASTM International, a technical standards development organization. \u201cWhy would anyone put a weight on top of a child\u2019s chest \u2014 particularly a newborn?\u201d said Dr. Michael Goodstein, a neonatologist and member of the AAP\u2019s task force on SIDS. Infants\u2019 rib cages are more elastic and flexible, so adding weight could also potentially compress their chests and affect their breathing, he said. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has not put out any warnings about infant deaths linked to weighted sleep sacks or swaddles. An agency database lists one infant who died while wearing a weighted sleep sack, though it\u2019s not clear whether the sleep sack played a role in her death. The 5-month-old girl\u2019s father discovered she wasn\u2019t breathing in March 2021, according to a report submitted to the agency by a medical examiner or coroner in Washington state. The baby had also been set down on an infant lounger, a pillow-like product that can pose a suffocation and asphyxiation risk. The brand of sleep sack wasn\u2019t listed on the report.  Dreamland Baby and Nested Bean, which make two of the best-known weighted sleep sacks, maintain that their products are safe.  Tara Williams, the founder and CEO of Dreamland Baby, said the AAP\u2019s safety concerns were \u201cspeculative\u201d and added that there was no evidence that weighted sleep products were responsible for any reported deaths or injuries.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have customers writing in saying, \u2018I felt like my baby couldn\u2019t roll, I felt like my baby couldn\u2019t breathe.\u2019 It just doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere is this coming from?\u201d Manasi Gangan, the founder and president of Nested Bean, said she remained hopeful that the AAP would change its position on weighted sleep sacks once the products were researched more thoroughly.  \u201cThe AAP has taken \u2014 and I understand why \u2014 an extremely conservative approach toward weighted blankets because of the popularity it has gained,\u201d Gangan said. She later added, \u201cThere is no evidence to support that our products impair sleep arousal in response to physiological needs.\u201d  There are no federal safety requirements or regulations for infant sleep sacks.   Williams is co-chairing an effort to create voluntary safety standards for infant wearable blankets \u2014 the broad term for sleep sacks and swaddles \u2014 through ASTM International, which develops standards for products through a collaborative process that is open to the public. The group working on wearable blankets includes industry representatives, consumer advocates, medical experts and Consumer Product Safety Commission staff members, and is examining both weighted and non-weighted products.  In its letter, the AAP announced that it is opposing the creation of a voluntary safety standard for weighted infant sleep products. Such a standard \u201cwill send parents and caregivers the incorrect message that these unnecessary products are safe,\u201d the AAP said in its letter. Consumer Product Safety Commission Chair Alex Hoehn-Saric said in a statement that the agency was aware of the AAP\u2019s concerns and that the agency\u2019s staff \u201cis taking a close look at these weighted products as part of a larger examination of wearable blankets.\u201d  He urged parents \u201cto shop carefully and consult with their pediatrician before buying any product that claims to improve baby health or help with sleep.\u201d  ASTM International said in an email that it valued input from all stakeholders and would ensure that the AAP\u2019s letter \u201cis given due consideration.\u201d  The AAP first advised parents against using \u201cweighted swaddles, weighted clothing or weighted objects on or near the baby\u201d a year ago, when it updated its safe sleep recommendations, saying the items \u201care not safe and not recommended.\u201d   Nested Bean and Dreamland Baby were created by entrepreneurs who said they were inspired by their own experiences as mothers of newborns who wouldn\u2019t sleep. Nested Bean's signature product is a sleep sack with a small weighted pouch that rests in the center of a baby's chest, which weighs 1 ounce for babies up to 6 months old. The company has attracted venture capital investment, and it had $15 million in sales in 2019, according to Forbes. The company declined to release recent sales figures.  Dreamland Baby\u2019s products are filled with plastic beads that distribute weight across infants\u2019 torsos. They are heavier, weighing nearly 13 ounces for babies up to 6 months old, and they spread the weight across a larger surface area. The company grew quickly after it launched a Kickstarter campaign and appeared on \u201cShark Tank\u201d in 2020. Dreamland Baby reached $10 million in revenue in 2021, it said in a news release, with more than 500,000 products having been sold to date. Dreamland Baby and Nested Bean have put safety at the forefront of their sales pitches: They say that their products are supported by medical professionals, research and testing and that they meet rigorous safety standards.  In its letter this week, the AAP points to preliminary data from an industry-commissioned study from March to support its concerns about weighted sleep products.  The study, commissioned by Nested Bean and conducted by a private engineering firm, doesn\u2019t conclude that weighted infant sleep products are either dangerous or safe. And its scope is limited: The study encompassed only five infants, used a two-minute test window, and wasn\u2019t peer-reviewed.  But the AAP described the preliminary data as \u201cevidence that the use of weight sleep products on infants can lead to lower oxygen levels, which if sustained, may be harmful to the developing infant\u2019s brain.\u201d  In the study, obtained by NBC News, researchers placed oval weights on infants\u2019 chests, similar to the design of Nested Bean\u2019s products, and gradually increased the weight from 1 ounce to about 9.5 ounces.  \u201cAs chest load increased, pulse rate increased and SpO2 generally decreased,\u201d the study concluded, referring to the level of oxygen in the blood. The decrease in oxygen level was statistically significant for all weights tested, while the increase in pulse rate was statistically significant for weights over 1 ounce. One baby repeatedly tried to remove the weight as it became heavier.  Average oxygen saturation levels remained above 95%, the range generally considered healthy for infants and adults, the study said. But it noted that there was the potential for oxygen saturation levels to \u201cdecline into unsafe levels\u201d during longer sleeping periods. Researchers also noted the potential for infants to experience fatigue \u2014 another risk factor that could compromise infants\u2019 ability to breathe, said Dr. Rachel Moon, the chair of the AAP\u2019s task force on SIDS.  \u201cIt\u2019s not the level, it\u2019s the trend I\u2019m worried about,\u201d Moon said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they let it go more than two minutes? You\u2019d want to know what\u2019s happening over 30 minutes, two hours.\u201d Gangan, the Nested Bean president, said the study gave no indication that her company\u2019s products were unsafe. She said its short test window was modeled on other research involving babies. \u201cIt is normal for SpO2 to fluctuate within healthy ranges, even when no load is applied,\u201d she said in an email.  Gangan pointed out that infants regularly experience pressure from tight car seat straps across their bodies and \u201chave hands or caregiver palms of various weights be placed on their bodies including on their chests.\u201d  The AAP said in its letter this week that federal regulators and ASTM should take a \u201cprecautionary approach\u201d towards new sleep products, rather than wait and see if they cause harm.   The AAP added that it wanted to \u201cavoid a repeat of what happened with inclined sleepers, in-bed sleepers, and other novel sleep-related products,\u201d which were ultimately linked to more than 100 deaths.  \u201cWaiting for the emergence of confirmatory data about these concerns while these products proliferate is an unacceptable outcome when each of those data points will be a family whose lives are forever marked by unfathomable tragedy of their infant dying from a sleep-related death,\" the AAP said. In interviews, Goodstein and Moon said more rigorous, peer-reviewed research is needed. \u201cYou should prove safety before you put a product out there,\u201d Goodstein said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be proving it after kids die.\u201d  Both Dreamland Baby and Nested Bean said that they are pursuing more in-depth research on the safety of weighted infant sleep products but that it will take time for these larger studies to be designed, completed and published in peer-reviewed journals.  Both companies have also continued citing the AAP\u2019s general recommendations for safe sleep on their websites, even after the group advised against the use of weighted swaddles and other infant sleep products last year.  \u201cFirst and foremost, all of our products have been designed according to the AAP\u2019s Guidelines for Safe Sleep,\u201d Nested Bean said on its website as of this week. Dreamland Baby\u2019s website also cited the AAP\u2019s safe sleep guideline in multiple blog entries, posted as recently as Tuesday, reiterating the group\u2019s recommendations to place babies on firm, flat sleep surfaces.  But none of those links mentioned the AAP\u2019s updated 2022 warning against using weighted sleep products for babies. After NBC News asked Dreamland Baby about the omission, the company added a note to its website Wednesday: \u201cThe AAP updated their guidelines in June 2022, and are not currently approving any weighted sleep solutions.\u201d  Nested Bean said in a statement that it removed all mentions of the AAP from its website last year and would address the link NBC News shared. \u201cAn older version seems to have resurfaced unintentionally on our website,\u201d Gangan said in an email Wednesday. \u201cThis will be promptly addressed this week.\u201d",

        "title": "John Fetterman Opens Up About His Battle With Depression",
        "content": "When he looks back on the past year\u2014a year in which he nearly died, became a U.S. Senator, and nearly died again\u2014it is the debate that John Fetterman identifies as the \u00adbreaking point. \u201cThe debate lit the mitch,\u201d he says, then shakes his head in frustration and tries again. The right word is there in his brain, but he struggles to get it out. \u201cExcuse me, that should be lit the mitch\u2014\u201d He stops and tries again. \u201cLit the match,\u201d he says finally. Oct. 25, 2022: the date is lodged in his mind. \u201cI knew I had to do it,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI knew that the voters deserve to have what, what the stroke has done to me\u2014transparency that way.\u201d As soon as it was over, he knew it had not gone well. \u201cI knew at that moment that I was going to be considered\u2014consider myself\u2014like, a national embarrassment,\u201d he says. And then the darkness came. The Pennsylvania Democrat is sitting behind a big wooden desk in his sparsely furnished Senate office. His 6-ft. 8-in. frame is clad in a white hoodie, gray sweat shorts, and sneakers\u2014a sartorial signature he has maintained despite Senate rules. (For most votes, Fetterman discovered, he can stand just off the Senate floor and give a thumbs-up or -down to the clerk, thereby avoiding having to put on a suit.) Surrounding us are three iPads propped up on stands\u2014two facing him, one facing outward\u2014that transcribe our conversation in real time, helping compensate for the auditory-\u00adprocessing difficulties brought by his stroke just over a year ago. Fetterman has settled in to talk, through tears, about his treatment for and recovery from the severe depression that followed. In February, he checked into the neuropsychiatry unit at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside D.C., where he remained for more than six weeks. By the time he got there, he was a shell of himself\u2014gaunt, listless, barely able to function. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could be fixed,\u201d he says. He didn\u2019t actively contemplate suicide, he tells me, but he would have welcomed death if it came. \u201cIf the doctor said, oh, by the way, you have six months left, I would have been like, OK, whatever,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how bleak it was.\u201d He considers himself lucky to have survived. Buy a print of the John Fetterman cover here Instead, Fetterman emerged transformed, he says, and has become an evangelist for the treatment he believes saved his life. This openness about a serious, ongoing mental-\u00adhealth ordeal has put Fetterman in uncharted territory for an American politician. A half-\u00adcentury ago, Senator Thomas Eagleton, selected as George McGovern\u2019s running mate, was dropped from the Democratic presidential ticket when it emerged he had previously been hospitalized for depression. Since then, other politicians have been more open about mental illness, but typically in the past tense. \u201cThere\u2019s been a transition in terms of stigma around these issues,\u201d says Minnesota Democrat Tina Smith, who disclosed her youthful battle with depression in a Senate floor speech in 2019. \u201cI was talking about my experiences when I was much younger. That\u2019s very different from the leap of faith John has taken.\u201d When Fetterman set out to shatter that long-standing taboo, it was far from clear what the response would be. But he has been met, by and large, with an outpouring of goodwill, from colleagues and the public alike. Senators of both parties have lauded him. People come up to him on street corners to tell him he saved their life. On a May day that I interviewed him in Washington, a suit-jacketed Republican congressional staffer carrying a Chick-fil-A takeout bag approached Fetterman to thank him for talking about his struggles. As he sat on a park bench in Philadelphia recently, a 28-year-old Black woman pressed a handwritten note into his hands: \u201cI just wanted to thank you for your bravery,\u201d it read. \u201cI have lived with \u00adBipolar II for years. You have opened a door that has profoundly change [sic] the conversation in my household and community!\u201d For so many years, we have demanded our politicians be perfect\u2014free of scandal, perfectly groomed, never a hair or a word out of place. To admit to being broken was to admit to being \u00addeficient. But Fetterman was never the kind of pol who put much stock in seeming perfect. And so he embarked on a high-stakes trust fall with the electorate of his diverse swing state, gambling that they would see him not as dangerously unstable but as recognizably human. It turned out that many people loved their broken Senator\u2014not in spite of his brokenness but \u00adbecause of it. The stroke left Fetterman\u2019s cognitive abilities intact, according to his doctors, and in hours of interviews in D.C. and Pennsylvania\u2014the most extensive he\u2019s given since his treatment\u2014his quick wit and grasp of policy were apparent. Though he may eventually recover full fluency with time and continued speech therapy, he sometimes struggles to express the words in his mind. But his meaning is clear. \u201cMy message is, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Trumper, MAGA, or hard leftist, or anyone in between. Depression comes across the spectrum, and get help with it,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Democratic Senator from Pennsylvania saying this. No. I\u2019m just a husband and a father, somebody that was suffering from depression and got help\u2014\u201d Here his voice breaks; he wipes his eyes, takes a moment to compose himself. He has turned sideways and curled up in his chair, as if trying to shrink inside himself. \u201c\u2014Before it was too late,\u201d he finally says. \u201cBefore some things could have\u2014damage that can\u2019t be undone. And I would just implore anybody to get help. Because it can work. It worked. And I\u2019m so grateful.\u201d The people closest to Fetterman always knew there was a darkness in him. \u201cJohn was always a sad person, and that was OK,\u201d says his wife Gisele Barreto Fetterman. \u201cHe\u2019d be like, \u2018I\u2019m not too sad, you\u2019re too happy.\u2019 He was just very empathetic, I think, and he carried the pain of so many. I thought of him as melancholic\u2014I always loved Abraham Lincoln, and historians would call him melancholy, which we later learned was really clinical depression. And I thought, oh, he\u2019s my Abraham Lincoln. It wasn\u2019t something I wanted to change about him.\u201d Born to working-class teenage parents in Reading, Pa., Fetterman, 53, grew up upper-middle-class in York after his father found success in the insurance industry. He played offensive tackle at Albright College, his dad\u2019s alma mater, then got an M.B.A. at the University of Connecticut, planning to follow his Republican father into the family business. But when Fetterman was 24, his best friend died in a car accident, prompting a round of soul-searching. He signed up for AmeriCorps, which sent him to work with low-income kids in Pittsburgh. After earning a degree from Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, he returned to western Pennsylvania to run a G.E.D. program in Braddock, a majority-Black former steel town. Braddock\u2019s population had declined precipitously; poverty and violence were rampant. Fetterman ran for mayor in 2005 on a reform platform, beating the incumbent by a single vote in the Democratic primary. As mayor, he turned the town into a showcase for hipster urban renewal\u2014art studios, organic gardens\u2014with help from a foundation funded by his father. He tattooed the local ZIP code, 15104, on one big forearm; on the other, he inked the dates of every murder in Braddock during his tenure. Irreverent, unpretentious, and progressive, the big man with the soft heart was catnip to coastal media, featured in glossy magazine profiles and on thought-leader panels. He was re-elected three times. In 2007, a formerly undocumented Brazilian immigrant, Gisele Barreto Almeida, wrote Fetterman a letter saying she admired his efforts. He invited her to visit Braddock. They fell in love and were married a year later. Fetterman made a bid for Senate in 2016, losing the Democratic primary to a conventional candidate preferred by the \u00adDemocratic \u00adestablishment who went on to lose the general election. Two years later, he defeated the incumbent lieutenant governor in the Democratic primary, earning a spot on the ticket with incumbent Governor Tom Wolf, a straitlaced former businessman. He refused the official residence that came with the job to remain in Braddock. Nor was he much for ceremonial glad-handing. Pennsylvania political insiders I asked about Fetterman\u2019s tenure described him as a \u201cloner\u201d and a \u201cgrump.\u201d The lieutenant governor has few official duties, but Fetterman managed to make waves. He hung gay-pride and marijuana-leaf flags from his office balcony, even after the legislature banned the practice. In his role overseeing the pardon board, he pushed to dramatically increase commutations and pardons. In February 2021, Fetterman announced he would again run for Senate. As 2022 dawned, he had a huge lead on his primary opponents. He was drawing big crowds and an avalanche of small-dollar donations. He would sometimes complain he didn\u2019t feel well, but it never seemed serious. On May 13, 2022\u2014the Friday before the Tuesday primary election\u2014Fetterman was in the car with Gisele, heading to a campaign event near Lancaster, when she noticed his face seemed to be drooping on one side. They drove straight to the hospital. Four days later, Fetterman won the primary in a landslide. He spent the day of his victory anesthetized, having a pacemaker implanted in his heart. Before going under the knife, he recorded a video on his iPhone: a message to his children, in case he didn\u2019t make it. From the earliest days after the stroke, doctors said a full recovery was eventually possible. Staffers and family members could detect glimpses of the old John in the way he cracked jokes and intuited the rhythms of the race. In the months when the recovery kept him off the campaign trail, he personally directed a savagely funny social media blitz depicting celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, his Republican opponent, as an out-of-touch carpetbagger. Oz could have drawn on the soft-touch persona he\u2019d honed on The Oprah Winfrey Show to compassionately address Fetterman\u2019s health. Instead he mocked him. \u201cIf John Fetterman had ever eaten a vegetable in his life, then maybe he wouldn\u2019t have had a major stroke,\u201d a spokeswoman taunted. Later, Oz\u2019s campaign aired ads showing Fetterman struggling to speak. The Senate campaign would eventually go down as history\u2019s most expensive\u2014a $300 million barrage of attacks that Fetterman believes exacerbated his depressive slide. Returning to the trail in August, Fetterman would ask audience members to raise their hand if they or their close relatives had experienced serious health problems. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been through this; I\u2019m just doing it in the public eye,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cAnd I have a doctor who\u2019s making fun of me, and I hope you don\u2019t have that in your life.\u201d The strategy was a product both of necessity and of Fetterman\u2019s political persona, says Joe Calvello, his communications director. \u201cWe made a bet on empathy\u2014that people are going to relate,\u201d Calvello says. It worked, he believes, because it was consistent with the Fetterman people knew. \u201cHis politics is about struggle,\u201d Calvello says. \u201cAs mayor, as lieutenant governor, he was always about the forgotten places, the forgotten communities, the people left behind.\u201d Yet even many who sympathized wondered whether Fetterman was up to the job. The election\u2019s lone debate loomed as the chance to prove himself. He prepared furiously. The format had never been a strength, but he did well enough in prep sessions that his camp felt optimistic. Read More: How John Fetterman Beat Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania. Fetterman now believes that debate will be remembered for decades as a debacle, like the time Dan Quayle couldn\u2019t spell potato. His voice cracked; he stammered; he struggled to say his own name. When he managed to string words together, they were often the wrong ones. Asked to explain his support for fracking, which he had previously opposed, he stammered, \u201cI do support fracking, and I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t\u2014I support fracking, and I stand, and I do support fracking.\u201d The reaction was brutal. Fetterman\u2019s own polls predicted he would lose the election. Two weeks later, he won by 5 points. Fetterman felt only numbness. Superstitious, and assuming it would take days to count votes, he hadn\u2019t prepared a victory speech. \u201cWe\u2019re all jumping up and down, and he\u2019s just in dis\u00adbelief,\u201d his adviser Rebecca Katz recalls. \u201cHe went out and declared victory, and then we all went home.\u201d And the darkness descended. The newly elected members of Congress were invited to an orientation in D.C. the week after the election. Gisele had to force her husband to go. \u201cThink of the insanity of that,\u201d Fetterman says. \u201cI work for two years. And at the end of that, after nearly dying, after the most infamous debate in American politics, I was going to not show up for orientation. That\u2019s what depression does.\u201d In news photographs from that event, Fetterman looks grim and uncomfortable. Surrounded by eager new lawmakers, his eyes are dim, his smile grudging. Colleagues remember wondering why he barely spoke or made eye contact. Back in Braddock, the Senator wouldn\u2019t get out of bed. Not for family meals at restaurants. Not for school activities for the three kids\u2014Karl, 14; Grace, 11; and August, 9. At Thanksgiving, he came to the table for a few minutes, downed some food, and went back to bed, while Gisele and the children kept up the family tradition of watching Planes, Trains and Automobiles. At Christmas, Gisele handled Santa duty. \u201cMy family was really confused, my kids especially,\u201d Fetterman says. \u201c\u2018Why, Daddy, I thought you won. Why wouldn\u2019t you be happier? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019 And I tried to explain to them that, oh, Daddy\u2019s tired. But I could begin to sense that they were blaming themselves.\u201d It still torments him, the helplessness and guilt that his children must have felt. \u201cThey realized that something was really wrong, and they started to get more and more scared,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t articulate to them, because I couldn\u2019t really articulate it to myself at this point, what was going on.\u201d Read More: How John Fetterman Is Using Assistive Technology in the Senate. While other newly elected lawmakers worked to get their offices up and running, aides struggled to get Fetterman to engage. \u201cAt first it seemed like he was just having a hard time getting out of campaign mode,\u201d recalls Adam Jentleson, his chief of staff. \u201cHe was always talking about how Republicans would leap on every mistake\u2014\u2018They\u2019re going to kill me with that.\u2019 I kept saying, you\u2019re not running anymore, you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d He became obsessed with a mini-scandal surrounding pollster Sean McElwee, who had done work for the campaign before resigning from his firm over his gambling on elections and ties to the disgraced crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried. \u201cAt freshman orientation he was completely preoccupied with people talking behind his back,\u201d Jentleson says. \u201cI had to constantly reassure him that everything wasn\u2019t a crisis.\u201d The winter was dark and cold. Fetterman\u2019s D.C. apartment was in a basement. So was his temporary office suite in the Capitol. On Jan. 10, the New York Times journalist Blake Hounshell died by suicide at 44, leaving behind a wife and two young children. Fetterman had gotten to know Hounshell, a fellow stroke survivor, during the campaign. Hounshell had largely recovered from his stroke, but continued to suffer nerve pain that exacerbated the depression that had plagued him since he was a young man. (The physical and psychological effects of stroke frequently contribute to depression in survivors.) The news that Hounshell had taken his life hit Fetterman hard. On Feb. 8, Senate Democrats held a retreat at the Library of Congress in D.C. Fetterman sat by himself and didn\u2019t talk to anybody. \u201cI was sitting with my wife at a table next to him, and it was clear he was not having a good day,\u201d recalls Bob Casey, Pennsylvania\u2019s senior Senator. \u201cI attributed it to him being a little shy, which he is\u2014you know, he\u2019s not the most extroverted person. And he was still in the early stages of using the iPad to deal with his auditory-\u00adprocessing issues.\u201d Fetterman stumbled out of the retreat in a fog. Fearing he was having another stroke, his staff took him to George Washington University hospital, where he stayed for two nights, receiving fluids and getting tests. The following Monday, he consulted Congress\u2019s attending physician, Brian Monahan, who diagnosed him with depression, recommended inpatient treatment, and began making arrangements for him to be admitted at Walter Reed. Finally, on Feb. 15, after pleading from staff and family members\u2014Fetterman remembers it as an \u201cintervention\u201d\u2014he agreed. Jentleson and another Fetterman staffer, Bobby Maggio, escorted him out of the building. \u201cI will always remember walking to his car parked a block away, thinking, \u2018Please don\u2019t change your mind,\u2019\u201d Jentleson recalls. \u201cHe\u2019s a large man, and if he decided he didn\u2019t want to go, there was going to be nothing me and Bobby could do about it.\u201d It was 5 p.m., and the car inched along in rush-hour traffic. The drive took an hour. Fetterman sat silently in the back, not saying a word. For the first two weeks at Walter Reed, Fetterman continued to decline. He stopped shaving and showering. His normally bare head grew fuzzy; his fingernails were like claws; he didn\u2019t get out of his pajamas. Seeing his face in the mirror, he didn\u2019t recognize himself. He was consumed with self-loathing, convinced his own family wanted nothing to do with him. He knew he belonged in the hospital, but felt trapped there. Dr. David Williamson, director of \u00adWalter Reed\u2019s inpatient neuropsychiatry program, oversaw Fetterman\u2019s treatment. \u201cDepression to the public connotes sadness. It wasn\u2019t so much a sadness presentation,\u201d Williamson tells me. \u201cThe cardinal feature of the medical illness of depression is slowed speech, movement, and a lack of drive or initiative. He was very passive, very flat, very unemotional, almost mute, although he did talk. Just a lack of responsiveness and a flatness, a lack of that spark or passion you would expect to see in humans.\u201d Williamson\u2019s team gathered records from Fetterman\u2019s doctors in D.C. and Pennsylvania and ran tests\u2014\u201ca 360-\u00addegree review of his cardiac health, neurologic health, mental state, behavior, and daily functioning,\u201d as Williamson puts it. They found, among other things, that Fetterman\u2019s hearing was severely diminished, exacerbating his auditory issues; he now wears hearing aids. Because he\u2019d lost so much weight, his heart medications were at too high a dosage. Cardiac tests and brain scans showed he had not suffered any further physical damage or stroke. (Fetterman gave his doctor permission to discuss his treatment with me, but declined to disclose the names and dosages of his medications.) After a couple of weeks of medication adjustment, Fetterman began to improve, Williamson says. His sleep got better; he began to show more emotion, regain his sense of humor. Williamson sought to educate Fetterman about his illness, to get him to see that it was not mere sadness but a medical condition rooted in brain chemistry. The Senator seemed unconvinced until, one weekend, Williamson persuaded him to read Understanding Depression, a book by Dr. Raymond \u00adDePaulo. \u201cI came in on Monday morning and he was so \u00adanimated,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cHe had bookmarked and dog-eared and highlighted whole sections of that book.\u201d Gisele, it turned out, had given Fetterman the same book a decade earlier, but he hadn\u2019t read it. Fetterman began to venture outside, into the ward\u2019s sunny courtyard. But he still refused to see his family until one day a staff therapist said something that flipped a switch. \u201cThe therapist, she\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, your wife and your kids want to come, what do you think?\u2019 And I was like, no, no, the kids don\u2019t want to see me. I ruined my son\u2019s birthday. I haven\u2019t been a participant in their lives for the last couple of months. And the moment that changed everything was when that young therapist said, \u2018Kids need their daddy\u2019s hugs.\u2019\u201d He chokes up at the memory of it: it was so simple, so clear, so suddenly obvious. Gisele brought the family, and they picked up a packet of Post-it notes that Fetterman\u2019s father had left to help him with his reading. In black ballpoint pen, they covered the neon pink, yellow, and blue stickies with pictures and messages: \u201cWe love you,\u201d \u201cBest dad ever,\u201d \u201cYOU WILL GET BETTER.\u201d Recounting this memory at the house in Braddock, Fetterman pauses our conversation and lopes back to the bedroom to retrieve the Post-its. There are more than 100 of them, preserved in a wood frame. \u201cI\u2019m going to save these till the day I die,\u201d he says, crying. \u201cTheir visit was really kind of a pivot, where I realized that this is a choice. You have the support, you have the medical community, you have therapy. And this was a catalyst that helped direct me to the way forward.\u201d The final two weeks of his hospital stay were spent fine-tuning a treatment regimen. On March 31, he left the ward and went home to Gisele and the kids. On April 17, he returned to the Senate. Williamson says Fetterman\u2019s depression is now in remission. \u201cHis prognosis is good,\u201d the doctor adds, \u201cprovided that he continues to take his medication, and he\u2019s very strongly committed to medication and treatment over the long term.\u201d The senator and his team never considered trying to hide the cause of his hospitalization at Walter Reed. \u201cWe were never for a minute going to say he was being \u2018treated for exhaustion,\u2019\u201d Katz says. But they weren\u2019t sure what the reaction would be when they first announced he\u2019d been admitted. As they hit \u201csend\u201d on the press release, Jentleson and Calvello recall holding their breath and exchanging a here-goes-\u00adnothing glance. They needn\u2019t have worried. Lawmakers from both parties expressed support, in public and private. \u201cHeidi & I are lifting John up in prayer. Mental illness is real & serious,\u201d tweeted Texas Republican Ted Cruz. Tina Smith, the Minnesota Democrat, brought doughnuts to his staff, who were soon overwhelmed with similar gifts from Republicans and Democrats alike. Republican Senator Katie Britt of Alabama, Fetterman\u2019s neighbor in the Capitol basement, was among the first colleagues to visit him in the hospital. (Though both have moved to better offices, their bond endures: crossing paths in a Capitol tunnel one recent afternoon, Fetterman yelled, \u201cAlabama!\u201d and gave her a fist bump.) \u201cUnsolicited, so many colleagues have expressed both publicly and privately their appreciation that he did this,\u201d says Democratic Senator Peter Welch of Vermont, who notes that the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath triggered a widespread mental-health crisis that the nation is struggling to address. \u201cA lot of citizens have too. It was a powerful and a helpful thing that he did.\u201d Constituents flooded Fetterman\u2019s office with messages of support. \u201cAttached below is today\u2019s call report,\u201d reads the daily internal email tabulating constituent calls to his Washington office from Feb. 16, the day he went public. \u201cTotal number of calls: 56. Top call topics: 1) Well wishes for the Senator\u201432.\u201d No other topic had more than two callers. That pattern continued throughout his hospitalization. Williamson believes Fetterman\u2019s openness about his struggles has the power to help countless others. In a recent Gallup survey, 18% of Americans said they have depression\u2014a rate that has nearly doubled in the past decade. Studies have found that fewer than 10% of sufferers get psychiatric treatment. \u201cWe struggle in the health care world to message this condition to the public,\u201d Williamson says. \u201cPeople feel like losing their drive, their emotional repertoire, their passion, that these things are somehow an indictment of their personality or something that they\u2019ve done wrong. If you get chest pains, most people know that\u2019s bad and you\u2019ve got to go to the ER. We need to get there with depression, and the way we\u2019re going to get there is when public figures like Senator Fetterman speak out and say help is out there and you can get better.\u201d May 16, 2023: a normal day in the life of an abnormal U.S. Senator. In the morning, Fetterman meets with the CEO of Ikea; later, he will receive the family of an American held prisoner in Russia. The meetings will be awkward for all involved. Fetterman is still learning to navigate his limitations, and for the most part, he expects everyone else to adapt. The day\u2019s main event is a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee. The former executives of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which failed in March and were taken over by federal regulators, are set to testify. Fetterman, the most junior of the 23 Senators on the committee, is scheduled to speak last. In his first-floor suite in the Russell building, his staff brainstorms ways to channel the righteous indignation Fetterman feels toward the executives\u2014fat cats, as he sees them, who got off easy and left the little guy holding the bag. \u201cNone of the Democrats are being big enough a\u2013holes to this guy,\u201d Jentleson says as he watches the start of the hearing. They land on the idea of berating the former SVB boss, Gregory Becker, for jetting off on a Hawaiian vacation the same day he was ousted as CEO. As the hearing nears the two-hour mark, Fetterman changes into a suit and heads through the Capitol\u2019s winding underground passages. With his hulking posture and lumbering gait, he is impossible to miss, and he is repeatedly stopped for selfies. Other than that, he walks in silence. His body man, Luke Borwegen, holds the iPad in front of him, but the ambient hubbub has rendered it useless. Shortly before his turn to speak, the plan goes out the window. Britt, the Alabama Republican, has also latched onto the Hawaii tidbit and is grilling Becker about taking the trip while declining to return his bonus. Fetterman has to come up with a new angle on the fly. He settles on a complex idea related to the debt-ceiling negotiations, in which some Republicans called for work requirements for recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps. If poor people have to prove they\u2019re working to collect taxpayer-funded benefits, Fetterman wants to know, shouldn\u2019t CEOs getting billion-dollar bailouts have to do the same? That\u2019s the idea, at least. But when Fetterman takes his seat and sets out to make his point, what comes out is less clear. \u201cThe Republicans want to give a work requirement for SNAP, for a hungry family has to have this kind of penalties, some kinds of word\u2014working requirements,\u201d he stammers. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you have a working requirement after we sail your bank\u2014billions of your bank? Because they seem to be more preoccupied when, then, SNAP requirements for works, for hungry people, but not about protecting the tax\u2014the taxpapers, you know, that will bail no matter whatever does about a bank crashing?\u201d The executives aren\u2019t sure how to react. \u00adDumbfounded or confused, they don\u2019t answer. By late afternoon, Fetterman\u2019s questioning becomes the subject of more than 30,000 tweets. Some of them are from the left, celebrating the point he was trying to make. But the exchange \u00adreally goes viral on the right, with critics mocking his inarticulateness. Fox News airs three segments on his performance. GOP Representative Ronny Jackson of Texas, the former White House physician, calls Fetterman \u201can absolute disgrace,\u201d adding, \u201cHe\u2019s completely incapable of doing the job he was sent here to do.\u201d Many on the right remain obsessed with the idea that Fetterman is, as Tucker Carlson once put it, \u201cunapologetically brain-\u00addamaged.\u201d Borwegen, the bearer of the iPad, went on a couple of Bumble dates with a woman who kept prodding him to admit that his boss was incapacitated, only to find out that she was actually an operative surreptitiously taping their encounters for the right-wing activist James O\u2019Keefe. The video, posted in May, contains no such admission. Once, these types of attacks would have sent Fetterman spiraling. Today he\u2019s able to let the negativity slide. He\u2019s no longer on social media. \u201cSo anyone who reads your article and thinks, Goddammit, I\u2019m throwing my A+ material \u00addirectly at John, the good news is, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying!\u201d he jokes. The freshman lawmaker is beginning to carve out his identity in the Senate. He co-\u00adsponsored pending bipartisan rail-safety legislation in response to the February Norfolk Southern train derailment, which occurred just over the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. In May, he joined other Democrats in calling on President Biden to use the 14th Amendment to raise the debt ceiling unilaterally. The following month, he was one of five Democratic Senators to oppose the debt deal negotiated by Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a vote that put him in the same camp as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. \u201cHonestly, I swear, I don\u2019t consider myself a progressive,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just a guy with three kids, and it scares me to death that a bank president 3,000 miles away can crash and blow up, like, my kids\u2019 college savings or whatever. I don\u2019t call that progressive. I call that an outrage.\u201d On a sweaty Saturday in June, the Fettermans line up for the start of the Pittsburgh Pride Parade. Gisele wears a rainbow-\u00adstriped cotton sundress, while the Senator, clad in his usual work shirt and sweat shorts, has draped a full-size rainbow flag over his shoulders like a superhero cape. He had to miss last year\u2019s parade, which was soon after his stroke. A pair of Black women in matching rainbow jerseys approach and are enveloped in Fetterman\u2019s embrace. A decade ago, as mayor of Braddock, he began marrying same-sex couples in defiance of state law. Princess and Judy Craighead were the first Black couple he married, and have stayed friends with the Fettermans ever since. \u201cWe wore dashikis at the ceremony, so he wanted to wear one too, so we had to find a dashiki in size 5XL,\u201d laughs Princess, 57, who works in a restaurant. Judy, 65, a disabled Army veteran, says her elderly mother suffers from aphasia. \u201cSame as him, the stuff you want to come out doesn\u2019t come out right all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut she\u2019s still the same person.\u201d Other Democratic elected officials make a quick appearance and leave, but not Fetterman. He starts at the front of the parade but quickly falls back to the rear, stopping every few feet for selfies, hugs, and fist bumps. Young people squeal like they\u2019ve just seen Taylor Swift. A stocky white woman in jean shorts buries her head in his chest. Diane DeGregorio, 58, is a Teamster who works on the loading dock of the nearby convention center. \u201cI suffer from depression, but it\u2019s not something you talk about,\u201d she tells me. \u201cHopefully, with him admitting it and getting treated, it lets more people know that it\u2019s OK to say you have a problem, especially men that look like him.\u201d After the parade, Fetterman settles into an easy chair by a window in the converted car dealership in Braddock that his family calls home. It\u2019s a massive, loftlike space with exposed-brick walls, full of salvaged furniture and thrift-store finds. The three kids are getting ready to go to the pool. Two rescue dogs, Levi and Artie, roam the premises. Fetterman, in his sardonic fashion, wants me to know he\u2019s aware how cheesy some of his newfound gratitude sounds. \u201cLike, you know, when I was getting out, I didn\u2019t think, \u2018Woo-hoo! I\u2019m on top of the world!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut, like, you have a life to live, and you\u2019re excited to live those\u2014that life. And knock on wood, every day has been wonderful. And now I have a duty to pay it forward. Because I\u2019ll be honest with you, I would be scared where I would be right now if I didn\u2019t have the kind of help that I got at Walter Reed. And it\u2019s a shame that those types of resources are not available to everyone. But what is available is that I have a duty to be a champion of that.\u201d In retrospect, Fetterman believes that what happened to him was inevitable\u2014that his natural melancholy would combine with the stroke and the \u201cblowtorch\u201d of the campaign to ignite his depression. While he knows many see him as diminished or disabled, he believes what he\u2019s been through has made him stronger: wiser, more thoughtful, more appreciative. \u201cI thought I was really empathetic before, but after the stroke, and then after this\u2014I think it made me a much better Senator.\u201d What he wants now, he says, is to be the voice that might have pulled him out of the darkness.\u2014With reporting by Julia Zorthian",

        "title": "Ukraine counter-offensive against Russia yields only small gains in first 2 months",
        "content": "The war in Ukraine has reached a critical point. Where it goes from here could decide the country's future and affect the security of Europe. In the 18 months since Russia invaded, the Ukrainians have mostly been on the defensive, preventing Moscow's forces from seizing more territory. But this summer, Ukraine - with the help of billions of pounds of Western military equipment - has gone on the attack, attempting to expel the Russians from land they previously captured in the east and south of the country. Two months into this counter-offensive, and with time of the essence before the onset of winter, are Ukrainian troops making any real progress? Working with BBC Verify, we have analysed video of the fighting and spoken to experts to try to answer that question. One look at a large-scale map of eastern and southern Ukraine shows that not much has changed in the two months since the counter-offensive began. Russia still occupies nearly one-fifth of Ukraine - including the cities of Donetsk, in the east, and Mariupol, which it captured after months of siege - and its forces are well dug in. In fact, not much has changed in the nine months since November 2022, when Ukraine made its last significant gain, retaking the southern city of Kherson and large areas in the north-east. But it hasn't all been bad news for Ukraine. It says its troops have recently retaken the village of Staromaiorske in the Donetsk region. The BBC has verified video which supports that claim. Around Bakhmut, in the east, where there has been intense fighting, Ukraine has also regained some small areas that it lost earlier in the summer. And it has also made small gains in the Zaporizhzhia region in the south - a key area where Ukraine really needs to make a decisive difference. A Ukrainian push through the swathe of Russian-held territory to the Sea of Azov would disrupt Russia's supply routes and cut off their forces in Russian-annexed Crimea and further west. The map below shows where ground has been retaken. The large red areas indicate Russian-controlled areas, the purple ones are territory held, or regained, by Ukraine. The black circles show just how heavily the Russians have fortified this region. The city of Tokmak, for example, has a ring of fortifications around it - as BBC Verify revealed in May. In two months Ukrainian troops have advanced, at most, about 10 miles (16km) in two areas along the region's 100-mile (160km) front, according to independent analysis. Progress is being made, but it is slower than Ukraine and its Western allies had hoped. Ukrainian forces have been attacking on three fronts, using Western-supplied equipment and training, and probing for weak spots along the entire 700-mile (1,125km) front line. But the Russians foresaw their intentions, and they have spent months building the most extensive fortifications in recent history. Triple layers of trenches, bunkers, concrete pyramid tank-traps (so-called \"dragon's teeth\") and ditches - laced with thousands of landmines - present a massive obstacle to any Ukrainian advance, as illustrated in the satellite image below, taken near Tokmak. Marina Miron, a defence expert at King's College London, says Ukraine has had to scale back its ambitions in the south, including aspirations to take back Crimea. \"I don't think that will happen anytime soon,\" she says. Dr Miron says the best they can hope for is potentially retaking Tokmak, which lies on a key route in the south-east of the country - an area which acts as a logistical hub for Russian forces. Back in June, Ukraine sent an armoured column south towards Tokmak and quickly ran into trouble. Videos shared on social media, which BBC Verify cross-checked to compare locations and the types of military vehicles, showed newly-supplied western Leopard tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles hitting a minefield and then being attacked by Russian artillery. The Russian army appears to have recovered from some of the mistakes it made during the first 12 months of the invasion, and is proving to be surprisingly innovative and effective in defence. Lots of anti-tank mines are being used, for example. Western-supplied mine-clearing vehicles can usually withstand one hit from these mines, but not two. So the Russians are reportedly laying one on top of the other to double the effect. The Russians have also started booby-trapping trenches. In a video, verified by the BBC - but which is too graphic to show, you can see Ukrainian infantry entering empty trenches south of Zaporizhzhia, before hidden explosives are detonated, blowing up some of the troops. The Russian military is also taking advantage of its air power - such as using its Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopters. These helicopters can be used to fire rockets at Ukrainian armoured vehicles which have been forced to slow down or stop after encountering a minefield. And Ukraine - it's worth noting - does not have air superiority over the battlefield. While Russia was building its defences, Ukraine was putting together a dozen, newly-formed armoured brigades, many of them trained in Europe and supplied with better equipment than the Russians. Ukraine now has the capability to launch missiles, rockets or shells deep behind Russian lines - hitting their fuel depots, ammunition hubs and command and control centres, which could weaken Russia's defences from within. This British-supplied Storm Shadow missile, for example, has a range of more than 150 miles (240km), and has enabled Ukraine to push some of Russia's positions further away from the front line. Ukraine is also using US-supplied cluster munitions. Many don't explode on impact and remain a long-term hazard, but the US says they are proving effective against some entrenched Russian positions. However, Gian Luca Capovin, an analyst with Jane's Defence, says cluster weapons can help, but won't be \"a game-changer.\" Russia also has its own cluster weapons, and has also deployed them as we reported last year. Ultimately, time is not on Ukraine's side. By autumn, the rainy season will have arrived, turning unpaved roads into mud and making further advances difficult, if not impossible. By the time that ends, in the spring, the US presidential election cycle will be under way. If Ukraine cannot show any decisive gains on the battlefield by then, it is far from certain that US and Nato support will continue at their current high levels. For Kyiv, the clock is ticking. Meanwhile Russia simply has to hang on to the territory it has illegally seized. Additional reporting by Benedict Garman, Thomas Spencer, Tural Ahmedzade and Filipa Silverio.

        "title": "Hank the Tank: Fugitive burglar bear captured in California",
        "content": "A massive and notoriously mischievous black bear has been captured after more than a year on the run following a string of break-ins in California. The 500lbs (227kg) bear, known to fans as Hank the Tank, is believed to have broken into 21 homes in the Lake Tahoe area since 2022. Hank - who is actually a female bear registered as 64F - will be moved to a sanctuary in Colorado. Her three cubs may be transferred to a facility in California's Sonoma County. In a statement released on Friday, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) said that biologists had \"safely immobilised\" the bear, who had been linked to 21 break-ins by DNA evidence. Pending a successful health check, Hank will be taken to the Wild Animal Sanctuary near Springfield, Colorado. While California authorities have noted that relocation is \"not typically an option\", Hank's fame has given her a reprieve. \"Given the widespread interest in this bear, and the significant risk of a serious incident involving the bear, CDFW is employing an alternative solution to safeguard the bear family as well as the people in the South Lake Tahoe community,\" the statement said. Hank's three cubs will be taken to a different facility in Petaluma, California \"in hopes they can discontinue the negative behaviours they learned from the sow and can be returned to the wild\". On the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, Colorado Governor Jared Polis welcomed Hank - and joked that she should have been named \"Henrietta the Tank\". Hank was originally believed to have been responsible for over 40 break-ins, but DNA samples proved that the break-ins were also the work of at least two other large bears with a voracious appetite for human food. The discovery that Hank was not alone in the crime spree prompted California officials to reassure the public that \"no bears will be be euthanised, harmed, relocated to some facility or placed in a zoo\". Biologists believe that Hank, who is considerably larger than most black bears, had grown unafraid of humans and had learned to use her strength to force her way into people's homes. \"When you have a bear forcibly crashing its way through a garage door or ripping open a front door with people inside, that's pretty brazen and unusual,\" CDFW spokesperson Peter Tira told the BBC in February 2022. The whereabouts and potential fate of the other two bears involved in the spree of California break-ins is unclear. The BBC has reached out to CDFW for comment.",

        "title": "William Friedkin: Director of The Exorcist and The French Connection dies aged 87",
        "content": "William Friedkin, director of the classic horror film The Exorcist, died on Monday at the age of 87. His widow Sherry Lansing told the BBC through tears: \"He had a wonderful life. He was almost 88 - he has a new movie coming out. \"He was the most wonderful husband in the world. He was the most wonderful father in the world. He had a big wonderful, life. There was no dream unfulfilled.\" Friedkin died in Los Angeles on Monday. No cause of death has yet been confirmed. The director was said to have suffered health issues in recent years. His other famous films included crime thriller The French Connection, which won five Academy Awards including best director. Tributes from celebrities and fans began pouring in over social media. On X, formerly known as Twitter, actor Elijah Wood wrote: \"Aww man\u2026a true cinematic master whose influence will continue to extend forever. So long, William Friedkin.\" Friedkin died before his latest movie, The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial, could hit screens at the Venice Film Festival beginning on 30 August. Though his career started in the early 1960s, his most notable success came in the following decade with the release of 1971's The French Connection. The film's five Oscars included best picture, and best actor for Gene Hackman. The Exorcist, released in 1973, had audiences horrified and entranced by the story of a 12-year-old girl possessed by the devil. News media at the time reported cinemagoers fainting and vomiting in their seats, and people leaving the theatre shaking and screaming. The film is reported to have grossed $500m (\u00a3391m) worldwide. It was nominated for 10 Oscars, winning two, and spawned multiple sequels. The latest, titled The Exorcist: The Believer, is scheduled for release in October this year. It was directed by David Gordon Green, who helmed the most recent three films in the Halloween franchise. Friedkin, for his part, was historically not a fan of remakes of the film. At one point he said: \"All of them are ridiculous... what I've seen of them, they want to make me vomit as the little girl vomits in the movie.\" When told by the interviewer that his version of The Exorcist was the best, Friedkin replied: \"By far the best? The others don't even exist.\" Friedkin suffered a decline in form just a few years after The Exorcist, his biggest box office success. Sorcerer, released in 1977, had an estimated budget of $22m but drew barely $6m in box office sales. US media called it a \"flop\". Still, his wider filmmaking legacy remains cherished by critics and audiences alike. Simpsons producer Mike Reiss remembered how the show made \"a parody of his film Sorcerer\", and that Friedkin \"charmed everyone, and even wound up as a guest star\". The director is survived by his widow, Ms Lansing - a former studio chief at Paramount Pictures who was his fourth wife - and two sons. \"The family is obviously very upset,\" Stephen Galloway, a friend of Friedkin's and the dean of Dodge College of Film and Media Arts, told the BBC. \"He literally just finished making a new movie.\" \"His mind was just so sharp, always. And mixed with a kind of wicked mischievous humour. The films that he made in the 70s, they still stand out.\"",

        "title": "Man charged after woman held captive in Oregon cell allegedly threatened to kill the mother of his 2 children",
        "content": "A man who officials say kidnapped and held a woman captive in a makeshift cell in his Oregon garage allegedly attacked, abused and threatened to kill another woman and their two children before she sought a protective order against him three years ago. \u201cHe physically attacks me, he hits me, he brakes (sic) and throws things, he screams at the kids and me ... we get woken up every night from him being drunk and loud and scares us,\u201d the woman wrote in a 2020 petition for a domestic violence restraining order. Negasi Zuberi \u2014 a 29-year-old who goes by the aliases \u201cSakima,\u201d \u201cJustin Hyche\u201d and \u201cJustin Kouassi\u201d \u2014 was arrested July 16 in Nevada in the kidnapping case and has been linked to at least four violent sexual assaults in four states, the FBI said. Officials fear he may have other victims. The woman's petition seeking a restraining order against Justin Kouassi, one of the suspect\u2019s known aliases, was filed in July 2020 in Contra Costa County, California, and obtained by NBC News on Thursday. It's unclear whether the restraining order was issued or if the case was dropped. The document states that a September 2020 appearance dropped from the court calendar. She also accused Zuberi of taking her phone to keep her from calling police and taking her money as a form of financial abuse. She also wrote that she had bruises from him \u201chitting,\u201d \u201crestraining\u201d and \u201cbeating\u201d her. \u201cHe comes at night without my permission, broke my windows, trying to beat on me, treatening (sic) to kill me and my kids,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe treat (sic) to take them away so I can be miserable without them.\u201d NBC News is not identifying the woman or her children, who may be victims of abuse. A phone number listed for the woman was not in service when NBC News attempted to reach her Thursday. The petition also states that the woman\u2019s two children, who she shared with Zuberi, are scared of him. \u201cMy kids hide from him because he\u2019s always loud and angry and unpredictable,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWakes them up all hours of the night making them cry all time.\u201d A neighbor of Zuberi\u2019s in Klamath Fallas, Melanie McClure, said Thursday that she rarely saw his wife or children \u2014 both of whom are younger than 10 \u2014 after the family moved into the home earlier this year. She later befriended Zuberi\u2019s wife and recalled inviting her on a \u201cmom\u2019s night out\u201d with other friends in April or May. When McClure stopped by their home to let the woman know they were leaving, McClure said the woman asked her husband if she could \u201cat least\u201d bring her cellphone.  McClure, stunned at the question, said she tried to reassure Zuberi about their plans. He responded with what McClure described as \u201cdegrading\u201d comments about his wife. \u201cHe told me, \u2018She can go, that\u2019s fine,\u2019\u201d McClure recalled. \u201cBut then this door\u2019s gonna be locked, and she\u2019ll need to figure out where she\u2019s gonna stay tonight.\u201d McClure said she pushed back and Zuberi relented, agreeing to give his wife her phone and to leave the door unlocked. But when the women were at a restaurant, Zuberi showed up, sat at the bar and watched his wife without saying anything for roughly 30 minutes, McClure said. \u201cHe controlled her and her life,\u201d McClure said, adding that she pushed Zuberi\u2019s wife to seek help. While McClure thought police officers would likely be summoned to a situation at the home involving Zuberi and his wife, she never believed they would respond to something as dire as what federal authorities described. \u201cTo think you could get away with something that crazy \u2014 it\u2019s baffling,\u201d she said. Zuberi is accused of kidnapping a sex worker in Seattle last month and taking her to his residence in Klamath Falls, Oregon, where she was kept in a makeshift cell he constructed in his garage of cinderblocks with a metal door that couldn\u2019t be opened from the inside. He's been charged with one count of interstate kidnapping in federal district court in Oregon. According to a criminal complaint, the victim fought her way out and \u201crepeatedly banged on the door\u201d until it broke open. Once out, she flagged down a passing motorist who called 911.  Zuberi fled and was ultimately found in Reno, Nevada, on July 16, with his family at a Walmart parking lot. He was in a car, holding one of his children in the front seat, speaking with his wife who was outside the car, officials said. \u201cHe refused to exit the vehicle and cut himself with a sharp object causing him to bleed profusely. He also attempted to destroy his phone,\u201d the complaint said. The child was unharmed, the document said. The booking report in Washoe County, Nevada, shows additional charges of false imprisonment, child neglect, false imprisonment with victim as a shield, fugitive from another state, and assault with a deadly weapon. Zuberi's lawyer in Oregon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He declined an earlier request. He has lived in 12 states \u2014 California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Utah, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Alabama and Nevada \u2014 over the last decade, the FBI said. Officials said that he may have used several methods to target victims, including drugging drinks and impersonating a police officer. The FBI launched an investigation website where potential victims or others with information related to the case can fill out a form to offer more information. \u201cSome of the encounters may have been filmed to make it appear as if the assault was consensual,\u201d the page noted. \u201cThe victims are threatened with retaliation if they notify the police.\u201d",

Troy Driver, 43, was awaiting trial for Irion's death at the Lyon County Jail in Nevada when he died. He was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and kidnapping in connection with Irion's March 12 disappearance. Deputies at the the Lyon County Jail were conducting a routine check and inmate headcount at around 6:17 p.m. when they found Driver to be unresponsive, according to a news release from the sheriff's office. The deputies administered lifesaving measures to Driver, including CPR, and an ambulance was dispatched to the jail. Driver was pronounced dead by medical personnel after several rounds of unsuccessful CPR. \"Preliminary details thus far indicate that Driver committed suicide by asphyxiation,\" Sheriff Brad Pope said in the news release. \"Driver was housed in a maximum security jail cell and had no contact with other inmates.\" Nevada State Police are investigating the circumstances that led to Driver's death, according to the sheriff's office. \"I want to express my sincerest condolences to the Irion family,\" Pope said. \"My thoughts and prayers are with you.\" Irion was last seen around 5 a.m. March 12 in the parking lot of a Walmart in Fernley, a city about 30 miles east of Reno. Her brother, Casey Valley, 32, said surveillance video from the store showed a man in a mask and hoodie walk to the parking lot from the direction of a dirt lot. The man then circled Irion\u2019s car before forcing his way in. \u201cHe circled around the parking lot maybe to make sure there were no witnesses,\u201d Valley said. \u201cHe came up behind the car and forced his way into the driver\u2019s side of the car. Maybe her door was unlocked. He either said or did something to make her move to the passenger seat, and then he drove her car away into an unknown direction.\u201d Irion\u2019s car was later found in an industrial area in Fernley. On March 30, her body was discovered in a remote gravesite in an area east of Reno, authorities said.",

        "title": "Judge tosses Trump's counterclaim against E. Jean Carroll, finding rape claim 'substantially true'",
        "content": "A federal judge in New York on Monday dismissed Donald Trump's countersuit against E. Jean Carroll, the writer who won a $5 million verdict against the former president for battery and defamation earlier this year. Trump filed his counterclaims against Carroll in June, alleging she defamed him by continuing to say publicly that he'd raped her even after a jury found him not liable for doing so. But, U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan noted Monday, the jury did find Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll during an encounter in the dressing room of a New York City department store in the mid-1990s, and the details of that finding show that her having maintained that the former president raped her is \"substantially true.\" Kaplan dismissed Trump's counterclaim, which sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, as well as several of Trump's defenses against a separate still-pending defamation lawsuit brought by Carroll. \"We strongly disagree with the flawed decision and will be filing an appeal shortly,\u201d Trump attorney Alina Habba said. Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan said she was \"pleased\" with the ruling, which means that the impending Jan. 15 trial in the case \"will be limited to a narrow set of issues and shouldn\u2019t take very long to complete.\" Trump has denied wrongdoing in the case and is appealing the $5 million verdict, but did not testify at trial. Carroll's battery claim against Trump alleged that he'd raped her and sexually abused her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store near Trump Tower in Manhattan. Asked on its verdict sheet whether Carroll had proven \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that \u201cMr. Trump raped Ms. Carroll,\u201d the nine-person jury checked the box that said \u201cno.\u201d Asked whether Carroll had proven \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that \u201cMr. Trump sexually abused Ms. Carroll,\u201d the jury checked the box that said \u201cyes.\u201d Trump's defamation claim centered on an interview Carroll had with CNN the day after the verdict, where she was asked her reaction to the jury's finding that she had not been raped. \"Well, I just immediately say in my own head, 'Oh, yes, he did. Oh, yes, he did.'\" In his ruling, the judge noted the definition of rape he'd given the jury in the case was \"the narrow, technical meaning of that term\" under New York law, which defines rape as forcible penetration with the penis. The judge said the sexual abuse finding shows the jury believed Trump forcibly penetrated Carroll with his fingers. The verdict \"establishes, as against Mr. Trump, the fact that Mr. Trump 'raped' her, albeit digitally rather than with his penis. Thus, it establishes against him the substantial truth of Ms. Carroll's 'rape' allegations,\" Kaplan wrote. The judge also denied Trump's claim of presidential immunity in Carroll's pending defamation case, finding he'd waited too long to raise that defense. Kaplan also shot down Trump's argument that Carroll should not be entitled to punitive damages in the case. The current case was filed before the case that resulted in the May verdict against Trump. The original case, which the judge refers to as \"Carroll I,\" alleges then-President Trump defamed Carroll after she came forward with her rape claim in 2019. While that case was tied up on appeal, Carroll filed a second suit over the decades-old rape allegation that included a defamation claim for post-presidency comments Trump had made about her. Carroll was able to file the battery claim after New York passed a law that opened a one-year window for adult victims of sexual offenses to file civil suits, even if the statute of limitations on their claims had expired, as it had for Carroll. While Trump did not take the witness stand in \"Carroll II,\" he did sit for a deposition in the case last year, and excerpts of his sworn testimony were shown to the jury. Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's office, where Trump has been charged with falsifying business records relating to hush money payments, issued a subpoena to review the entire deposition, which Kaplan signed off on in a ruling last week, court records show. Trump has pleaded not guilty in the New York case, and his lawyers have accused the DA's office of engaging in a fishing expedition with the subpoena.",

        "title": "How U.S. microchips are fueling Russia\u2019s military \u2014 despite sanctions",
        "content": "Western microchips used to power smartphones and laptops are continuing to enter Russia and fuel its military arsenal, new analysis shows. Trade data and manifests analyzed by CNBC show that Moscow has been sourcing an increased number of semiconductors and other advanced Western technologies through intermediary countries such as China. In 2022, Russia imported $2.5 billion worth of semiconductor technologies, up from $1.8 billion in 2021. Semiconductors and microchips play a crucial role in modern-day warfare, powering a range of equipment including drones, radios, missiles, and armored vehicles. Indeed, the KSE Institute \u2014 an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics \u2014 recently analyzed 58 pieces of critical Russian military equipment recovered from Ukraine\u2019s battlefield and found more than 1,000 foreign components, primarily Western semiconductor technologies. Many of these components are subject to export controls. But, according to analysts CNBC spoke to, convoluted trade routes via China, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere mean they are still entering Russia, adding to the country\u2019s pre-war stockpiles. \u201cRussia is still being able to import all the necessary Western-produced critical components for its military,\u201d said Elina Ribakova, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and one of the authors of KSE Institute\u2019s report. \u201cThe sanctions evasion and avoidance is surprisingly brazen at the moment,\u201d she added. Not all advanced technologies are subject to Western sanctions on Russia. Many are dubbed dual-use items, meaning they have both civilian and military applications, and therefore fall outside of the scope of targeted export controls. A microchip may have applications in both a washing machine and a drone, for instance. Still, many of these products originate from Western nations with sweeping trade bans against Moscow and, specifically, its military. All U.S.-origin items except food and medicine are prohibited from reaching Russia\u2019s army. In KSE\u2019s study, more than two-thirds of the foreign components identified in Russian military equipment ultimately originated from companies headquartered in the U.S., with others coming from Ukrainian allies including Japan and Germany. CNBC was unable to verify whether the implicated companies were aware of the final destination of their goods. Swiss authorities said they were working with firms to \u201ceducate them on red flags,\u201d while government spokespeople for the other countries cited did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Separately, a study from the Royal United Services Institute found that Russia\u2019s military uses over 450 different types of foreign-made components in its 27 most modern military systems, including cruise missiles, communications systems and electronic warfare complexes. Many of these parts are made by well-known U.S. companies that create microelectronics for the U.S. military. \u201cOver decades, non-Russian high-tech systems and technologies became more advanced and really have become industry and global standards. So, a Russian military, as well as its civilian economy, have become dependent,\u201d Sam Bendett, advisor at the Center for Naval Analyses, said. The ubiquity and wide-reaching applications of such technologies have led them to become intertwined in global supply chains and therefore harder to police. Meanwhile, sanctions on Russia are largely limited to Ukraine\u2019s Western allies, meaning that many countries continue to trade with Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to stop strictly civilian microelectronics from crossing borders and from taking place in global trade. And this is what the Russian industry as well as the Russian military and its intelligence services are taking advantage of,\u201d Bendett said. Those trade flows can be messy. Typically, a shipment may be sold and resold several times, often through legitimate businesses, before eventually reaching a neutral intermediary country, where it can then be sold to Russia. Data suggests China is by far the largest exporter to Russia of microchips and other technology found in crucial battlefield items. Sellers from China, including Hong Kong, accounted for more than 87% of total Russian semiconductor imports in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with 33% in Q4 2021. More than half (55%) of those goods were not manufactured in China, but instead produced elsewhere and shipped to Russia via China and Hong Kong-based intermediaries. \u201cThis should not be taken as a surprise because China is really trying to accumulate and to make profits and gains on the fact that Russia is economically isolated,\u201d Olena Yurchenko, advisor at the Economic Security Council of Ukraine, said. China\u2019s trade department did not respond to a request for comment on the findings, nor did the Russian government. Meantime, Moscow has also increased its imports from so-called intermediary countries in the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East, according to national trade data. Exports to Russia from Georgia, Armenia and Kyrgystan, for instance, surged in 2022, with vehicles, aircraft and vessels accounting for a significant share of the uptick. At the same time, European Union and U.K. exports to those countries rose, while their direct trade with Russia plunged. \u201cA lot of these countries really cannot sever certain types of trade with Russia, especially those nations which are either bordering Russia, like Georgia, for example ... as well as nations in Central Asia, which maintain a very significant trade balance with the Russian Federation,\u201d Bendett said. The governments of Georgia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan did not respond to CNBC\u2019s request for comment on the increase in trade. The burgeoning trade flows have prompted calls from Western allies to either get more countries on board with sanctions, or slap secondary sanctions on certain entities operating within those countries in a bid to stifle Russia\u2019s military strength.  In June 2023, the European Union adopted a new package of sanctions which includes an anti-circumvention tool to restrict the \u201csale, supply, transfer or export\u201d of specified sanctioned goods and technology to certain third countries acting as intermediaries for Russia. The package also added 87 new companies in countries spanning China, the United Arab Emirates and Armenia to the list of those directly supporting Russia\u2019s military, and restricted the export of 15 technological items found in Russian military equipment in Ukraine. \u201cWe are not sanctioning these countries themselves. What we are doing is preventing an already sanctioned product, which should not reach Russia, from reaching Russia through a third country,\u201d EU spokesperson Daniel Ferrie said.  However, some are skeptical that the measures go far enough \u2014 particularly when it comes to major global trade partners.  \u2033[The sanctions] may work against, let\u2019s say, Armenia or Georgia, which are not big trade partners for European Union or for the United States. But in when it comes, for instance, to China or to Turkey, that\u2019s a very unlikely scenario,\u201d the Economic Security Council of Ukraine\u2019s Yurchenko said. Others say that responsibility ultimately lies with the companies, which need to do more to monitor their supply chains and avoid their goods falling into the wrong hands. \u201cThe companies themselves should have the infrastructure to be able to track it and comply with export controls,\u201d Ribakova said. \u201cIf we have certain moral values or national security objectives, we cannot be giving [to Ukraine] with one hand and then giving to Russia with the other.\u201d",

        "title": "A Former Oil Guy Is Using Fracking Tech to Boost Geothermal",
        "content": "Of all the technological progress of the past few decades, there is a good argument to be made that a series of fossil fuel industry innovations that helped spark the U.S. shale oil boom have had the single largest effect on the course of global geopolitics, and the world\u2019s biosphere. Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking shifted the U.S. from being a net fuel importer to exporter\u2014a realignment of the world\u2019s strategic chessboard currently being demonstrated in the fleets of American oil and natural gas tankers helping circumvent Russia\u2019s energy blockade of Europe. At the same time, all that new, cheap fuel helped prolong the U.S.\u2019s carbon addiction for years, with incipient renewables unable to compete against natural gas. But that drilling technology may yet have a climate upside. Last month, Houston-based startup Fervo announced the successful test of a first-of-its kind commercial-scale power plant, which uses the shale oil drilling innovations to produce zero-emission geothermal energy. While horizontal drilling allows oil producers to access new seams of fossil fuels, in Fervo\u2019s case, the company is drilling sideways into hot, porous rocks heated by tectonic activity. The company then pumps water through those rocks in order to generate steam and produce electricity. Right now, its project in northern Nevada is capable of producing about 3.5 megawatts of energy, or enough electricity to power about 2,600 homes. Once the plant gets hooked up to the grid later this year, that electricity will be used to power Google data centers and other Alphabet operations. Unlike solar and wind energy, which only generate energy when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, geothermal plants can provide a constant stream of power, which is crucial to balancing the grid. Currently, geothermal energy accounts for about 0.4% of U.S. electricity. But, like in the U.S. fracking boom, Fervo\u2019s technology could make it feasible to develop geothermal power plants in many more areas where it wouldn\u2019t have made financial sense before, a change that could help raise geothermal energy as a serious player in decarbonizing the U.S. grid. Tim Latimer started his career in the oil and gas industry, before co-founding Fervo in 2017. He spoke with TIME about finding a way to use oil industry technology for the planet, and his vision for the future of geothermal energy.  The following conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. TIME: Can you tell us about how Fervo\u2019s technology works? Why is it important? Tim Latimer: Geothermal power generation has been around for over 100 years. The first geothermal power plant was built in Italy around the turn of the last century. All geothermal [power] kind of works the same way: you drill to high temperature geology, and then you produce hot water or steam out of wells that you drill into, and then capture that at the surface to create electricity. There's been plants built all over the world. It's a huge part of the electricity mix in places like Iceland, New Zealand, and Kenya. But traditionally, the struggle has been that you [have to] tap really hot, shallow, productive, natural basins to be cost-effective. But those sites got tapped [decades] ago, and we had to drill deeper to less hot places and less productive wells, and technology really didn't keep up. So the reason geothermal hadn't expanded was that once you cherry pick these geologic hotspots and try to move on to other places, the tech didn't exist to make it cost effective. Traditionally, you would drill simple vertical wells, and you would flow [water] between injection wells and production wells. What's novel about our site is we drilled down about 8,000 ft., and then we turned and drilled horizontally for 4,000 ft. And then we flowed [water] from one horizontal well to the other across several hundred feet in that high temperature rock 8,000 ft. beneath our feet. That solves some of these economic challenges and allows us to go to deeper places and still make the economics work.  What was the biggest challenge of making that oil and gas technology work for geothermal power? Our geology requirements are quite a bit different. In the U.S., there's been well over 100,000 horizontal oil and gas wells drilled, but generally, those are in shallower places where the rock is softer, and it's not as hot. So it has taken a lot of work to be able to adapt the equipment. Our wells are much higher temperature\u2014the project that we did here was nearly 400\u2109. We're also drilling through granite, and so that's much harder rock.  What sort of new technology did you need to drill through harder rock and higher heat? Some of it is better tools, like drill bits with harder surfaces, and motors and electronics that are built to deal with higher temperatures. And some of it is just better techniques. One of the things that we drove forward was a way of pumping fluid down while we're drilling that cools your drilling system more efficiently than in an oil and gas operation. Where are these hot rocks that you need? How much more geothermal energy could your technology open up? Our current projects are in states like Utah and Nevada that have good natural geology for geothermal, where we can still drill relatively shallow wells and get to high temperature [rock]. But we're not limited to those geologies. We're just starting there first because it's the low-hanging fruit. Principally, there's virtually an unlimited amount of geothermal energy. The world is really big, and the world is really hot. We've got billions of years of energy under our feet. It's all a question about how much you can access economically. We think with existing technology, drilling down to about 4,000 meters [over 13,100 ft.] is probably cost effective. Read more: How Amazon Became the Largest Buyer of Renewable Energy in the World As part of the [U.S.] Energy Secretary's enhanced geothermal Earthshot that she announced last year, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory did a study looking in detail at the Western United States, and determining how much high temperature rock can you find at 4,000 meters [over 13,100 ft.] or shallower, and found over 200 gigawatts of [potential power] that was just in that shallow depth. That would represent as much as 20% of U.S. electricity supply, if we can develop that amount. But what we think is, as we expand this technology, we won't have to be just limited to the western United States. We can get so cost effective that we can come to the Eastern United States where we would have to drill deeper, but still make it cost effective. And so there's really no practical limit to how much geothermal [energy] there can be. It's just a question of how quickly we can get more efficient at drilling and repeat the results that we did in our pilot, and just continue to bring costs down every time we build a new power plant. Was there a particular day where you got out of bed, and said, \u201cI'm done with oil and gas, and I\u2019m going to use this drilling technology for renewables instead?\u201d  I've always been really passionate about the environment. I love the outdoors. And so even when I started my career in oil and gas, it was something I was thinking about a lot. I'm from Houston. The oil and gas industry has been a big part of my life and my community. But the more I got passionate about climate change, the more I really wanted to start looking at new solutions. There's two things that happened for me that were important. I realized that a lot of my friends, a lot of my family, and a huge part of our city all had our employment prospects tied up in the oil and gas industry. And I started realizing this energy transition is real, and if we're going to take serious action on climate, we need to make sure that there's something that Houston is doing. And not just Houston, but other major oil and gas places around the world. People in places where oil and gas is the primary economic driver need to find a way to transition. And so I wanted to figure out how somebody from the oil and gas industry could apply their skills to climate change. When I discovered geothermal, I felt really excited. This is a field that needs drilling engineers, but to produce a carbon-free energy source. And then another thing for me was I lived in Houston during this series of floods we got in the 2010s. Year after year, we got these one-in-1,000 year events. Everybody knows about Hurricane Harvey in 2017. But for me, in 2015, there was a flood and they canceled my work. And I walked outside my apartment, and the road outside had 20 ft. of water on it. Everything was underwater. It was this moment where [climate change] went from being this thing that I was intellectually curious and about to being like, \u201cThis is not normal. This is a pretty urgent crisis.\u201d I ended up quitting my job just a couple of months after that to go to graduate school, and ended up pursuing this new geothermal path. I wrote in my application essay to Stanford Business School that my goal was to learn the entrepreneurial skills to launch a geothermal company that can take technology from the oil and gas industry to disrupt the geothermal sector. So it was a pretty calculated move. I imagine that a lot of people you're working with also come from an oil and gas background, and maybe decided to leave because that industry is not really going to be viable anymore for us as a species. Does that play into recruiting folks? Totally. 60% of the employees at Fervo come from a background in the oil and gas industry. Growing up here [in Houston], oil and gas is just a massive employer. I really get frustrated when people demonize the people that work in oil and gas. They are some of the best people. It's an incredibly diverse group with people from all over, and a lot of them are also passionate about climate change. We\u2019re able to tap into that growing part of that workforce that is thinking deeply about climate change. If we want to deploy geothermal energy as quickly as we need to to actually have an impact on global carbon emissions, we need to recruit tens of thousands of people to come work with us. And so recruiting from the oil and gas industry is a major part of our strategy. What does the future look like for Fervo?  We're going into full deployment mode. Technologies like this only make a difference if we deploy them at large-scale in a way that can reduce carbon emissions and increase the reliability of the grid. Our next project that we're breaking ground on is going to be nearly 100 times bigger than our pilot. We're targeting a 400 megawatt project [in Utah] that we're going to be constructing over the next four years. And then beyond that, it's our ambition to unlock that full multi-hundred gigawatt resource that the National Renewable Energy Lab has identified. The goal here is to be 20% of U.S. electricity supply by 2050, and then to repeat that around the world.",

        "title": "Carbon credits - land grab or the Amazon\u2019s future?",
        "content": "This week, delegates arriving in Bel\u00e9m's international airport are being welcomed with a lively \"Boi de mascara\" folkloric dance routine. In fact, the whole city is celebrating being in the spotlight, playing host to the Amazon Summit. It also feels like a bit of a warm-up for 2025 when the city hosts COP30. These two events are a big deal for this part of Brazil - a region that often feels forgotten. Bel\u00e9m's well-placed too, as the capital of Par\u00e1, the most deforested state in all of Brazil. President Lula da Silva called this summit to bring together the eight South American countries who share a slice of the Amazon. It's the first time in 45 years that there's been a meeting like this, ensuring a regional response to combat crime and deforestation as well as climate change. \"I think the world needs to look at this meeting in Bel\u00e9m as a milestone,\" Lula told the BBC last week. \"I've participated in several meetings and many times they talk, talk, talk, approve a document and nothing happens. This meeting is the first great opportunity for people to show the world what we want to do.\" President Lula da Silva has promised to reverse rising deforestation seen under his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro. In July this year, deforestation fell 66% compared with 2022 and Lula's committed to zero deforestation by 2030. \"You have no idea how much pressure there was in our community from the Bolsonaro government,\" says Robson Gon\u00e7alves Machado, who lives on the banks of the River Acangat\u00e1. \"Landowners circling in planes, soya farmers wanting to buy the land to deforest it.\" Robson lives on the banks of one of hundreds of waterways that wind their way through Ilha do Maraj\u00f3. It's the world's largest river island and sits on the northern coast of Brazil near Bel\u00e9m - the easternmost part of the Amazon. The only way to get to Robson's community is by boat - 13 hours overnight from Bel\u00e9m. It may feel isolated, but he's definitely aware of the demand there is for their land from outsiders. While Par\u00e1 is well-known as the epicentre of Brazil's deforestation, more recently it's also become an appealing prospect for another burgeoning forest industry - carbon credits. The way it works is this: an organisation that pollutes can buy a credit which is worth one tonne of carbon dioxide - so for every tonne of CO2 emitted, the credit represents a tonne of CO2 that was captured. Those credits are bought and sold and their prices are determined like any other market. With the World Bank estimating the carbon credit market in the forest is worth $210bn (\u00a3165bn) a year, there's huge potential. While the summit is a diplomatic event, the run-up to the meeting included several days of discussions on issues including the carbon market. Robson's community of Acangat\u00e1 recently signed a statement of intent with one of the carbon credit companies working in the area. It's not kicked off in earnest, but they have to undertake courses that include sustainable forestry management, chicken rearing and biogas projects. \"At the beginning there were lots of doubts,\" says Robson. \"In the municipality there was a huge land grab worth millions of reais of carbon that was sold and that didn't get passed down to the community.\" Carbon credit companies operating in Ilha do Maraj\u00f3 have been accused of harassing people into contracts, pressuring people to be a part of their projects, without actually giving them much detail. Par\u00e1's public prosecutor has since got involved to halt projects that have caused concern. The market still remains unregulated although Lula has promised to address this. Teacher Bianca Teles and her family make their living from cassava flour in a community two hours boat ride from Robson. The $200 they earn a week isn't enough. When a carbon credit company offered to help build a school and health centre, even that wasn't enough to convince her. \"It's not that transparent,\" she said. \"We can't see how it would give us a secure life. We're always on the back foot, fearing the consequences. Because of these stories we heard, we decided not to sign a contract.\" Many of the problems arise because the state is so absent in the Amazon - public services are weak, people feel abandoned. And that's when companies often come in to fill that gap - for good and bad. \"When the state isn't there, it creates a no man's land where anything can happen,\" says prosecutor Eliane Moreira. On the other side of Ilha do Maraj\u00f3, Hernandez Pantoja proudly shows off his a\u00e7ai and cacao plantation. The machinery and training were provided for by Carbonext, a Brazilian carbon credit company that has received investment funding from Shell. The community will also get a share of the credits. \"Just last year we chucked out five illegal sawmills from our land,\" he says. The community knows that defending their territory from illegal logging is a challenge on their own. But partnering with a company with the funds behind it, and a plan to ensure sustainable forestry, is the only way forward. \"We want support to look after our forest - we don't want to cut down trees anymore.\" For Carbonext, empowering the communities to look after their land is important. So too is empowering the region as a whole. \"When the global north comes to the global south and says, 'I have the solution,' we're like, 'Really? Have you been to the Amazon?'\" says CEO Jana\u00edna Dallan. \"How can you solve that problem if you've never been there? You don't have your boots on the ground. So it's very easy to say, 'I have the solution.'\" People on the ground in the Amazon - and those at the summit this week - are determined to make South America's voice heard when it comes to climate change.",

        "title": "Nigeria's President Tinubu faces backlash over military intervention in Niger",
        "content": "Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu is facing a huge backlash at home over his threat to use military force to reverse the coup in next-door neighbour Niger. Local media report there was strong opposition to military intervention at a session of the upper chamber of parliament, the Senate, on Saturday, despite the fact that it is controlled by Mr Tinubu's party. This was especially the case among lawmakers representing states along the more than 1,500km (930 mile)-long border with Niger, but there has also been countrywide condemnation of the possibility of war. West African regional bloc Ecowas had set a deadline of Sunday for the junta to give up power - or face possible military action. The decision was very much seen as Mr Tinubu's as he is Ecowas' current chairman, and Nigeria is its most influential member. Although the junta has defied the ultimatum, Ecowas did not respond by immediately sending troops. This came as a relief to many Nigerians who prefer a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. Some question whether a seven-day deadline was realistic given that Nigeria and other countries have to get parliamentary approval before deploying the military. Many people are also appalled that electricity to Niger was cut on President Tinubu's orders, causing blackouts in Niger's capital, Niamey, and other cities. Critics claim that this is in violation of a treaty that had enabled Nigeria to build a dam on the River Niger, though Mr Tinubu's supporters say the power cuts are aimed at pressuring the junta to hand back power to ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, without military confrontation. Nigeria and Niger share strong ethnic, economic and cultural ties and any military intervention against Niger would affect northern Nigeria, already facing serious security challenges of its own. An influential group of Muslim clerics in northern Nigeria said Mr Tinubu must not \"rush into an avoidable conflict with a neighbour at the behest of global politicking\". Mr Bazoum was a key ally of the West, allowing former colonial power France and the US to keep military bases in the country to help in the fight against militant Islamists wreaking havoc across much of West Africa. The military juntas in Mali and Burkina Faso have vowed to come to the defence of Niger's coup leaders if Ecowas does use force, raising the prospect of a major regional conflict. All eyes are now on Mr Tinubu who has been the most vocal in condemning coups in West Africa, and said last month that Ecowas cannot be made up of \"toothless bulldogs\". \"We must stand firm on democracy. There is no governance, freedom and rule of law without democracy. We will not accept coup after coup in West Africa again,\" Mr Tinubu said, shortly after taking the leadership of the regional body. Nigeria's constitution states that the president cannot deploy troops without the approval of the National Assembly - made up of both the upper and lower chambers of parliament. It is unclear whether Mr Tinubu will get its support, given the opposition he is facing. \"Ecowas goofed, the Nigerian president also goofed,\" said Prof Khalifa Dikwa, an academic at the University of Maiduguri and a member of an influential group of elders in northern Nigeria. In a cautious statement after Saturday's closed-door session, Senate leader Godswill Akpabio threw the ball into the court of the Ecowas parliament, saying it should provide \"solutions to resolve this logjam as soon as possible\". President Tinubu's tough line against coups might be rooted in his own experience. He was barely a year in office as a lawmaker in the early 1990s before elections were annulled, parliament was dissolved and Gen Sani Abacha seized power. He joined the pro-democracy movement that campaigned for a return to civilian rule, putting him in the crosshairs of the military that forced him into exile. He returned in 1998 after the death of Gen Abacha, one of Nigeria's most brutal and corrupt military rulers. But there is a feeling among many Nigerians that Ecowas was too hasty in issuing an ultimatum to the junta, and President Tinubu had not given enough thought to the domestic implications of using force. \"Niger was a continuation of the northern part of Nigeria until the Berlin Conference [of 1884-1885, when foreign powers created Africa's current borders]. You expect the north to go to war against itself?\" asked Prof Dikwa. Unlike his predecessor Muhammadu Buhari, President Tinubu does not have a military background and neither does his national security adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, who is a former policeman. Ecowas army chiefs issued their own statement last week, saying they saw military intervention very much as a \"last resort\". Critics say Mr Tinubu has a history of rushing to make big decisions, pointing to the fact that he used his first speech as president in May to announce the ending of a decades-long fuel subsidy, in unscripted remarks which led to chaos. Ecowas leaders will now hold a summit in Nigeria's capital Abuja on Thursday to decide on the next line of action. Although some other West African countries have promised to take part in any military intervention, it is hard to see them doing so without Nigeria, if the National Assembly does not give its backing. Mr Tinubu wears two hats - that of Ecowas chairman and Nigeria's president. The one necessitates acting in the regional interest and in defence of democracy, but it could prove very costly to the other hat.",

        "title": "Climate change: The record summer that scorched Asia",
        "content": "Rain or shine, Mohammad Shukkur Ali, a rickshaw puller in his 50s, shows up for work on the streets of the Bangladesh capital Dhaka. The work is already punishing as it requires massive physical effort. But this year, the heat has made things even worse. Temperatures in the city hit 40.6C (105.8F) in April - a record high. But Mr Ali, who lives with his wife and two children in a rented room, says he has no choice but to endure the discomfort. \"I need to work because we are poor,\" he said. Mr Ali works eight-hour shifts every day in Gulshan, an affluent district in Dhaka which houses fancy apartments, sprawling corporate offices and several foreign embassies. To be even allowed into the area, he has to wear a jacket over his shirt - a uniform of sorts - which makes the heat even more uncomfortable. The gruelling heat in the country has been made worse by fuel shortages- a consequence of the Ukraine war - which has led to frequent power cuts. Millions of people across the world, including in North America and Europe, have experienced blistering heat this year. A large number of cities have reported record temperatures, with scientists saying that July is \"virtually certain\" to be the world's warmest month on record. Countries have pledged to keep the world from warming past 1.5C - a limit seen as a key threshold to prevent the worst of the impacts of climate change by reducing fossil fuel emissions. But scientists say there is a high chance that this limit will be breached in the next four years. The globe is now about 1.1C warmer than pre-industrial times. But alarmingly, that increase has been even higher in Asia this year. A recent report, compiled by nearly two dozen climate scientists, found that temperatures earlier this year were up by 2C in many parts of Asia, a region home to more than 4.5 billion people. And the impact of this year's extreme heat has been felt in countries across the continent. At least 23 people have died from heat-related injuries in South Korea between May and August, more than triple the number from the same period last year. Temperatures had risen to as high as 38C in parts of the country. On Thursday, Hundreds of participants at the 25th World Scout Jamboree in Buan, were hit by heat exhaustion. Other parts of the country witnessed heavy rainfalls and floods. Japan issued heatstroke alerts across half of the country in mid-July after temperatures broke records in many parts of the country. The country's capital Tokyo alone saw temperatures reach a record-high of 38C (100.4F), 8C higher that an average Tokyo summer. And in just one week in July, local media reported that more than 9,000 people were hospitalised due to heatstroke across the country. China recorded its hottest temperature, when the mercury in a dusty western Xinjiang province town surged to 52C (125F) in July. Just a month earlier, the capital Beijing recorded its hottest June day in more than 60 years at 51C (123.8F). In India, an intense heatwave swept through the north of the country in May, with temperatures climbing to a record 49.2C (120.5F) in parts of the capital, Delhi. South East Asia also saw record temperatures in a number of countries in both April and May - which are typically the hottest months for the region. Heatwaves are among the deadliest natural disasters in the world, sometimes killing more people than earthquakes, typhoons, or floods. They can also melt roads, destroy infrastructure, and start forest fires. Some experts call heatwaves a silent disaster because the deaths are often not immediately obvious - they can also trigger pre-existing conditions like diabetes, which are exacerbated in the heat and increase chances of dehydration. Extreme heat also forces the heart to work harder. Just a half degree rise in core body temperature can raise the heart rate by 10 beats per minute. Heatstroke can occur when the core body temperature rises and stays above 40C (104F), according to Mayo Clinic. It can lead to organ failure, cardiac arrest, and even death if left untreated. Heat increases moisture in the air and \"the sweat on your skin simply can't evaporate [and take the heat away] in the humidity,\" said Winston Chow, an associate professor of Urban Climate at Singapore Management University. \"It becomes dangerous when the body loses the natural ability to cool off.\" A 35C (95F) wet-bulb temperature - what scientists call the measure of heat plus humidity - is the \"absolute limit\" of human tolerance, according to Zach Schlader, a physiologist at Indiana University Bloomington. Senthil Logesh, a 26-year-old Indian construction worker in Singapore, said heat shelters and water points had to be installed on site where he currently works. Temperatures in parts of the city, which is humid throughout the year, had hit 37C (98.6F) in May, matching a record set four decades ago. The wet-bulb temperature was monitored on the site, and workers were asked to rest when it got too high. But even then, Mr Logesh, who works 10 hours almost every day of the week, said that everyone was always \"wet from sweating a lot.\" Over the next decades, population is expected to double in Asia, with the growth mainly in tier-two cities in countries like Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam, according to Prof Chow, who also co-chairs the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN's top climate science agency that assesses the socio-economic impact of climate change. \"Not only will there be more construction taking place, but it will also happen in hotter conditions, so we need to start looking at reducing risks for many vulnerable people,\" he said. While reducing emissions is important to prevent the world from warming further, Prof Chow said that countries also need to adapt to heatwaves, which will only increase in intensity and frequency. In South East Asia's wealthier countries like Singapore for instance, infrastructures exist to shield people from the heat, like air-conditioning in malls and homes. The country also plans to build more green spaces, covered walkways, and change building designs to offer more shelter. However, poorer countries in the same region are unable to implement similar measures. Even when plans to tackle heat exist, they are typically underfunded and often overlook poorer communities. Thailand, for example, has a national-level early warning system for heatwaves, asking people to find shelter or wear light-coloured clothing, according to Chaya Vaddhanaphuti, a co-author of the Asia heatwave report. \"But not everyone can do that, such as homeless people, the disabled, or the elderly. The plans need to be tailored to these groups as well,\" she told the BBC. \"This is all assuming people actually do as they are told. These plans serve more as general recommendations than specific instructions.\" One example of a low budget plan that has seen some success is one developed by the western Indian city of Ahmedabad in 2013, after experiencing a devastating heatwave that killed 1,344 people. Authorities used white paint on the tin and asbestos roofs of the homes of migrant slums to cool them. They make up a quarter of the city's households. Public parks are also kept unlocked throughout the day for street stall owners and construction workers to find shade. Other Indian cities have since tried replicating this plan. But critics say more can be done for the poorest communities who still suffer the brunt of natural disasters like heatwaves as they often don't have the means, or access to infrastructure, to cope. On hot summer nights in Nepal, 30-year-old Krishni Tharu falls asleep in the same room with her two children and mother-in-law, the whole family sharing a single standing fan. In the western city of Nepalgunj, where she works as a construction labourer, temperatures hit 44C (111F) in June. Nepal, home to Mount Everest, gets warm during the main summer period from May to July. Government data also shows that the temperature has been steadily on the rise every year. She's usually exhausted after working 10-hour days, from dawn to dusk, earning about US$4.50 each shift to support her family. Such gruelling, outdoor labour has only gotten harder in recent years as the heat has gotten worse, she said. But she can't stop. Cutting off her family's precious income is not an option, she told the BBC. \"There is no escape. I have to work.\" Additional reporting by BBC World Service reporters Orchi Othondrila in Dhaka and Bimala Chaudhary in Kathmandu.",

        "content": "A woman was in critical condition following a shark attack Monday off Rockaway Beach, one of the New York City's most popular Atlantic coast attractions, authorities said. The attack was reported at 5:49 p.m., in the water at 59th Street, according to the New York Police Department's public information office. She remained in critical condition at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center late Monday night, spokesperson Michael Hinck said. The city's Department of Parks and Recreation said the victim was a 50-year-old swimmer bitten on her left leg. The attack prompted lifeguards to clear the beach as police in a helicopter searched unsuccessfully for the shark, the parks department said in a statement. The beach is subject to a delayed open Tuesday, with a start time of 11 a.m. at the earliest, as authorities will continue to monitor the area for sharks, the parks department said. \"We hope for a full recovery for this swimmer,\" the parks department said. \"Though this was a frightening event, we want to remind New Yorkers that shark bites in Rockaway are extremely rare.\" Multiple shark attacks were reported a month ago northeast of Rockaway, in the waters off Fire Island, off Quogue, a village on Long Island, and off Babylon, New York. Sand tiger sharks, which can grow to 10 feet, have been spotted in relatively large numbers along the surf line off Long Island this summer. Experts at the Florida Museum's International Shark Attack File say they are attracted to the bays and baitfish of the Long Island coast. The file last year said that in 2022 New York state recorded eight of its 20 shark attacks reported since 1837.",

Several city officials told NBC Los Angeles\u2019 I-Team that 8,967 officers were employed as of July 30, far below Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 goal of 9,500 and about 300 below what the current budget allows, roughly 9,300 officers. Since then, another class has graduated from the police academy \u2014 bringing the total number of officers to 8,995 \u2014 though it will be several months before the newest officers complete field training. A new academy class began last week at less than half of capacity. \u201cUnfortunately that academy class will only have 29 recruits,\u201d Chief Michel Moore told the Board of Police Commissioners on July 25. \u201cOur effort is to hire 60 every four weeks.\u201d The police department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the current staffing numbers or how the reduction in available officers was affecting operations. Officers are voting this week on whether to accept a four-year employment contract that promises raises of nearly 20% for most officers and a higher starting salary for recruits. The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union that represents most officers, said last week that it hoped that the pay increases would help draw in more candidates. The police department grew to more than 9,000 officers under Riordan when he and the City Council were united in efforts to try to grow it to at least 10,000 officers. By 2009, the police workforce had expanded to 9,895, when then-Chief Bill Bratton said there were still too few officers for the size and population of the country\u2019s second-largest city.",

        "content": "Actress Sandra Bullock's long-term partner, photographer Bryan Randall, has died at the age of 57. His family confirmed he died after being diagnosed three years ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In a statement, Randall's family said they were \"immensely grateful to the tireless doctors who navigated the landscape of this illness\". Bullock's sister praised the Hollywood actress for the \"amazing\" way she cared for her husband in his final years. \"ALS is a cruel disease but there is some comfort in knowing he had the best of caretakers in my amazing sister and the band of nurses she assembled who helped her look after him in their home,\" Gesine Bullock-Prado wrote on Instagram. \"I'm convinced that Bry has found the best fishing spot in heaven and is already casting his lure into rushing rivers teaming with salmon,\" she added. Randall's death was first announced in a statement his family released to People. The family said the photographer \"chose early to keep his journey with ALS private\", adding: \"Those of us who cared for him did our best to honour his request. \"We are immensely grateful to the tireless doctors who navigated the landscape of this illness with us and to the astounding nurses who became our roommates, often sacrificing their own families to be with ours. \"At this time we ask for privacy to grieve and to come to terms with the impossibility of saying goodbye to Bryan.\" Sandra Bullock is best-known for films such as Speed, Gravity and Miss Congeniality, and won an Oscar in 2010 for her performance in The Blind Side. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease after a famous New York baseball player who died from it, is a progressive disease for which there is no cure. It is caused by the death of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control the movement of muscles that we control consciously. The disease often begins with muscle twitching and weakness in an arm or leg, trouble swallowing or slurred speech, but as it progresses it profoundly impacts on the ability to move, talk and even breathe. Most people die within two years of being diagnosed. The exact cause of the disease is still not known. A small number of cases are inherited. ALS is the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND).",

        "title": "Pakistan: Imran Khan's supporters are silenced but determined",
        "content": "When former prime minister Imran Khan was arrested over the weekend over corruption allegations, there was barely a whimper of protest. Not a single major demonstration was reported anywhere in the country. Compare this to a few months ago, when the 70-year-old was arrested and taken from a court complex in Islamabad on 9 May. It sparked protests around the country, which also led to violence in some places as Mr Khan's supporters clashed with security forces. Some protesters raided military buildings and even ransacked the home of the most senior military commander in Lahore. But this time around, when Mr Khan was sentenced and then taken to a prison in Attock city, authorities were ready. His destination was kept secret and reports say there were a number of decoy convoys to deceive the media. Police and the military were on high alert across all major cities, and dozens of people were pre-emptively taken into custody. Pakistan's governing party and the army have pointed to the lack of protest over Mr Khan's arrest as a sign that the former PM no longer enjoys the support of the people. But his Pakistan Tehreek-e Insaf (PTI) party and supporters say they have been forced into silence by a swift crackdown. The BBC also understands that media outlets were told not to cover PTI's activities or even mention Mr Khan's name on air following the mass protests in May. Thousands of Mr Khan's supporters have been arrested since May. The army has said they intend to try them in military courts, which human rights groups have said is against international law. The PTI has also been systematically gutted, with numerous party workers and leaders being arrested, or facing court cases. Mr Khan himself still faces some 200 cases. Several PTI members have since defected or quit politics altogether. Ali Akbar, a senior political analyst, said this is why Mr Khan's calls for a protest went unheeded this time - not only did workers and supporters fear arrest, but they were also unable to mobilise support because of the lack of leadership left in PTI. Fatima, a PTI supporter whose name has been changed on request, said police action against party leaders had frightened her into silence - even online. \"I used to still support the party on Twitter, but one day I received a phone call from an anonymous number warning me against posting such tweets. I got scared and my parents also advised me to delete my Twitter account as they said no-one would be able to help me if I were arrested,\" she said. Another party worker said he did not want to put himself in a difficult situation given the police appeared ready to arrest anyone who came forward to protest. \"After so many of their leaders and workers were arrested, my family members are not even allowing me to meet other lady workers of the party,\" says Naheed, a homemaker in the conservative Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwest Pakistan, whose name has been changed on request. She says she began supporting Imran Khan and the PTI after they were ousted from power in April last year. But now, she adds, she is unable to even leave her house, because of the extent of the police action against party workers. Other supporters who spoke to the BBC also said they did not want to protest this time. One man who did not want to be identified said he believed in peaceful demonstration, but was disheartened after the May protests turned violent: \"I don't know who was behind it but I cannot support such violence and destruction.\" But many also said they still support Mr Khan and the PTI, even if they were not doing so publicly. The strength of this \"silent support\" is still visible. The PTI recently won a by-election in an area where it lost last year - and by a notable margin. Anti-establishment stances quickly become popular in Pakistan, says Irfan Khan, a political analyst. \"Earlier when the PTI was in power and the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) took an anti-establishment stance, the PML won by-elections at many seats even in PTI strongholds,\" he said. Mr Khan himself was seen as an ally of the establishment when he rose to power in 2018, and is widely believed to have been ousted after the relationship soured. Many PTI supporters, including Fatima, vow that they will still vote for Mr Khan and his party in the next general election, which is expected to be held later this year. Naheed also says her vote will go to the PTI: \"These actions will not make us leave the PTI. Our love for Imran Khan and the party is only getting stronger, and we will continue to support them.\"",

        "title": "Megan Thee Stallion 'will never be the same' after being shot by Tory Lanez",
        "content": "Megan Thee Stallion has said she will \"never be the same\" after being shot in the feet by fellow rap star Tory Lanez, as a judge prepares to sentence him. Megan, a triple Grammy Award winner, wrote a victim impact statement that was read in court on the first day of the sentencing hearing on Monday. She told his trial last year that Lanez shot her in an argument while leaving a party at Kylie Jenner's home in 2020. Prosecutors have asked the judge to give Lanez a 13-year jail sentence. His lawyers argued he should just get probation and a drug treatment programme. He is expected to be sentenced later on Tuesday. On Monday, Megan's statement was read in court by Los Angeles County's deputy district attorney. \"Since I was viciously shot by the defendant, I have not experienced a single day of peace,\" it said, according to US media. \"Slowly but surely, I'm healing and coming back, but I will never be the same.\" The star said she struggled with whether to give the statement in person, but \"simply could not bring myself to be in a room with Tory again\". Megan, 28, said she had been \"tormented and terrorised\", adding that she \"spiralled to a dark, angry place\" when Lanez mocked her trauma. \"His crime warrants the full weight of the law,\" she said. Lanez, real name Daystar Peterson, has had seven US top 10 albums in the past seven years. Megan told the trial that Lanez opened fire after she mocked his musical talents. Other witnesses who spoke on Monday included Lanez's father, who talked emotionally about the effect on his son of the death of his mother when he was 11, and a prison chaplain, who said Lanez had been leading daily prayer groups. The 31-year-old has been in custody since being found guilty in December of assault with a semi-automatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle; and discharging a firearm with gross negligence. The judge said he had received more than 70 letters in support of Lanez from his family and friends, including rapper Iggy Azalea, who called for a sentence that would be \"transformative, not life-destroying\". The shooting happened when the pair left Jenner's home with his bodyguard and her friend and assistant Kelsey Harris in an SUV in the early hours of 12 July 2020. Megan, real name Megan Pete, told the court she got into an argument with Lanez over their previous sexual relationship. The row escalated and led to the pair insulting each other's careers. She said she demanded to be let out of the vehicle, at which point Lanez started shooting at the ground and shouted at her to \"dance\". But Lanez has maintained his innocence, with his lawyers suggesting Ms Harris may have shot her friend after discovering the relationship because she had a \"crush\" on him and was jealous. Ms Harris denied that. However, on the witness stand she backtracked on previous statements that Lanez was the shooter, instead telling the trial she did not see who shot Megan. Megan initially told police she injured her feet by stepping on broken glass but later revealed she had been shot, and the dispute continued on social media and in the pair's songs. Fans of the two stars - and some famous names in the hip-hop world - also took sides as they disagreed about who was telling the truth. In Elle magazine in April, Megan called the guilty verdict \"a victory for every woman who has ever been shamed, dismissed, and blamed for a violent crime committed against them\". \"We can't control what others think, especially when the lies are juicier than the truth,\" she said.",

        "content": "Renowned Spanish actor Rodolfo Sancho Aguirre's son has been charged with murder for killing and dismembering a man in Thailand. Daniel Sancho Bronchalo, 29, pleaded guilty to the murder of Edwin Arrieta Arteaga, 44, in a Thai court on Monday. Police discovered parts of Arrieta's body at a landfill in the southern island of Koh Phangan last week. Mr Sancho told Spanish news agency EFE he had been a \"hostage\"to Arrieta, who was obsessed with him. The YouTube chef went to a Koh Phangan police station last Thursday to report that Arrieta, a Colombian surgeon, was missing, local media reported. Koh Phangan is a popular beach destination known for its raucous 'full moon' parties. Mr Sancho filed the report shortly after human remains were discovered by trash collectors that morning, with more discovered the following day at the same location. Through DNA tests, police determined that the remains were those of Arrieta. Questioned again on Friday, Mr Sancho admitted to killing him. On Sunday, he led police to seven sites, where he allegedly disposed of the victim's dismembered body in plastic bags. Local media reported that investigations showed Mr Sancho had bought, among other things, a knife, rubber gloves and a bottle of cleaning agent last Tuesday, leading police to conclude that he had made plans to kill Arrieta. Mr Sancho hails from a well-known Spanish acting dynasty. His mother is the actress Silvia Bronchalo, while his grandfather is the late actor F\u00e9lix \u00c1ngel Sancho Gracia. Mr Sancho's family released a statement on Sunday asking for \"maximum respect, both for Daniel Sancho himself and for the whole family, in these delicate moments of maximum confusion.\" He is currently being held in a prison on the island of Koh Samui as police continue their investigation into the murder, which they allege is premeditated, and has been denied bail. The search for the rest of Arrieta's remains continues.",

        "title": "Kanye West performs at Travis Scott concert after antisemitism scandal",
        "content": "Kanye West made a surprise appearance on stage when he joined Travis Scott at his Utopia tour in Rome. It's his first public performance since he caused controversy by posting a series of antisemitic remarks online. Kanye, who's legally changed his name to Ye, performed two tracks with fellow US rapper Travis at the Circus Maximus stadium on Monday night. Travis said his music had been inspired by Kanye, telling the crowd: \"There is no Travis Scott without Kanye West.\" Kanye was dropped by brands and banned from social media in October over a string of antisemitic posts. He had accused rapper Diddy of being controlled by Jewish people on Instagram, appearing to reference an antisemitic conspiracy theory that a secret cabal of Jewish people is trying to control governments, banks and the media. Kanye then tweeted he would go \"death con 3 Oon Jewish people\", getting him banned there too. Brands like Adidas also sought to distance themselves from him - although last week they revealed they had made millions selling his Yeezy trainers. Kanye has previously spoken about being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and his mental health struggles. His account was re-instated on X, formerly known as Twitter, last week - but he hasn't posted yet. Monday's performance with Travis - whose new album Utopia has just topped the charts - marked Kanye's first performance since the controversy. In footage shared from the concert on social media, Travis told the 60,000 fans: \"It's been a long journey before we could get here. \"There is no Utopia without Kanye West. There is no Travis Scott without Kanye West. There is no Rome without Kanye West. Make some noise for Ye.\" The pair performed Kanye's songs Praise God and Can't Tell Me Nothing together. The concert followed a last-minute cancellation of Travis' planned live show in front of the pyramids in Egypt. Egyptian authorities said they had safety concerns about the concert following the death of 10 fans in a crowd surge at his 2021 Astroworld gig in Houston in the United States. Travis has insisted that will still go ahead, promising to share a new date soon. Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube. Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "title": "New York beach officials use drones to search for sharks amid a spate of attacks on swimmers",
        "content": "WANTAGH, N.Y. \u2014 Off the coast of Long Island, drones sweep over the ocean, patrolling the water for any danger that might lurk below the surface as beachgoers grow more vigilant because of a recent spate of shark encounters. Over two days this week, five people reported being bitten by sharks at some of New York\u2019s most popular beaches, leading to heightened surveillance of the area\u2019s waters. The sighting of a 10-foot shark on Thursday prompted officials to keep people out of the water at Robert Moses State Park, the same Long Island beach that delayed its opening July 4 after a drone spotted a group of 50 sand sharks off the coast. \u201cWe are now more vigilant than ever,\u201d said George Gorman, the state\u2019s park director in Long Island. \u201cWe have drones in the sky that watch over the waters. We have lifeguards on WaveRunners that watch over the waters.\u201d Just a few years ago, encounters with sharks were rare. But more recently, reports of sharks biting people have increased. Last year, eight people reported being bitten by sharks swimming in the shallows off Long Island\u2019s beaches. \u201cThis year, we\u2019ve already had five bites,\u201d Gorman said, \u201cand the season has kind of just begun.\u201d Even if the injuries have not been serious, he and others are concerned by the rise in shark sightings and encounters. Cary Epstein, a lifeguard supervisor who pilots drones at Jones Beach, said the tiny battery-powered aircraft make three sweeps each day: once before opening, then sometime midday and a final round before the end of the day. \u201cDespite the nervousness over what\u2019s going on right now in New York, people swim in the ocean every day, and they have for centuries,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do have to remember that we are cohabitating, and this is their house.\u201d Drones provide an additional vantage point unavailable to lifeguards on the beach, Epstein said as he demonstrated how he uses the drones to patrol the waters off Long Island. As he operated one of the drones from the beach, he stared into a small box equipped with controls and a display screen. The craft lifted off, hovering over the sand until it hurled forward over the water and turned into a mere dot as it approached the horizon. \u201cWhen you\u2019re up in an elevated lifeguard station or a lifeguard stand, you can see up and you can see out, but you can\u2019t see straight down,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cWhen we do have sharks that are eating on these fish, it\u2019s very, very clear to us. You could see it, no questions asked.\u201d But, he warned, \u201cjust because you don\u2019t see something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there.\u201d Just two months ago, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced the addition of 10 drones to its squadron, bringing the total to 18 that can be used to monitor shark activity along her state\u2019s beaches. \u201cWith New Yorkers and visitors alike preparing to enjoy our beautiful Long Island beaches all summer long, their safety is our top priority,\u201d Hochul said in May. \u201cThis year we are taking further action to protect beachgoers by increasing surveillance to monitor for shark activity near beaches off the South Shore.\u201d An increase in shark sightings might suggest a healthier ecosystem, some say. Cleaner waters allow the small fish that sharks feed on to flourish. More small fish swimming closer to shore means more sharks nipping at their tails. Prior to 2022, New York had only recorded a dozen unprovoked bites. Over the last decade, there were just four people bitten by sharks, according to data compiled by the International Shark Attack File, which tracks shark attacks around the world. Florida is usually the country\u2019s leader in shark bites. There were 16 last year, which was twice as many as runner-up New York. From his elevated perch on the sand at Jones Beach State Park on Thursday, lifeguard Carl Nowicki pointed his gaze out to sea, scanning the water for activity that might attract a hungry shark, such as large schools of bait fish. \u201cIf a drone has spotted a shark, we won\u2019t alert the patrons until they\u2019re all of the water because we don\u2019t want them to freak out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be very transparent once everyone\u2019s on the sand. We don\u2019t want to cause a panic at a beach.\u201d Mike Berchoff, who was enjoying the sun and water at Jones Beach, goes into the water more cautiously these days. He doesn\u2019t want to be the next beachgoer to be bitten by a shark. \u201cI just go out up to my waist. That\u2019s about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t go all the way out there.\u201d He\u2019s seen more drones taking off lately, which he said provides some reassurance that beachgoers would be alerted of danger. The first known encounter of the summer happened Monday when a 15-year-old girl felt a bite on her leg while swimming. At a different beach soon after, another teen had to paddle back to shore after something began nibbling on his toes. A day later, on the Fourth of July, two men reported bites possibly by sharks in two separate encounters 60 miles apart. This is not the same kind of horror that terrorized the fictional East Coast town of Amity Island in the terrifying movie thriller \u201cJaws.\u201d For one thing, it\u2019s unlikely the marine animals involved in recent encounters were the fear-inducing great white sharks that linger in deeper waters and are rarely seen close enough to shore to be of real concern. About a dozen species of sharks swim off the coast of Long Island, none of them considered particularly ferocious, including the sand sharks that are more common in the area and grow to nearly 15 feet. Their sharp, jagged teeth might cause a fright, but the giant fish are usually docile and typically avoid human contact. A nursery for juvenile sharks is known to exist off Fire Island. Sand sharks are unlikely to attack humans unless provoked, according to shark biologists. If they do interact with swimmers, it\u2019s usually unintentional.",

        "title": "Niger coup leaders refuse to let senior U.S. diplomat meet with nation\u2019s president",
        "content": "A senior U.S. diplomat said coup leaders in Niger refused to allow her to meet Monday with the West African country\u2019s democratically elected president, whom she described as under \u201cvirtual house arrest.\u201d Acting Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland also described the mutinous officers as unreceptive to U.S. pressure to return the country to civilian rule. \u201cThey were quite firm about how they want to proceed, and it is not in support of the constitution of Niger,\u201d Nuland told reporters. She characterized the conversations as \u201cextremely frank and at times quite difficult.\u201d She spoke after a two-hour meeting in Niger\u2019s capital, Niamey, with some leaders of the military takeover of a country that has been a vital counterterrorism partner of the United States. In speaking to junta leaders, Nuland said, she made \u201cabsolutely clear the kinds of support that we will legally have to cut off if democracy is not restored.\u201d If the U.S. determines that a democratically elected government has been toppled by unconstitutional means, federal law requires a cutoff of most American assistance, particularly military aid. She said she also stressed U.S. concern for the welfare of President Mohamed Bazoum, who she said was being detained with his wife and son. The meeting was with Gen. Moussa Salaou Barmou, a U.S.-trained officer, and three of the colonels involved in the takeover. The coup\u2019s top leader, former presidential guard head Abdourahamane Tchiani, did not meet with the Americans. In other developments Monday, leaders of West Africa\u2019s regional bloc said they would meet later this week to discuss next steps after the junta defied a deadline to reinstate the president. The meeting was scheduled for Thursday in Abuja, the capital of neighboring Nigeria, according to a spokesman for the ECOWAS bloc. Meanwhile, the junta\u2019s mutinous soldiers closed the country\u2019s airspace and accused foreign powers of preparing an attack. State television reported the junta\u2019s latest actions Sunday night, hours before the deadline set by ECOWAS, which has warned of using military force if Bazoum is not returned to power. A spokesman for the coup leaders, Col. Maj. Amadou Abdramane, noted \u201cthe threat of intervention being prepared in a neighboring country,\u201d and said Niger\u2019s airspace will be closed until further notice. Any attempt to fly over the country will be met with \u201can energetic and immediate response.\u201d The junta also claimed that two central African countries were preparing for an invasion, but did not name them. It called on Niger\u2019s population to defend the nation. The coup toppled Bazoum, whose ascendency was Niger\u2019s first peaceful, democratic transfer of power since independence from France in 1960. The coup also raised questions about the future of the fight against extremism in Africa\u2019s Sahel region, where Russia and Western countries have vied for influence. Niger had been seen by the United States and others as the last major counterterrorism partner in the Sahel, south of the Sahara Desert, where groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group are expanding their influence. Also Monday, Mali said it and Burkina Faso, both neighbors of Niger run by military juntas, were sending delegations to Niger to show support. Both countries have said they would consider any intervention in Niger as a declaration of war against them. Regional tensions have mounted since the coup nearly two weeks ago, when mutinous soldiers detained Bazoum and installed Tchiani as head of state. Analysts believe the coup was triggered by a power struggle between Tchiani and the president, who was about to fire him. It was not immediately clear what ECOWAS leaders will do now. The region is divided on a course of action. There was no sign of military forces gathering at Niger\u2019s border with Nigeria, the likely entry point by land. Nigeria\u2019s Senate has pushed back on the plan to invade, urging Nigeria\u2019s president, the bloc\u2019s current chair, to explore options other than the use of force. ECOWAS can still move ahead, as final decisions are made by consensus by member states. Guinea and neighboring Algeria, which is not an ECOWAS member, have come out against the use of force. Senegal\u2019s government has said it would participate in a military operation if it went ahead, and Ivory Coast has expressed support for the bloc\u2019s efforts to restore constitutional order. The junta has asked for help from the Russian mercenary group Wagner, according to Wassim Nasr, a journalist and senior research fellow at the Soufan Center. However, Nuland indicated that coup leaders did not seem receptive to welcoming Wagner mercenaries into the country, as has happened with several surrounding unstable West African countries. \u201cI will say that I got the sense from my meetings today that the people who have taken the action here understand very well the risks to their sovereignty when Wagner is invited,\u201d Nuland said. The junta is exploiting anti-French sentiments to shore up its support base and has severed security ties with France, which still has 1,500 military personnel in Niger for counterterrorism efforts. On Monday, France\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally discouraged any travel to Niger, Burkina Faso or Mali, and called on French nationals to be extremely vigilant. France has suspended almost 500 million euros ($550 million) in aid to Burkina Faso. It\u2019s not clear what will happen to the French military presence, or to the 1,100 U.S. military personnel also in Niger. Many people, largely youth, have rallied around the junta, taking to the streets at night to patrol after being urged to guard against foreign intervention. \u201cWhile they (jihadists) kill our brothers and sisters ... ECOWAS didn\u2019t intervene. Is it now that they will intervene?\u201d said Amadou Boukari, a coup supporter at Sunday\u2019s rally. \u201cShame on ECOWAS.\u201d",

        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden\u2019s brand as a family-oriented public servant has been a signature political asset that for more than 50 years has helped him win the argument that, when judged against \u201cthe alternative\u201d rather than \u201cthe Almighty,\u201d he stacks up pretty well. He\u2019s never lost to a general-election opponent in a political career that\u2019s taken him from Delaware\u2019s New Castle County Council to the Oval Office. But the burnish on Biden\u2019s brand is being tested like never before, ahead of a close 2024 election. Some of the president\u2019s Democratic allies are worried about potential fallout from a confluence of family drama that\u2019s spilled into public view and from Republican attacks that cut at the bedrock of Biden\u2019s longtime political appeal. The GOP-led House is investigating the extent of Biden\u2019s role in helping his son Hunter Biden earn millions of dollars from foreign business interests during his time as vice president. Republicans also say Biden\u2019s Justice Department tried to give Hunter Biden a \u201csweetheart\u201d plea deal on federal tax and firearm possession charges \u2014 a deal that fell apart last month after a judge questioned its terms. At the same time, a federal special counsel is investigating Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents following his two terms as vice president. In a matter of a much more personal nature, Biden recently acknowledged for the first time that he has a seventh grandchild \u2014 Navy Joan Roberts, the 4-year-old daughter of Hunter Biden, who wrote in a memoir that he doesn\u2019t remember his \u201cencounter\u201d with her mother. \u201cThe recent revelations with Hunter Biden really are in conflict with the current perception of his image of being squeaky clean,\u201d Mike Noble, the CEO of the nonpartisan Noble Predictive Insights and a preeminent pollster in the Southwest, said of the president.  Noble said that in his firm\u2019s trackers \u2014 including in the key 2024 states of Arizona and Nevada \u2014 Biden\u2019s image regularly tests better than his job approval. \u201cI think this potentially impacts his image,\u201d he said of the various criticisms of Biden and his family. Democrats who are concerned about the possible political damage to Biden\u2019s reputation are more reticent, and they privately note that this GOP narrative is different from criticism of the president\u2019s age \u2014 80 \u2014 or his handling of the economy because it\u2019s so central to the type of leadership he\u2019s offering voters. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why his numbers are the way they are,\u201d said one Democratic strategist, referring to the president\u2019s low approval rating among Americans. Like other Democrats, the strategist requested anonymity to avoid retribution from fellow partisans.  \u201cIt\u2019s not just the economy,\u201d the strategist said of possible reasons behind Biden\u2019s low job approval. \u201cIt\u2019s not because people are just concerned about inflation. It\u2019s not just because people are concerned about his age. His brand has been damaged by him and those around him.\u201d Nodding to the fear Democrats have of being blamed for weakening their own candidate \u2014 or incurring his wrath \u2014 the strategist emphatically declined to put his name to his remarks: \u201cOn the record? F--- no! Are you crazy?\u201d he said. In June, an NBC News poll found that 48% of those surveyed held a negative view of the president and 39% had a positive view. Another 12% were neutral.   Earlier this year, a Pew Research Center poll showed 65% of Americans feared Republicans would spend too much time in Congress talking about Hunter Biden and not enough on kitchen table issues.  Still, Republicans plan to spend the next 15 months trying to diminish Biden\u2019s powerful political asset as much as possible. On Monday, the political action committee of former President Donald Trump \u2014 the current front-runner for the Republican nomination \u2014 released a new ad that casts the president as dishonest about his role in Hunter Biden\u2019s lucrative foreign business dealings. The PAC, Make America Great Again, is spending $1.9 million on the ad, according to a spokesperson. Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said recent data collected by Campaign Nucleus, a platform that measures public opinion, show at least a glimmer of weakness where Biden has long found strength. Parscale, a partner in the firm that runs Campaign Nucleus, said while Biden\u2019s personal approval is at 43%, positive sentiment about issues involving his family is lower \u2014 at 40%. \u201cThis net negative sentiment of 3% is a notable drag on his overall appeal,\u201d Parscale said. In the 2024 election, Biden will have to rely on voters to look past any discomfort with the nicks in his narrative when they compare him to the alternative \u2014 which current polling shows is likely to be Trump, who has been indicted three times and impeached twice. Though Biden and Trump are effectively tied in recent national polling, Democrats say they are confident Biden\u2019s record \u2014 both in terms of policies and character \u2014 stands up much better to scrutiny than Trump\u2019s. \u201cRepublicans have spent four years and millions of dollars spreading lies about President Biden and his family because it\u2019s easier than talking about their deeply unpopular and extreme agenda,\u201d said Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t worked, and it never will, because Americans know that Joe Biden is a fundamentally decent person who loves his family and whose devotion to his country has made him one of the most effective presidents in a generation,\u201d Moussa said. Yet there is some concern within the party that the Hunter Biden storylines are creating a distraction from Trump\u2019s character and the substantive policy issues the president\u2019s team believes will ultimately decide the election. Felisia Martin, vice chair of the state Democratic Party in electoral battleground Wisconsin, said there is growing frustration among Democrats in her state about the focus on Hunter Biden over issues like inflation. \u201cWe voted for Joe Biden to be president of the United States, not Hunter Biden,\u201d said Martin, who also is a member of the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors. \u201cHunter Biden doesn\u2019t have a position in the Biden-Harris administration, therefore, I\u2019m not concerned unless there is proof that the president has something to do with some nefarious dealings.\u201d Republicans, and news organizations, have not found evidence that Biden received money from any of Hunter Biden\u2019s business relationships.  In 2019, Joe Biden wrote a post on X \u2014 then called Twitter \u2014 claiming, \u201cI\u2019ve never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d But late last month, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre shifted that stance amid revelations that House Republicans had uncovered evidence of Hunter Biden talking to his father while meeting with business associates. \u201cThe president,\u201d Pierre said, as she recalibrated the White House response to questions about whether the two Bidens had spoken about business ventures, \u201cwas never in business with his son.\u201d Last week, Devon Archer, who was one of Hunter Biden\u2019s business partners, testified in a closed session before the House Oversight Committee about the importance of the Biden \u201cbrand\u201d \u2014 specifically Hunter Biden\u2019s proximity to his father \u2014 in securing and maintaining business, according to a publicly released transcript of his meeting with House investigators. Indeed, the power of the Biden name likely helped Hunter Biden at nearly every turn of his career: from consulting for MBNA, a Delaware-based bank whose employees were a major source of campaign money for the elder Biden, and lobbying Congress while his father was a senator; to winning an appointment to Amtrak\u2019s board from President George W. Bush and earning large sums from foreign business dealings when his father was vice president. Archer recounted two dinners with Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign associates that Joe Biden attended at a Washington, D.C., restaurant when he was vice president. The dinners included a Russian real estate magnate and a top executive at Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that hired Hunter Biden as a consultant. Archer testified that he is unaware of any official U.S. government action taken on behalf of Burisma. In general, he testified, the younger Biden \u201cwould sometimes make it apparent that he spoke to his dad\u201d or put his father on speaker phone when interacting with investors and business contacts. The conversations were casual, according to Archer\u2019s testimony, but gave the impression of closeness between father and son. Archer also said he had no knowledge of wrongdoing by the president. Democrats say there\u2019s no comparison between Trump and Biden when it comes to self-dealing \u2014 and that they hope that is obvious to the electorate.  Trump was indicted by special counsel Jack Smith on various charges related to his alleged attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election and wrongfully retaining classified documents after leaving office. He was also indicted by the Manhattan district attorney on charges of falsifying business records. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The special counsel investigating Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents after his time as vice president has not announced any conclusion to the probe, but one is expected in the coming months. Biden has said he unwittingly possessed classified documents after leaving the vice presidency. Whether the \u201cfamily man\u201d brand issue becomes a problem for Biden in the 2024 campaign, there may be little he can do at this point to affect it, in the view of some of his allies. And Biden allies hope voters will see his decisions as him being a caring father and won\u2019t penalize him for that. \u201cWhat is he supposed to do, cut his son off because he wants to be president?\u201d said former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, D-Ill. \u201cYou don\u2019t stop being a dad because you want to be vice president or president.\u201d Democrats close to Biden said Republicans will be hard-pressed to tear down a brand that has been built over decades. Biden\u2019s reputation for empathy also is one reason that Democrats are reluctant to publicly criticize his handling of his relationship with Hunter Biden. In many cases, that empathy is something they\u2019ve experienced themselves. Bill Houlihan, a Democratic strategist and longtime aide to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., recalled how years ago when he told Biden that his mother was turning 90, Biden told Houlihan to get his mother on the phone and then wished her a happy birthday. \u201cMy mom told that story until she died,\u201d Houlihan said. \u201cYou don\u2019t do that to make a name for yourself; you do that because you love people.\u201d Yet in some ways, the most prominent aspect of Joe Biden\u2019s political brand \u2014 that he\u2019s a family man \u2014 has recently taken the biggest hit. Biden has held Hunter Biden \u2014 his only surviving son and a recovering drug addict \u2014 so publicly close that some Democrats have privately raised concerns that doing so hurts him politically. Yet it wasn\u2019t until last month, amid Republican criticism and some friendly admonishments, that Biden acknowledged he has a seventh grandchild. The president was waiting until after Hunter Biden resolved his legal disputes with Navy\u2019s mother, Lunden Roberts, before opening his arms to his granddaughter, according to people close to him. That legal settlement, however, reportedly precludes Navy from using the Biden family name.",

        "title": "Hunter Biden business associate testifies he has no knowledge of wrongdoing by Joe Biden",
        "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Hunter Biden\u2019s business associate, Devon Archer, testified before the House Oversight Committee that he has no knowledge that then-Vice President Joe Biden changed U.S. foreign policy to help his son and that he's not aware of any wrongdoing by the elder Biden, according to transcripts of his testimony released Thursday. \u201cI have no basis to know if he altered policy to benefit his son. \u2026 I have no knowledge,\u201d Archer testified in the closed-door hearing earlier this week. One of the GOP\u2019s key witnesses in its investigation into the Bidens, Archer told lawmakers that Hunter Biden repeatedly used the Joe Biden \u201cbrand\u201d to protect Burisma \"so people would be intimidated to mess with them\" legally and politically. But he quickly added: \"On this line of questioning, I have no, like, proof.\" Archer also said that he did not disagree with the conclusion that Hunter Biden\u2019s role on the board of Ukrainian energy firm Burisma had no effect on U.S. foreign policy. And Archer testified that he had no knowledge of any wrongdoing by Joe Biden as it related to his son\u2019s business dealings. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not aware of any,\u201d Archer said during his more than five-hour deposition. The witness also said there were roughly 20 phone calls in which Hunter Biden would put his father on speakerphone in the presence of business associates, but he said that the brief conversations focused on pleasantries like the weather or fishing, not official business. But Archer testified that those mundane phone calls were meant to convey access and power. Without Hunter Biden, Burisma might not have survived, Archer said. \u201cI think Burisma would have gone out of business if it didn\u2019t have the brand attached to it. That\u2019s my, like, only honest opinion,\u201d Archer said. The witness also described two dinners \u2014 a birthday dinner and another on the World Food Programme \u2014 attended by Hunter and Joe Biden in 2014 and 2015 at Washington\u2019s Cafe Milano. Some foreign business executives and politicians were present, but Archer said Joe Biden didn\u2019t discuss business. Hunter Biden was chairman of the board for World Food Program USA at the time. Oversight Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., released Archer\u2019s 141-page transcript on the same day former President Donald Trump is set to be arraigned at a federal courthouse in Washington for charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The testimony hands Republicans descriptive details about Hunter Biden and more ammunition as they accuse the Justice Department of aggressively prosecuting Trump for multiple crimes while going easy on Hunter Biden on federal tax and other charges. Witnesses typically get an opportunity to review transcripts so they can make any corrections, but it appeared that Republicans rushed to publicize the Archer transcript. Archer's attorney, Matthew Schwartz, said in an email that he and his client \"cannot confirm the accuracy of the transcript that was released, as Committee staffers gave us only a handful of hours to review it before it was made public.\u201d The transcripts appear to back up Democrats, including Reps. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., and Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., who have argued that Comer\u2019s investigation into the Bidens has revealed no direct evidence that Joe Biden was involved in his son\u2019s business dealings, was influenced by them or broke the law. \u201cOnce again, Committee Republicans\u2019 priority investigation into President Biden has failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden. On Monday, Devon Archer, Hunter Biden\u2019s former business associate, confirmed in a transcribed interview that President Biden was never involved in Hunter\u2019s business dealings, never profited from such dealings, and never took official action in relation to these business dealings,\u201d Raskin, the top Democrat on the Oversight panel, said in a statement. \u201cThe transcript released today shows the extent to which Congressional Republicans are willing to distort, twist, and manipulate the facts presented by their own witness just to keep fueling the far-right media\u2019s obsession with fabricating wrongdoing by President Biden in a desperate effort to distract from Donald Trump\u2019s third indictment and the overwhelming evidence of his persistent efforts to undermine American democracy.\u201d At one point in the deposition, Schwartz, wanted his client to clarify several points Archer made earlier about the limitations of his knowledge about Joe Biden. \u201cIt is still true that you are not aware that Hunter Biden ever discussed policy with his father, discussed business with his father, influenced American policy for purposes of his business or otherwise caused the Vice President or asked the Vice President to do anything improper, right?\u201d Schwartz asked. \u201cThat\u2019s my understanding,\u201d Archer replied.  Goldman, the Democratic lawmaker, participated in the deposition and asked Archer to clarify that Hunter Biden was not necessarily selling access to Joe Biden, then the vice president, but the \u201cillusion of access.\u201d \u201cSo is it fair to say that Hunter Biden was selling the illusion of access to his father? Goldman asked.  \u201cYes,\u201d Archer replied, adding that the Biden son and father spoke almost daily \u201cbut nothing of material was discussed.\u201d Earlier in the deposition, Archer told Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say\u201d that when he refers to Hunter Biden selling the Biden \u201cbrand\u201d he is referring to the Joe Biden brand. But then, later in the deposition, after a break and conferring with his counsel, Archer said Hunter Biden was creating the appearance of access to Washington in general. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s the appearance to all of D.C.,\u201d Archer said. The Trump family is briefly mentioned during Archer\u2019s testimony. After questioning from Goldman, Archer recalled he did once \u201cplay behind\u201d Donald Trump in golf. Trump approached him at the clubhouse and said he did not like Archer\u2019s athletic shorts. \u201cWould you say that Donald Trump\u2019s children benefit from their last name being Trump?\u201d Goldman asked. \u201cI would speculate to say, yes,\u201d Archer replied. In a statement Thursday afternoon, a White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations blasted House Republicans, saying they \"keep promising bombshell evidence to support their false, ridiculous attacks against the President, but time after time, they keep failing to produce any.\" \"In fact, even their own witnesses are debunking their allegations,\" Ian Sams said.",
